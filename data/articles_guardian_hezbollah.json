        "text": "\nIsrael’s political and military leadership appears to have concluded that a conflict with Lebanon’s Hezbollah is becoming increasingly likely, despite months of growing warnings that a third Lebanese war would be more dangerous and deadly than the last war in 2006. \nThe mounting tensions on the northern border with Syria and Lebanon have increased in recent months as Israel has recognised its assumption that Hezbollah – a key ally fighting with the Assad regime – would be chewed up in a protracted Syrian conflict is badly mistaken as the war has turned rapidly in Bashar al-Assad’s favour.\nInstead the Iranian-backed group appears to be emerging from the Syrian war as a battle-hardened and largely conventional military force whose missiles have been heavily resupplied by Tehran despite dozens of Israeli airstrikes on convoys and depots.\nAmid threats by Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, that Israel would intervene rather than allow Iran or Iranian-backed groups to establish themselves on Israel’s border, the sense of growing risk of conflict has been given added impetus in the recent convergence of Israeli, Saudi Arabian and US rhetoric against Iran.\n\n\n\n\nThe Guardian view on Lebanon: great power rivalry in a tiny state | Editorial\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Israel, however, the talk of war with Hezbollah has escalated. with top military and political figures detailing the probable shape of a future conflict, and Israel’s then air force chief suggesting that Lebanon could be subjected to a huge aerial bombardment in the opening days of a campaign with civilian casualties highly probable.\n“If a war breaks out in the northern arena we need to act with full force from the beginning,” Israel’s outgoing air force commander, Maj Gen Amir Eshel, told the Herzliya conference in June shortly before stepping down. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Hezbollah now has 20,000 highly trained fighters, 25,000 reservists and upwards of 100,000 missiles, according to estimates. Photograph: Mahmoud Zayyat/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\n“What we could do in 34 days during the second Lebanon war we can now do in 48 to 60 hours. The growth of our strength has not been linear.\n“This is potential power unimaginable in its scope, much different to what we have seen in the past and far greater than people estimate.”\nSpeaking at a ceremony in October, Israel’s combative rightwing defence minister, Avigdor Lieberman, suggested that the Lebanese military could also be considered an enemy combatant alongside Hezbollah.\n“We’re talking about Hezbollah and the Lebanese military and, unfortunately, this is the reality,” he told soldiers at Israel’s military headquarters, suggesting that the Lebanese army had lost its independence and had become an integral part of Hezbollah’s network. \n“If war breaks out in the north, we have to open with all our strength from the start,” Lieberman said.\nThe reality, however, is that despite remarks by Netanyahu in talking up the coincidence of Saudi-led Sunni opposition to Iran and its proxies in the Middle East, the recent bellicose Saudi moves complicate issues for Israel. \nIsraeli commentators – as well as the former US ambassador to Israel Dan Shapiro – have also warned of the risk of Israel getting sucked into a conflict on Saudi terms.\n“It is plausible that the Saudis are trying to create the context for a different means of contesting Iran in Lebanon – an Israeli-Hezbollah war,” said Shapiro in an op-ed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Avigdor Lieberman, the Israeli defence minister: ‘If war breaks out in the north, we have to open with all our strength from the start.’ Photograph: Ronen Zvulun/Reuters\n\n\nHe added: “Israeli leaders will want to take care not to find themselves backed into a premature confrontation by the manoeuvres of their allies who sit in Riyadh.”\nShapiro has not been alone in warning of the risk. The military commentator of the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, Amos Harel, delivered a similar warning, not least over an unplanned escalation from “a local incident gone out of control”. \n“If Saudi Arabia is deliberately stoking the flames between the sides [Israel and Hezbollah], this becomes a tangible danger.”\nOther commentators have pointed to Saudi Arabian policy in Syria, Yemen and Qatar that has been as reckless as it has been ineffective, warning an intervention in Lebanon would result in a stronger Iranian influence there.\nThe reality, as made clear by the head of the Israeli military’s intelligence directorate, Herzl Halevi, in a speech last year is that any conflict in the north with Hezbollah would “not be simple or easy”.\nSince the war in 2006 Hezbollah has emerged as the most capable and resilient non-state military actor, with 20,000 full-time and highly trained fighters, 25,000 reservists and upwards of 100,000 missiles, according to estimates.\nRecent large-scale Israeli war games suggest too that any conflict could play out in an entirely different way to the last war, with 1,500-2,000 rockets being fired per day and even efforts to infiltrate Israeli communities by fighters crossing the border.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Hezbollah fighters carry the coffin of Mustafa Badreddine, a top commander killed fighting in Syria, during his funeral in Beirut in May 2016. Photograph: Anwar Amro/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\nThen there is the wider question of whether a limited war could be contained without bringing in other actors.\nWriting in Foreign Affairs in October, Dmitry Adamsky, who teaches diplomacy and strategy at the Interdisciplinary Centre in Herzliya, asked a question long festering in the background.\n“Israeli strategists do not question the likelihood of a war with Hezbollah,” wrote Adamsky. “But they wonder how Russia, which is a comrade-in-arms with Iran and Hezbollah in Syria, would respond to such a conflict.”\nFinally, if there is one thing mitigating in favour of rhetoric rather than military action, it is the reputation of Netanyahu for being as chronically risk averse as he is fond of making big threats over the years.\n"

        "text": "\nIsrael has shot down what it claims was an Iranian-supplied Hezbollah reconnaissance drone over the Syrian border only hours before a speech at the UN by the country’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, in which he is expected to warn of the growing threat from Iran and its proxies on Israel’s northern border.\nThe drone, which Israeli military sources claimed took off from an airfield close to the Syrian capital, Damascus, was shot down by a Patriot missile from a battery deployed near the town of Safed just north of the Sea of Galilee.\nInitial reports suggested that the drone had entered Israeli airspace before being amended to suggest it was shot down in the demilitarised zone near the Syrian border village of Quneitra.\nImages on social media showed the trail of the Patriot in the skies above Safed.\nThe Israeli military said the drone was successfully intercepted by a single missile over the Golan Heights after two fighter jets were also scrambled to the border area.\nThe incident occurred only a few hours before Netanyahu was due to speak at the UN general assembly. It is expected he will call for stronger international efforts against Iran – including strengthening the mandate for inspections of sites potentially associated with its nuclear programme and action to push back Iran and its ally Hezbollah from Israel’s northern border.\nAn Israeli military spokesman told the Guardian that it was not the first occasion in which it had detected Hezbollah drones conducting reconnaissance near Israel’s border.\n“It was detected taking off from a military airfield in Damascus and turned west before then turning and approaching the border with the demilitarised zone. \n“When it crossed two jets were scrambled before it was engaged with a single Patriot missile.” The spokesman added that although it was not clear whether the drone was carrying a weapon, intelligence suggested it had been supplied to Hezbollah by Iran. “We have seen a significant recent rise in [Hezbollah’s] drone capability,” he added.\n"

        "text": "\nIn the 11 months since Donald Trump’s election, Tehran has been at pains to avoid kneejerk reactions. In a country of a thousand Friday prayer podiums, the measured responses to the US president’s pronouncements on Iranian activities have revealed much effort behind the scenes to grapple with changed circumstances. \nBut Tehran’s response this week to reports that the US is working to designate the Revolutionary Guards a terrorist group is an indication that there is a limit to its patience. It is also ratcheting up tensions in an already tense week, which could lead to the undoing of the 2015 nuclear deal. \nTrump faces a congressional deadline of the end of this week to certify Tehran’s compliance under the agreement. He has threatened to decertify it, which could unravel the accord despite the wishes of Washington’s European allies, the majority of the international community and the US military. \nThere is uncertainty over the extent to which the president will go to show his disdain for the agreement, which was a major foreign policy achievement of the Obama administration. Trump could announce some symbolic new sanctions or restore nuclear-related sanctions in blatant violation of the agreement.\nBut one threat has sparked jitters. The Iranian foreign ministry has said the Islamic Republic will show a crushing response should the US list the Revolutionary Guards as a terrorist entity. Although the elite forces have been accused of supporting groups such as Hamas and Hezbollah, they have so far been spared being labelled a terrorist group. \n“We are hopeful that the US does not make this strategic mistake,” Bahram Qasemi, the ministry’s spoksman, said in quotes carried by the state news agency Irna. “If they do, Iran’s reaction would be firm, decisive and crushing, and the US should bear all its consequences.” \nThe previous day, state media in Iran reported the head of the Revolutionary Guards threatening the US regional military bases if it was designated a terrorist group. \n“As we’ve announced in the past, if America’s new law for sanctions is passed, this country will have to move their regional bases outside the 2,000km range of Iran’s missiles,” Maj Gen Mohammad Ali Jafari was quoted as saying. \nThe European Union has made it clear that it fully supports the nuclear deal, and the International Atomic Energy Agency has confirmed eight times that Tehran is complying with it. Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, has even suggested the agreement should serve as a model to resolve the North Korean crisis. Theresa May, the British prime minister, told her Israeli counterpart, Benjamin Netanyahu, on Monday that the UK remained firmly committed to the deal and believed it was vitally important for regional security.\n\n\n\n\nThis Iran nuclear deal is built to last | Richard Dalton\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAndrew Keller, a former deputy assistant secretary of state for sanctions and counter threat finance, told the Guardian that Trump’s decertification of the deal would be an own goal, and designating the Guards as a terrorist group would be futile and detrimental to the agreement. \n “It could lead to the unravelling of the deal at a time when Iran is reportedly complying and more and more businesses are engaging as a result of sanctions relief. In other words, the deal is working as we intended it to work. Sanctions may not ultimately be reimposed, but decertification will destabilise the deal for governments and businesses alike,” he said. \n“The IRGC [the Guards] is already subject to multiple US sanctions. Piling on another terrorist designation seems unlikely to stop any IRGC activity, but it will add to the compliance challenges facing businesses engaging in Iran.”\nRichard Dalton, a former British ambassador to Tehran, said designating the Guards a terrorist group would be a major escalation. “Iran has always been reluctant to butt up against the US because they know they can’t beat America by far so it’s difficult to know how much of [their recent reaction] is bluster and how much is real,” he said. “I don’t think the Iranians want to get into a shooting war with the US, even a skirmish in Iraq or Syria.”\nDalton said Trump seemed intent on getting to “deal with Iran as a bad actor”, which would translate to “a package of sanctions recommended to Congress, a diplomatic offensive with allies, a statement of policy on missiles or sunset clauses or military site inspections – perhaps linked to extra sanctions, further discouragement of non-US businesses (nixing Airbus along with Boeing [deals with Iran]) and reinforcing EU banks’ concern”.\nAccording to Dalton, ditching the Iran deal would make it impossible to continue to monitor Iran’s nuclear programme “so thoroughly” and “risks setting the United States on a path of conflict with Iran at the time when the US and the world already have one nuclear crisis in the shape of North Korea.\n“It’s weakening America by causing people to question America’s fidelity to its words and its ability to perceive where its interest lies,” he said. \n“The chilling effect was very real from November 2016 onwards. There are many uncertainties: will the US impose secondary sanctions on countries that buy Iran’s oil? Will they move the clock back in a way which reinstates nuclear-related sanctions lifted in January 2016 or will they simply confine themselves to additional measures that are non-nuclear in nature? How Trump approaches this and how Congress responds is still uncertain and consequently exactly what the Europeans’ reaction will be.”\n"

        "text": "\nSaudi Arabia has ordered its citizens to leave Lebanon immediately, escalating a regional standoff with Iran centred on the fragile state, which it claims is being run by Tehran’s proxy, Hezbollah.\nThe move follows a week of bellicose rhetoric from the Sunni Arab powerhouse about its Shia rival, drawing strong support from Donald Trump and Israel, all three of whom insist Iran is forging strongholds across the region.\nThe standoff has taken tensions between Riyadh and Tehran to new levels and raised fears that decades of distrust and manoeuvrings between the two may be building towards a military confrontation, underwritten by the Trump administration and joined by Israel.\nThe Saudi order for its citizens to leave, also made by the kingdom’s allies in Bahrain and Kuwait, came after the country’s foreign minister, Adel al-Jubeir, said his government would treat Lebanon as a hostile state as long as Hezbollah was in the government. He described Hezbollah’s participation in government as an “act of war” against Saudi Arabia.\nThe Israeli intelligence minister, Yisrael Katz, said on Thursday he believed conditions were ripe for a diplomatic offensive against Iran and Hezbollah at the United Nations, where he said Israel would seek better enforcement of a 2006 ceasefire agreement that called on Hezbollah to disarm and stay away from its border. \nAllegations of a pact, at least on a de facto level, between Saudi Arabia and Israel were given impetus after it was revealed that Israeli diplomats were asked to repeat talking points, almost identical to remarks made by Saudi leaders after Saturday’s resignation of the Lebanese prime minister, Saad Hariri, claiming Hezbollah had made his job impossible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Workers hang a poster of outgoing prime minister Saad Hariri with the Arabic words ‘We are all Saad’ in Beirut. Photograph: Hussein Malla/AP\n\n\nThe emergence of the reported memo sent to Israeli missions around the world strongly echoes public statements made by the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and his defence minister, Avigdor Lieberman.\nHariri’s departure came at the behest of Saudi leaders, who then launched an unprecedented round of anti-Iran rhetoric, led by Hariri, accusing Hezbollah of dominating life in Lebanon and subverting the political system.\n Hariri had led the government in Lebanon for 11 months after five years in exile, mainly in Riyadh. Saudi Arabia was a prominent patron of Hariri, but he had fallen out of favour with his hosts after the collapse of the construction sector, during which a company he chaired, Saudi Oger, incurred large debts. \nIn the past week, Hariri has acted as an envoy for Riyadh, travelling to Bahrain and Abu Dhabi to discuss his resignation. Lebanese officials’ claims that the former leader is being “held hostage” have been ridiculed by Hariri’s staff and senior Saudis.\nHezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, has speculated that Hariri was being held against his will in the kingdom and that it appeared as if Saudi Arabia had forced his resignation. \nFrench President Emmanuel Macron paid an unscheduled visit to Saudi Arabia on Thursday amid the escalating tensions, saying he wanted to “emphasise the importance of Lebanese stability and integrity”.\n“My wish is that all Lebanese political officials live freely in Lebanon... which means having a very demanding stance on those who could threaten any leader”, he added.\n \nAsked if Hariri had sought asylum in France, he said: “We’ve not had any requests.” \nSaudi Arabia and Israel have no diplomatic ties and successive Saudi leaders have said that will not change unless a settlement is reached with the Palestinians.\nIn recent months, senior Israeli politicians have spoken frequently about the role of Iran and Hezbollah in Syria and Lebanon, amid a growing conviction that a war with Hezbollah may be inevitable.\nIsrael has been encouraging the Trump administration to take a tougher stance on Iran, both against the nuclear agreement reached during the Obama administration and the country’s expanding influence. Last month, Trump refused to certify elements of the agreement. \nThere has also been much discreet shuttle diplomacy in recent months and the Saudi minister for Gulf affairs is travelling to Washington for talks on the standoff. Last month the US president’s son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, traveled to Riyadh for an unpublicised meeting with the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Donald Trump met the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, during an offical visit to Riyadh in May. Photograph: Evan Vucci/AP\n\n\nEarlier in the autumn, Israeli officials suggested a senior Saudi official had travelled to Tel Aviv in the first visit of its kind between the two foes. And Netanyahu warned his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, during a meeting that Israel might take unilateral action over Iran’s increasing role to the country’s north. \nNetanyahu told the BBC while in London last month: “When Israelis and the Arabs, all the Arabs and the Israelis, agree on one thing, people should pay attention. We should stop this Iranian takeover.”\nThe political fate of Lebanon has been up for grabs since the end of the civil war nearly 25 years ago, with Iran and Saudi Arabia joining France, the US, Syria and Turkey in trying to shape affairs. However, the main protagonists have long been Riyadh and Tehran, with the latter using Hezbollah to out-muscle the Saudis, who have wielded influence through financial patronage.\nHezbollah has consolidated its position since a brief war with Israel in 2006, and has grown stronger since the formation of Hariri’s government. The president was appointed after nearly two years without a head of state, with the agreement of both capitals. However, since then a political and institutional stalemate has festered.\n\n\n\n\nIran's president says Saudi Arabia behind 'hostility' in region\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore importantly, Iran has been expanding its influence in neighbouring states. In Syria it has defended the regime of Bashar al-Assad and, with Russia, helped his forces into a winning position on the battlefield against opposition groups and Islamic State.\nIran has also gained significant influence in Iraq since the US-led ousting of Saddam Hussein. It has moved into the post-Isis vacuum, reinforcing a physical corridor that it aims to complete from Tehran to the Syrian port city of Tartous. The Syrian-Iraqi border is an essential part of this plan, and the clearing of Deir ez-Zor, Mayadin and Bukamal in recent weeks are seen by Iranian officials as strategic steps.\nThe Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, accused Saudi officials of making a strategic mistake by considering the US and “the Zionist regime”, Iran’s terminology for Israel, as allies. He said the US and Israel were trying to dominate the region to “plunder its oil and wealth” and that Trump’s administration was “skilful in pickpocketing” Saudi Arabia.\nJoseph Bahout, a visiting scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said: “I couldn’t envisage this kind of Saudi show of force towards Iran and Hezbollah without some kind of US and Israeli blessing. I am convinced of this. There is something brewing. \n“But the Saudis often misread the signs they are given. Did they get a clear sign or a wink? – and can they tell the difference?”\n“Saudi Arabia and Israeli may be strategically aligned, but they’re not tactically aligned,” said Daniel Shapiro, former US ambassador to Israel and now a visiting fellow at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv.\n“MBS [Mohammed bin Salman] doesn’t do a lot of consulting, even with those who share his interests. He is an impatient man who wants others to respond to his moves rather than do strategic planning.”\nShapiro said that Prince Salman may be seeking to goad Hezbollah into a conflict but it was not clear how the group would respond, and Israel did not appear ready to pick a fight now either.\n“Israel has been preparing for the next war against Hezbollah for some time, but has sought to put it off as long as possible,” he said.\nThe White House, meanwhile, said: “We condemn the Iranian regime’s activities and stand with Saudi Arabia.” \n"

Two weeks ago Israeli warplanes struck a base associated with Syria’s chemical weapons production.\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors the civil war, said the attack earlier this month was on a facility of the Scientific Studies and Research Centre, an agency which the US describes as Syria’s chemical weapons manufacturer. \nAn Israeli military spokeswoman declined to comment on the reports of the airstrike, saying: “We do not respond to such reports.” \nIsrael, which fought a 2006 war with Hezbollah, sees red lines in the shipment to the powerful Shia group of anti-aircraft missiles, precision ground-to-ground missiles and chemical weapons.\n"

        "text": "\nIn secret service circles, he was either known as “Institution M” or “The Man with Nine Fingers”, because of a missing digit on his left hand. Locals in his village thought he was called “Richard Nelson” but his bank clerk knew him as “Claus Möllner”. Politicians at the top of government simply referred to their top secret agent as “007”.\nFor at least three decades Werner Mauss was Germany’s real-life answer to James Bond: a rogue operator who moved in the shadowy realm between criminal underworld and intelligence agencies, entrapping drug dealers, retrieving stolen goods, negotiating with terrorists, often changing identity on his private plane mid-air.\nBut now, at the end of a career of dodging bullets and speeding cars, the 77-year-old has been caught in the web of a more mundane nemesis: the taxman. \nOn Monday, Mauss will appear in a county court in Bochum for the closing argument of a trial in which he stands accused of evading €14m (£12.3m) in tax to help fund a lifestyle of fast cars and thoroughbred horses. If the state prosecution has its way, he could be sentenced to six years and three months in prison by the end of the week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  A sketch of Werner Mauss, printed in Der Spiegel in November 1985. Photograph: Der Spiegel\n\n\nBorn in 1940 in Essen, Mauss had discovered his talent for winning over the trust of strangers while working as a door-to-door vacuum cleaner sales rep. While still in his 20s, he started a detective agency which he ran with his first wife, spying first on cheating husbands and insurance scammers, then moving on to criminal gangs.\nMauss would pretend to be a dealer interested in buying stolen cars, furs or jewellery, and tip off the police once the thieves had confided in him the details of their next robbery. His method, he told journalist Stephan Lamby for a 1998 documentary, consisted of “leading the target through different psychological rooms” and then confronting them with intellectual challenges that forced them to reveal more than they intended.\nFrom 1970 to 1996, Mauss’s name was mentioned in connection with almost every major criminal case in West Germany: according to a biography by journalist Stefan Aust, he claimed to have orchestrated the arrest of no fewer than 162 diamond smugglers, burglars and drug dealers between June 1970 and May 1971 alone.\nIn 1976, Mauss personally arrested a member of leftwing terror group the Baader-Meinhof gang at a newsagent in Athens. In 1983, the government commissioned him directly to retrieve 41 barrels of toxic waste that had gone missing during transport, which the undercover detective promptly discovered on a farm in northern France.\nIn the late 1980s and 1990s, the self-made secret agent went global, negotiating with Hezbollah to free industrialists kidnapped in Lebanon, and trekking through the South American jungle to achieve the release of a German citizen held by ELN guerrillas.\nThe latter mission eventually led to Mauss’s unmasking by the Colombian government, which was concerned that he was collaborating with kidnappers to drive up the ransom money. After being sent to prison for nine months, he was cleared of charges in 1998.\nWith the double 0 lifestyle also came a suitably expensive taste: Swiss watches, fur coats, luxury hotels, Porsches, Jaguars and a Cessna 172, in which Mauss was able to fly directly to missions around the world from a runway on his 40,000 acre estate in the Hunsrück region in Germany’s southwest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Werner Mauss and his private plane Photograph: Süddeutsche Zeitung\n\n\nThe fenced-off property, which Mauss acquired at the end of the 1960s, has over years grown into what local newspaper Rhein-Zeitung calls a “Disney World castle”, complete with pagodas, a landscaped private zoo with mouflon, ibex, chamois, cranes and peacocks, and the biggest private riding hall in Germany.\nGermany’s state prosecutor believes Mauss has funded these expensive habits via two UBS offshore accounts in Luxembourg and the Bahamas, all while failing to pay tax on capital assets worth more than $50m (£36.8m) between 2002 and 2012 alone. One UBS manager interviewed by investigators said that Mauss had regularly travelled to Luxembourg to withdraw cash from his account, “around €300,000 per month”.\nGermany’s tax office had got wind of Mauss’s offshore activity after purchasing leaked Swiss bank data in 2012. Last year, daily Süddeutsche Zeitung discovered one of the special agent’s aliases in the Panama Papers leak and made the investigation public.\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the Panama Papers? A guide to history's biggest data leak\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMauss claims that he did not have to pay tax on the money in the UBS accounts because it had come from a trust fund set up by western intelligence agencies to support his “covert fight against crime and terrorism”.\nIn the year-long trial at Bochum county court, Mauss appeared on court days wearing a hooded jacket to shield himself from photographers, even though his website werner-mauss.de features a video clip in which he is clearly identifiable.\nThe 77-year-old has insisted that he continues his Bond-like activity to this day, in spite of his unmasking in 1996. Mauss not only cited operations in Iraq, Israel, Myanmar and Thailand but also claimed to be currently engaged in the “fight against Isis”. As recently as 2011, he told his investigators, the trust fund had enabled him to save Pope Benedict XVI from attempted poisoning by the Sicilian-Colombian drug mafia, thanks to a tip-off from the Chinese secret service.\nStar witnesses who Mauss had promised would confirm his version of events never materialised, however. One, a deputy of the Federal Police Agency, turned out to have died over five years ago. Neither could the secret agent explain to the prosecutor why foreign intelligence agencies would have set up a trust fund whose statutes stipulated that monies would be channelled towards the creation of a “Werner Mauss museum” after his death. His defence, said state prosecutor Timo Dörfer, had “trickled away like sand between his fingers”.\nOn Monday, Mauss’s team defence lawyer will get a final hearing, after which the judge Markus van den Hövel has 11 days to pass a sentence. .\n"

        "text": "\nThe Lebanese prime minister, Saad Hariri, has said he is suspending the resignation that he announced two weeks ago from Saudi Arabia, easing a crisis that had deepened tensions around the Middle East.\n“Our nation today needs at this sensitive time exceptional efforts from everyone to protect it against danger,” Hariri said during independence day celebrations, having returned to Beirut late on Tuesday. “We must dissociate from wars, external struggles and regional conflicts.”\nThe unusual nature of Hariri’s surprise resignation on 4 November prompted fears that he had been forced to leave office under the orders of his regional backers and that he had been held against his will in Saudi Arabia.\nIt came against the backdrop of a regional power tussle between the Saudis and Iran, and renewed Saudi condemnation of Hezbollah, Hariri’s partners in government. \nThe postponement of his resignation will offer a brief respite for the Lebanese, who are struggling with the spillover from the war in Syria, tensions arising from Hezbollah’s participation in the conflict alongside Bashar al-Assad, and a large refugee population in a country already riven by sectarian divisions.\nAfter his announcement, Hariri supporters marched through central Beirut, chanting “Saad” and waving the blue flag of his Future Movement political party.\nA convoy of honking cars, some painted blue and others plastered with pictures of Hariri, zipped through the streets. Hundreds also gathered at his house in Beirut, to welcome him back.\nLebanon’s president, Michel Aoun, had said he would not accept Hariri’s resignation unless he presented it in person, saying that he was acting on the assumption that Hariri had been forcibly kept in Riyadh.\nThe crisis had threatened to splinter Hariri’s support base and plunge Lebanon, long a battleground for larger regional powers, into turmoil. France, which had a former mandate power over Lebanon, also intervened, with President Emmanuel Macron holding talks in Riyadh with the Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman and later inviting Hariri to the Élysée Palace.\nThe Lebanese PM eventually conducted a whirlwind tour of Paris, Cairo and Cyprus before landing in Beirut just before midnight on Tuesday, amid breathless coverage from Lebanese media outlets.\nOn Wednesday, Hariri said he presented his resignation to Aoun at the presidential palace, but then responded to Aoun’s request to take more time for consultations, “hoping it will constitute a serious introduction for [national] dialogue”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Supporters of Saad Hariri wave the Lebanese flag alongside the Saudi and Future Movement flags as they gather at his home in Beirut on Wednesday Photograph: Marwan Tahtah/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\nHe reiterated the need for Lebanon to remain neutral on regional disputes and conflicts “and all that undermines internal stability and brotherly relations with Arab brothers”.\nTop Lebanese officials had accused Hariri’s patron, Saudi Arabia, of forcing his resignation and detaining him in the kingdom for days. The Lebanese rallied around Hariri, unanimously calling for his return from Saudi Arabia in what became an embarrassment to the kingdom.\nHariri had said he was resigning due to Hezbollah and Iran’s domination over Lebanon and because of alleged threats to his life. His father, Rafik, was assassinated in 2005 in downtown Beirut in a massive bombing, and an international tribunal indicted five members of Hezbollah in connection with the case.\nHariri’s announcement suggests that Saudi Arabia’s young crown prince realised he had overreached by firing Hariri, which constituted another failed move to try to counter Iran. \n\n\n\n\nSaudi arrests show crown prince is a risk-taker with a zeal for reform\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHis resignation was followed by a steep escalation in Saudi statements against the Lebanese government, which includes Hezbollah. Riyadh said the Lebanese government as a whole, not just Hezbollah, had declared war against it. \nWestern governments including the US struck a different tone, affirming their support for Hariri and Lebanon and the stability of the country, which is hosting 1.5 million Syrian refugees – nearly one in four of the Lebanese population. \n\n"

        "text": "\nMore than 3,000 refugees and militants have crossed the Lebanese border into Syria in the second phase of a repatriation that aid groups say lacks transparency and offers few guarantees about the returnees’ welfare.\nThe returnees, among them up to 350 militants who had lived near the Lebanese border town of Arsal, were escorted on Monday by Hezbollah, the powerful armed group based in Lebanon, to nearby towns in Syria’s Qalamoun region. It followed a transfer earlier this month of more than 7,000 refugees, fighters and their families to Idlib province in northern Syria, which is largely controlled by al-Qaida-inspired groups.\nThe UN played no role in either repatriation and has cautioned that the conditions for safe return have not been met. Although they have been cast as voluntary, some senior UN officials believe many of those who have crossed into Syria have had little choice in their departure and that the move has been contrived to suit political ends.\n\n\n\n\nSyria's White Helmets protest against killings of rescue workers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArsal had been a focal point of clashes between the al-Qaida-inspired Hayat Tahrir al-Sham – formerly known as Jabhat Fateh al-Sham and Jabhat al-Nusra – and Hezbollah over the past 18 months, and Lebanese leaders had frequently claimed that extremists based there amid an estimated 100,000 refugees had created a lawless enclave to terrorise locals and menace Lebanon.\nBut more recently, the fate of the besieged town had become central to a broader debate over how to deal with the millions of Syrians displaced into Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey by Syria’s seven-year war.\nThe removal has come against a backdrop of increasingly strident rhetoric against refugees in Lebanon, with some of the discourse driven by politicians whose fates are tied to the fortunes of the Syrian leader, Bashar al-Assad.\nMore than 1 million Syrians are registered with the United Nations high commissioner for refugees (UNHCR) in the Lebanese capital, but at least another 500,000 are thought to be scattered throughout the country. An extensive aid programme has largely covered the cost of the influx.\n\nMap\n\nSyrians in Beirut have increasingly claimed that the government is attempting to push them back to Syria, where the Assad regime has gradually clawed back control over many parts of the country, with extensive backing from Iran and Russia.\nDespite a slowdown in the fighting, much of Syria remains ravaged by war and refugees have expressed fears that they would be vulnerable to persecution if they returned. “The pressure to leave is mounting,” said Nabil al-Homsi, a long-term refugee in Lebanon. “They want us to pretend that everything is OK [in Syria], that we are more vulnerable here than we would be there. The Lebanese don’t want us. It’s an uncomfortable time.”\nAid groups say there is increasing concern that extensive refugee populations in Lebanon and Turkey are also being pressured to consider returning to Syria. NGOs working on Syria issues in Turkey say they have found it increasingly difficult to renew work permits or to conduct cross-border work. “There is a clear push to make us go away,” said one senior official. “The refugee issue is politically more difficult for [the Turkish government] than it has been. And they are passing that down to us.”\nWhile Ankara has not struck a rapprochement with Assad, the government of Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has told Russia and other allies that the survival of the Syrian leader has become a political reality. A strident opponent of the Assad regime for the first five years of the war, Turkey has since framed its interests through the prism of stymying Kurdish ambitions, and countering the threat from Islamic State. It still supports a refugee population of more than 2 million, but its borders with Syria have been closed to civilians fleeing the conflict for much of the past two years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Vehicles make their way through Lebanon as part of the repatriation. Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\n\nBassam Khawaja, a Lebanon researcher for Human Rights Watch, said: “We’re very concerned about the lack of safeguards or any process in place to ensure that these returns are completely voluntary. Any forced or coerced returns would be a violation of Lebanon’s obligations under international law.”\nThe returnees who departed on Monday arrived late in the day at three towns close to Damascus, where they have received offers of amnesty. Some of those who left said they feared they would be sent further, to Idlib, where refugees who departed Arsal a fortnight ago are still settling in.\n“I worked as a doctor in Arsal at the Central hospital and at the Islamic hospital,” said Dr Hassan Ammar, 24. “It was a mistake coming here to Idlib, there is no work. I lost everything and the ride in the bus was from hell. Jabhat al-Nusra was the main opposition group operating in Arsal, we were almost separated, it was like the civilians alone and the militants alone. They didn’t really protect us from the menace of the Lebanese army and Hezbollah. They had their own backs to watch after.\n“So I am here in Idlib now, miserable, but at least we have fresh vegetables and can roam around without feeling targeted. Hezbollah is stronger than both the Syrian and the Lebanese army. I was there for about five years, it felt like everything was under their control, no one else’s.”\nA second new arrival, Diab Hussain al-Zaitoun, 27, said: “I had to leave Arsal, conditions were horrific. What can I tell you? I am at a loss for words … I feel relatively safer here although we don’t know if we might be bombed into pieces at any given time – it’s an unknown type of safety. I don’t have a job here. But anything beats being in Arsal surrounded by the thugs.”\n"

        "text": "\nIn Beirut’s southern suburbs, where buildings scarred with wars of old blend with posters of the latest dead, talk of another conflict has taken hold. A fight on a scale not seen before may be brewing, say locals like Hussein Khaireddine, a barber who says he and his family in the Shia suburb of Dahiyeh have grown used to tensions over decades.\n“This one’s different,” he said. “It could lead to every valley and mountain top. And if it starts, it may not stop.”\nThe trepidation extends beyond the city’s predominantly Shia suburbs and south Lebanon, which bore the brunt of the 2006 war with Israel, to all corners of a country that has suddenly found itself at the centre of an extraordinary regional crisis. The turmoil had been brewing for years. But it was brought to a head on 3 November, at a lunch in Beirut being hosted by prime minister Saad Hariri. Midway through the meal with the visiting French cultural minister, Françoise Nyssen, Hariri received a call and his demeanour changed. He excused himself and left for the airport, without his aides.\nWithin hours Hariri, by then in Riyadh in Saudi Arabia, had resigned his position, concluding his transition from Lebanese leader to Saudi envoy and Lebanon’s transformation from outpost to ground zero of a stunning regional escalation.\nThe aftermath of the hurried departure, and the heated week since, has swept across the region, linking apparently disparate events which, in reality, were symptoms of political undercurrents that had been coursing through the Middle East for generations, and which have now burst to the surface.\nThe fall of Kurdish-held Kirkuk in northern Iraq to the Iraqi government, backed by Iran’s most prominent general, in October, starvation among the population of war-torn Yemen, a ballistic missile over Riyadh, and the apparently forced exit of the premier in Lebanon are all part of the same machinations – a great strategic power play between two regional heavyweights that has suddenly shifted from back rooms to potent realisation.\nNow, more than at any point in modern history, Iran and Saudi Arabia are squared off against each other as a race to consolidate influence nears a climax from Sana’a to Beirut.\nThe standoff is seeing new ground conquered, previously unimaginable alliances being mooted and the risk of a devastating clash between two foes whose calculations had long been that shadow wars through proxies were safer than facing up directly.\nThe shift in approach has been led from Riyadh, where a new regime determined to put Saudi Arabia on an entirely different footing domestically, is also trying to overhaul how the kingdom projects itself regionally – and globally.\nThe ambitious, unusually powerful, crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, has been given a mandate by his father, King Salman, to take on what the kingdom and its allies in the United Arab Emirates see as an Iranian takeover of essential corners of the Sunni Arab world.\nHis role on the home front, meanwhile, appears to have few bounds. Cultural reforms, economic rehabilitation, overturning traditional forms of governance, and a corruption purge that has dragged in previously immune royal billionaires, have left Saudi society reeling.\nSix months into his job, Prince Mohammed, and the UAE’s crown prince, Mohammed bin Zayed, believe that the time has come to muscle up to Iran. Both insist that Iran’s arc of influence has conquered Baghdad, Damascus, Gaza and Lebanon, and is making inroads into Yemen and Manama, with the city states of Abu Dhabi and Dubai also within reach.\nAs Hariri settled back into Riyadh, the Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas – whose administration last month reconciled with Hamas, which has received support from Iran – was also summonsed to Riyadh to meet King Salman.\n“Where this story starts depends on your vantage point,” said a European diplomat who has spent more than 20 years in the region. “To the Saudis, it’s the Islamic Revolution of 1979. They say that forced them to behave abnormally, and that now things are reverting to their old ways. There is truth to that, but there is just as much truth in suggesting 2003 kicked things off. Some of the Iranians at the pointy end of this, meanwhile, might go back another 1,500 years.”\nThe foundational split between the two main sects of Islam, over whether followers or descendants should succeed the Prophet Mohammed, has long been a starting point for attempts to explain the contemporary rivalry between Tehran and Riyadh. But the contest has more recently been drawn along modern lines of political power and influence, particularly in the post-Saddam years, which left the centre of the region deeply destabilised. “Saddam was the Sunni bulwark,” said a Lebanese politician who advised the former Iraqi dictator. “That is only now being understood by the Saudis, who are trying to position themselves in his wake, all these years later.”\n“While they dithered, Iran took hold,” said a senior Saudi official who has left the kingdom in the past year. “While they thought the US was doing their bidding, it was actually enabling an Iranian takeover. This is now almost complete. So they are right to worry. So is everyone. Things have changed in the Middle East by them doing nothing about it.”\nIn the past year, as its forces have propped up Bashar al-Assad’s army in Syria, and allied with the Iraqi army and paramilitaries fighting with it, Iran has played a leading role in the imminent military defeat of the Islamic State (Isis). It has done so mainly through the use of proxies, which have played essential roles in most battles – including the Iraqi recapture of Kirkuk – and have helped clear land across central Iraq and much of Syria that has become strategically vital.\nIran now all but controls a land corridor that runs from Tehran to Tartous in Syria, on the Mediterranean coast, giving it access to a seaport a long way to its west, and far from the heavily patrolled waters of the Gulf. The route passes through the centre of Iraq, and Syria, skirting the Lebanese border and what were some of the most active areas of the Syrian civil war, which have been returned to regime control. “They are two months from finishing this,” said a senior regional intelligence official. “This changes things. It gives them an open supply line to move whatever they want. And it gives them strategic depth. It is a big deal.”\nAmong all its proxies, Hezbollah in Lebanon has been the most valuable – and potent. Hezbollah is the arrowhead of Iran’s projection against Israel, and it has drawn heavily on its battle-hardened members and leaders in other regional conflicts – Syria especially, where the group has suffered at least 1,500 casualties – as well as Iraq and Yemen.\nThe Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, has taken an active interest in the Saudi war in Yemen, which has pitched the kingdom’s US-armed military against Houthis, who are at least partly backed by Iran. Riyadh believes that Hezbollah members have been instrumental in arming and training the Houthis, and claims that a ballistic missile that was shot down over Riyadh airport on the night that Hariri quit, was helped on its way by Hezbollah members.\nSaudi leaders had long placed faith in Hariri as their man to defy Hezbollah and assert the authority of state institutions over its parallel political and military structure in Lebanon.\nTheir patience ran out last year when the Saudi construction sector collapsed, dragging down with it a company that Hariri chaired. Since then, he and Saudi leaders have been at odds over more than $1 billion. Riyadh’s new sense of crisis appears to have put that feud on hold and invited Hariri back into the fold – for a price.\n“That the Saudi leadership ever could have seriously entertained the notion that Hariri could “rein in” Hezbollah appears fanciful if one takes even a cursory look at the group’s relationship to Lebanese governments since 2005, which it either dominated, defied or toppled at will,” said Heiko Wimmen, project director for Iraq, Syria and Lebanon for the International Crisis Group.\n“Nor is it plausible to assume Hariri’s resignation would compel Hezbollah to change its ways. No government can be formed without its consent.”\n"

        "text": "\nIsraeli jets have attacked a Syrian government anti-aircraft missile launcher after it fired on its aircraft patrolling in Lebanese air space on a photographic reconnaissance mission, the Israeli military said.\nThe incident occurred on Monday morning, according to an Israeli military spokesman, who said it was the first time Israeli aircraft had been targeted by Syrian forces while flying over Lebanon since the Syrian war began.\nHe added that the aircraft were flying inside Lebanon but close to the Syrian border when the missile was fired at them.\nAccording to the spokesman, the missile – an SA5 surface-to-air rocket – failed to hit its target, and the anti-aircraft battery located 30 miles from Damascus was then hit by separate Israeli jets, “incapacitating” the launcher with four strikes. \nThere was no information on any casualties.\nThe missile launch is the second time this year Israeli jets have been engaged by Syrian anti-aircraft missiles, with the rocket fired in the previous incident flying into Israel. According to Israel, the same battery that fired on Monday was also involved in that incident.\nThe exchange of fire came as Sergei Shoigu, the defence minister of Russia – a key ally of Bashar al-Assad’s Syrian regime – was due to arrive in Israel for talks with the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.\nNetanyahu and other senior Israeli officials are said to want to raise the issue of what they claim is Iran’s growing presence in Syria as well as weapons transfers by Tehran to the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah, a key ally of the Assad regime.\nThe Israeli military said Russia was informed in “real time” about the incident and the subsequent retaliation in line with an Israeli-Russian arrangement.\n“The Syrian regime is responsible for any firing from its territory. We see this incident as a clear provocation and we will not allow it.\n If anti-aircraft fire is being carried out for any military activity, we will respond as we did now,” said the Israeli military spokesman.\nThe Israeli admission that it carried out the strikes on the launcher is unusual in that it rarely comments on operations in Syria, where it has reportedly carried out hundreds of strikes against targets associated with Hezbollah, which has been fighting for the Assad regime.\nIn September, the Israeli military hit a base in Syria that has been associated with the Assad regime’s chemical weapons infrastructure and where Hezbollah reportedly stored missiles.\n• This article was amended on 17 October 2017.

A Syrian military statement appears to confirm the reports.\nThe airstrike on the Syrian Scientific Studies and Research Centre was reported to have taken place overnight. Western intelligence reports have linked the centre near the town of Masyaf to Syria’s chemical weapons programme.\nA statement from the Syrian military said the attack had occurred early on Thursday and hit a facility close to the Mediterranean coast. It said Israeli warplanes fired several missiles after entering neighbouring Lebanon’s air space.\n\n\n\n\nSyrian regime dropped sarin on rebel-held town in April, UN confirms\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Israeli warplanes at 2.42am fired a number of missiles from Lebanese air space, targeting one of our military positions near Masyaf, which led to material damage and the deaths of two members of the site,” the army said in a statement.\nIt warned of the “dangerous repercussions of such hostile acts on the security and stability of the region”.\nSyrian opposition sources said four Israeli warplanes were involved in the strike. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, along with others, identified the target as the al-Talai facility, a site that had been subject to US sanctions for its role in the Syrian non-conventional weapons agency.\nThe strikes follow a series of statements by Israel in recent weeks accusing Iran of seeking to establish itself in Syria and Lebanon and of building a weapons factory, as the six-year Syrian civil war has continued to swing in favour of Assad.\nIsrael rarely confirms its strikes inside Syria but it has launched numerous strikes during the country’s civil war, usually against arms convoys and weapons storage sites associated with Hezbollah, a key Assad ally.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Israeli armed forces take part in their largest military drill in 19 years. Photograph: Atef Safadi/EPA\n\n\nAn Israeli army spokeswoman declined to discuss reports of a strike in Syria, but Amos Yadlin, a former head of Israeli military intelligence, tweeted that the reported attack was not routine and targeted a Syrian military scientific centre.\n“The facility at Masyaf also produces chemical weapons and explosive barrels that have killed thousands of Syrian civilians,” he said. \nAmir Eshel, a former Israeli air force chief, suggested in August that Israel had conducted dozens of airstrikes on weapons convoys destined for the Hezbollah over the past five years.\nWashington claims the al-Talai centre developed the sarin gas weapon allegedly used in a chemical attack on the Syrian town of Khan Sheikhun in April, which left about 80 people dead.\nUN war crimes investigators announced on Wednesday they had an “extensive body of information” that indicated Syrian warplanes were behind the attack.\nIn a conference call with journalists, the former Israeli national security adviser Yaakov Amidror said the fact that the target was a Syrian military facility took Israeli intervention to a new level.\n“I know the organisation and facility,” he said. “For many years it has been one of the Syrian centres for research and development for weapons systems including chemical weapons … and weapons that have been transferred to Hezbollah.”\nThe only logical explanation for the attack was that the facility was producing weapons systems for Hezbollah, he said.\nEven before the outbreak of the war in Syria, the al-Talai centre was on Israel’s radar. The director of the Israeli national security council’s counter-terrorism bureau called for the destruction of the centre in 2010, alleging it had provided weapons to Hezbollah and Hamas.\nIsrael is conducting its biggest military exercise in 19 years on its northern border, involving tens of thousands of troops. It has been widely described as a dress rehearsal for a future war with Hezbollah, including civilian evacuation drills.\nThe strike, if confirmed, follows increasingly bellicose statements from senior Israeli government officials, including the country’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, about the advances Assad has made in the civil war, backed by Iran, Hezbollah and Russia.\nNetanyahu accused Iran last week of building sites to produce precision-guided missiles in Syria and Lebanon, but the commentator Amos Harel suggested in Haaretz that the Israeli action may have been a message aimed as much at Washington and Moscow as Tehran and Hezbollah after Israeli disquiet over a Russian-backed partial ceasefire in Syria.\n“The United States, whose interest in Syria has been on the decline, acceded to the Russian initiative. Washington and Moscow also failed to heed Israeli protests that the agreement to reduce friction in southern Syria failed to require Iran and allied militias to steer clear of the Golan Heights,” he wrote.\n"

        "text": "\nIsrael’s military chief has given an “unprecedented” interview to a Saudi newspaper underlining the ways in which the two countries could unite to counter Iran’s influence in the region.\nSpeaking to the Saudi newspaper Elaph, Gen Gadi Eisenkot described Iran as the “biggest threat to the region” and said Israel would be prepared to share intelligence with “moderate” Arab states like Saudi Arabia in order to “deal with” Tehran.\nThe interview, however, is particularly striking in its very public and confrontational messaging: an appeal by Israel to Riyadh for a joint action on Tehran, delivered by Israel’s most senior soldier. \nIt is the latest dramatic twist in weeks of turmoil in the region, which followed an unexpected purge of Saudi princes and officials by crown prince Mohammad bin Salman, who has also increasingly locked Saudi Arabia on a path to confrontation with Iran.\nWhile Israel and Saudi Arabia do not have diplomatic relations, they have been edging closer recently, including a visit last year by a retired Saudi general heading a delegation seeking to encourage better relations. \n\n\n\n\nI will return Saudi Arabia to moderate Islam, says crown prince\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEisenkot told Elaph that the two countries agree about Iran’s intentions and that Israel is increasingly “highly regarded by the moderate countries in the region”. Asked about Israeli intelligence sharing with Saudi Arabia, he insisted: “We are prepared to share information if it is necessary. There are many mutual interests between them [Saudi Arabia] and us.”\nThe interview – described by the Israeli newspaper Haaretz as “unprecedented” – would have required Israeli political approval at the highest level, given the lack of diplomatic relations with Saudi Arabia. It is significant for its intended symbolism, designed to show off a warmer relationship with Riyadh in public, not least the emerging US-backed axis against Iran. \n“There’s an opportunity to form a new international coalition in the region with President Trump,” Eisenkot added. “We need to carry out a large, comprehensive strategic plan to stop the Iranian threat.”\nLast week Saudi Arabia ordered its citizens to leave Lebanon immediately, escalating a regional standoff with Iran centred on the fragile state, which it claims is being run by Tehran’s proxy, Hezbollah. The move followed the unexpected resignation of Lebanon’s prime minister, Saad Hariri, citing Iranian influence across the region and claiming he feared for his safety.\nTensions have also been rising over the conflict in Yemen, where a Saudi-led coalition is fighting against Iranian-backed Houthi rebels.\nEchoing the recent rhetoric of Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Eisenkot charged Iran with “seeking to take control of the Middle East creating a [Shia] crescent from Lebanon to Iran and then from the Gulf to the Red Sea,” adding that “we must prevent this from happening”.\n“In this matter there is complete agreement between us and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which has never been our enemy. It has not fought us nor have we fought it.\n“When I was at a meeting of the [US] joint chiefs of staff in Washington and heard what the Saudi representative had to say, I found it identical to what I think in the need to confront Iran and its expansion in the region.”\nEisenkot added that at present Israel has no intention of attacking the Iranian-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon. “We have no intention of attacking Hezbollah in Lebanon leading to a war,” he told the paper. “However we will not accept a strategic threat to Israel.”\n"

We do not say that lightly. We mean what we say and we back it with action.”\nIsrael has already bombed what it regards as Hezbollah bases inside Syria in the belief arms were being smuggled in that may pose a threat to Israel. It was reported on Wednesday that Israeli jets targeted a weapons depot situated in rural areas around Hisya, south of the Syrian city of Homs.\nBut Netanyahu’s latest, more comprehensive message about Iranian intentions in Syria suggest Israel is prepared to set wider red lines and prepare for a deeper confrontation with Iran to ensure it is not a beneficiary of any end to the civil war in Syria.\nIran, he said, citing the veteran American diplomat Henry Kissinger, “is a cause not a country”. He said it “was devouring one nation after another either directly or by proxy” and, in Syria, had imported tens of thousands of shia militia fighters.\nHe said a “dramatic shift” in Israeli-Arab relations was under way, leading to an understanding with moderate authoritarian states opposed to Iran. “The good guys are getting together with Israel in a new way, forming an effective alliance to counter the aggression of Iran. It has a great promise of peace,” he said.\n“It used to be said if you make peace with the Palestinians you make peace with the rest of the Arab world. It may as well be that if you make peace with the Arab world you make peace with the Palestinians.”\nHe claimed attitudes to Israel were mellowing not just among the elites in the Arab world, but across Arab social media.\nSpeaking in the midst of the commemoration of the centenary of the Balfour Declaration, Netanyahu also welcomed the Trump administration’s approach to seeking peace between Israeli and the Palestinians, but hinted at his doubts about the US team, saying: “To think out of the box, you have to know the box.” \nHe also suggested strict limits on any sovereignty for a future Palestinian state saying: “I think it is time we reassess the model of sovereignty and whether that is applicable everywhere in the world.”\n\n\n\n\nIsrael: 'We have shot down Iranian-supplied Hezbollah drone'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe implied there would be no peace settlement that left Palestine in charge of its own security, saying he was prepared to “trade land for peace, but not land for rockets which was all that had happened in the past”. Palestinians could have the power to govern themselves but not to threaten others, he said.\nAlthough he repeatedly denounced Iran as a medieval state and warned Israel will not allow Iran to develop a bomb, he stressed he was not necessarily seeing the Iran nuclear deal as jettisoned in its entirety, but instead reshaped. He said he had not called for the deal necessarily to be nixed, a position he believes EU powers have not fully understood.\nThe required changes include the issues of inspections on military sites, “sunset clauses” and the portion of the agreement allowing Iran’s ability to enrich uranium and develop centrifuges, which automatically expires after a set time.\nThe problem with the deal, Netanyahu said, is that if Iran does nothing and keeps to the agreement, it will be able to produce nuclear weapons within seconds of the agreement expiring, he claimed.\nThey could break out to multiple bombs within seconds of the deal ending, he said. \n"

        "text": "\nHezbollah has claimed its top military commander died as a result of artillery shelling by Islamists near Damascus airport this week – despite his death being initially linked to Israel.\nThe Lebanese Shia Muslim group announced Mustafa Badreddine’s death on Friday and a military funeral was held for him on the same day in the group’s stronghold in southern Beirut.\nHis death was originally linked to Israel, Hezbollah’s primary enemy, but the group claimed on Saturday the attack was launched by “takfiri groups” – a word used to refer to Sunni Islamist groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n \nThousands mourn top Hezbollah commander killed in Syria\n\n\nA statement said: “Investigations have showed that the explosion, which targeted one of our bases near Damascus international airport, and which led to the martyrdom of commander Mustafa Badreddine, was the result of artillery bombardment carried out by takfiri groups in the area.”\nThe statement continued: “The result of the investigation will increase our commitment and will and perseverance in continuing to battle these criminal gangs and defeat them, and this was the wish of our dear martyr Sayyed Zul Fikar [Badreddine’s nom de guerre] and his will to his mujahideen brothers.” \nHowever, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said later on Saturday that there has been no rebel shelling of the Damascus airport area in the last few days, casting doubt on Hezbollah’s allocation of blame.\nBlaming the attack that killed Badreddine on the rebels will have come as a major cause of relief for many in Lebanon and Israel. If the group had blamed Israel for the attack, it would have been obliged to respond in kind.\nHezbollah has still not avenged the assassination of its former military commander Imad Mughniyeh in a joint CIA-Mossad operation in the heart of Damascus in 2008, and blaming Badreddine’s death on the Israelis would have further highlighted the party’s inability to level retribution for the killings of its leaders. \nThat is one of the reasons why accusing Syrian rebels has been treated with scepticism. Hezbollah has sought to equate its fight against the Sunni-dominated opposition in Syria with its fight against Israel, as the party lost its former popularity fighting alongside the regime of Bashar al-Assad.\n\n\n\n\nMustafa Badreddine: the Hezbollah leader who left no footprints\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThose who had once saluted its fight against Israel have begun to see Hezbollah as another sectarian militia in the Syrian quagmire. Its statement on Saturday reaffirmed that claim, equating the takfiris in Syria with its arch-enemy Israel, and the US.\nHezbollah initially said it was intervening in Syria to protect Shia shrines, before moving on to claim that its intervention saved Lebanon from an influx of jihadis from Syria. Now it claims it is fighting to protect the Muslim world from extremists as well as Israel, which in their messaging are two sides of the same coin.\nBadreddine was the most senior member of the organisation to have been killed since the death of his predecessor and brother-in-law, Mughniyeh, who was assassinated by a joint Mossad/CIA operation in the Syrian capital in February 2008.\nHe was born in 1961 in the southern Beirut suburb of Ghobeiry, and rose to greater prominence after Mughniyeh’s assassination. In the 1980s Badreddine was sentenced to death in Kuwait over a plot to blow up the American and French embassies and later escaped after Saddam Hussein’s army invaded the country and threw open its prisons.\nHezbollah claimed the military commander had gone on to be instrumental in the majority of the group’s activities since its inception. He and four other alleged members of Hezbollah remain on trial in absentia at The Hague.\nIn south Beirut posters of Badreddine, whose image has rarely been published, were hung from overpasses and lamp-posts following reports of his death. \n"

If true, they would illustrate how brazen the couple were in demanding favours.\nAccording to the reports, first carried by Israel’s Channel 2 and Channel 10 on Monday night, Hadas Klein, an assistant to both Packer and Milchan, has given evidence describing how the Netanyahus would routinely call demanding cigars, champagne and even that the bill be paid for a building inspector.\nWhile the Israeli prime minister has repeatedly denied the items represented anything more than goodwill between friends, the leak suggests that the Netanyahus always initiated the favours. \n“There was an understanding that Arnon had to supply the Netanyahus with whatever they want,” Klein reportedly told police, describing how a driver was employed to deliver the cigars and champagne to Jerusalem.\nAccording to Klein, the demands extended to services as well. “Sara would yell at me,” Klein reportedly said. “[She] wanted a building inspector who worked with Packer and Milchan to come consult with professionals from the prime minister’s office about leakage in the official residence. \n“I didn’t OK it, and then she yelled that I and Milchan were humiliating her and Bibi [Benjamin Netanyahu’s nickname], that we weren’t approving things … Bibi called himself and said it wasn’t right ... that they need to understand what she’s going through with the media [which the Netanyahus accuse of persecution], and that they had gotten legal advice and it’s all permissible.”\nThe evidence reportedly supplied by Klein relates to the so-called “gifts affair”, also known as case 1,000, one of two criminal investigations into the Israeli prime minister. Police questioned him for a fifth time last week. \nNetanyahu has repeatedly said the investigations “will produce nothing because there was nothing”.\nResponding to the latest leak, a spokesman for Netanyahu said: “The plague of fake news continues. What is being attributed to the prime minister and his wife is incorrect. The prime minister and his wife acted lawfully, so there will be nothing.”\nNeither Milchan nor Packer have responded to the alleged testimony, but in September it was reported that Milchan had denied giving gifts as part of any quid pro quo.\n"

        "text": "\nLike birds of prey circling high in the desert sky, Iran’s many foes and rivals are watching the street protests in Tehran and other cities with beady-eyed anticipation.\nHopes that the unrest could trigger regime collapse, voiced openly in the US and Israel, appear premature. But any real or imagined weakening of the Iranian government’s grip could presage a dangerous escalation of regional tensions. \nPredominantly Shia Muslim Iran’s efforts to project its power across the Middle East have earned it many enemies. Its expansionist policy gathered pace after the strategic cuffs came off at the end of the cold war, and accelerated following the British-American debacle in Iraq after 2003. \nIran is now a leading actor in post-Saddam Iraq, Syria and Lebanon. These perceived encroachments are a cause of great resentment, not only in Iraq’s Sunni heartlands to the north and west of Baghdad but especially in the headquarters of Sunni Islam, Saudi Arabia.\nIranian officials have already accused the Saudis of fomenting the protests. When Lorestan’s deputy governor blamed “takfiri groups” (Sunni extremists) and “foreign intelligence services”, he was using code for Riyadh. \nUntil recently, the idea that Saudi Arabia was secretly plotting regime change in Iran might have seemed outlandish. But tensions between the two countries are at an all-time high.\nThe Saudis accused Iran of direct responsibility for a recent missile attack on the king’s royal palace in Riyadh. The missile was launched from Yemen, where a Saudi-led coalition is fighting Houthi rebels backed by Tehran. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, has the backing of Donald Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Photograph: Bandar Algaloud/Courtesy of Saudi Royal Court via Reuters\n\n\nThe rivalry extends to Lebanon, where the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, mounted what most observers concluded was a bungled coup in November to reduce the influence of Tehran-backed Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shia political party and militia. \nIn his drive to repulse Iran, knock Qatar and other Arab Gulf states into line, and assert control at home, the youthful Salman has gained a reputation for recklessness. Nobody truly knows how far Salman is prepared to go, although he has vowed in the past “to take the fight to Iran” and has described Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, as “the new Hitler of the Middle East”. \n\n\n\n\n \n\nWhat is a surprise is the sudden eruption of the protests, which had no obvious internal trigger\n\n\nSalman has attracted an enthusiastic informal following and a spoof video depicting a Saudi military conquest of Iran recently went viral.\nSalman has the strong backing of his friend Jared Kushner, Donald Trump’s son-in-law and Middle East envoy. Trump’s hostility towards what he calls Iran’s “rogue regime”, and his wish to see it toppled, are no secret. \nWhat is a surprise is the sudden eruption of the protests, which had no obvious internal trigger. Trump and Mike Pence, his vice-president, voiced hopes Iran’s “oppressive regime” would fall, ignoring the fact that Hassan Rouhani was democratically re-elected as president less than one year ago. \nIsraeli politicians are also excited about regime change in Iran. The regional cooperation minister, Tzachi Hanegbi, said Iranian protesters were “courageously risking their lives in the pursuit of freedom”, and called on the “civilised world” to support them.\nBut Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, who has built a career demonising Iran as an existential threat, urged them to pipe down – presumably concerned that Iran’s leaders could turn their wrath on Israel. If Netanyahu fears a backlash, he is probably wise to do so. Unlike Trump and Pence, Israel is in the firing line if matters get out of hand. \nIsrael says Iran has stepped up missile and weapon supplies to Hezbollah in Lebanon and to Palestinian militants in Gaza. It is increasingly worried about the security of its de facto Golan Heights border with Syria. A weakened, wounded Iran could lash out. It could also prove a disruptive, unpredictable partner for both Iraq and Syria, as well as for Turkey and Russia, currently Tehran’s allies of convenience. \nAs for the circling American, Saudi and Israeli hawks, they should be careful what they wish for.\n"

        "text": "\nJeremy Corbyn has told MPs investigating accusations of antisemitism in the Labour party that he regrets once calling members of Hamas and Hezbollah “friends”.\nGiving evidence at the home affairs select committee on Monday, the Labour leader said that he had used the phrase to describe the militant groups during a meeting in parliament in 2009.\n“The language I used at that meeting was actually here in parliament and it was about encouraging the meeting to go ahead, encouraging there to be a discussion about the peace process,” he said.\n\n\n\n\nInside Momentum: ‘The idea that we’re all rulebook-thumping Trotskyites is silly’\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsked whether he still regarded Hamas and Hezbollah as “friends”, the Labour leader said: “No. It was inclusive language I used which with hindsight I would rather not have used. I regret using those words, of course.”\nHis comments came during the committee hearing into antisemitism within the party. Allegations of prejudice against Jewish people by Ken Livingstone, an MP and several ordinary members have been raised over the past eight months.\nCorbyn also expressed regret at his choice of words at a press conference launching an internal party report into antisemitism last week, which led to disputed claims he was drawing a parallel between Israel and Islamic State. \n Corbyn told the event last week that Jews were “no more responsible for the actions of Israel” than Muslims were for the “various self-styled Islamic states or organisations”. Corbyn had intended to refer to states of an Islamic character, giving the examples of Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Iran or Hamas in Gaza.\nAt the select committee, Corbyn said: “It would have been better, with hindsight – and many things are much better with hindsight, as every one of us around this table is well aware – if I had said Islamic countries rather than states.” \nLabour’s leader also clashed with one of his own MPs over claims the grassroots group Momentum has hounded those who have tried to raise the subject within the party. Chuka Umunna challenged Corbyn about the activities of Momentum, calling them a “party within a party”. Umunna said he was drawing a “direct correlation and line of causation between some of the acts of antisemitism we have seen in the Labour party and the activities of Momentum”. \nHe added: “One of the things I have found most insulting about this issue of antisemitism in our party is the suggestion that I or any other member of our party has raised this issue because we are somehow disgruntled, careerist Blairites.” \nCorbyn replied that the Momentum leader, Jon Lansman, had been “very firm” on issues of antisemitism and racism. “Momentum is a place where many people who have come into political activity for the first time, or returned to political activity, are activating themselves on housing issues, on transport issues, on wage issues, and many, many other issues. Surely that degree of engagement in political activity is a good thing?” Corbyn said.\n\n\n\n\nThis antisemitism report deserves Labour’s calm, close attention. No chance | Keith Kahn-Harris\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Nobody should be criticised for raising concerns about racism at any time or in any forum,” he added. \nAsked about Livingstone’s claim that Hitler supported Zionism, Corbyn told MPs: “Ken Livingstone made remarks that are wholly unacceptable and wrong.” \nCorbyn told the committee he was alarmed at reports of antisemitic comments made by Labour members since his election as leader in 2015. He said that appropriate action had been taken by the party’s compliance unit and fewer than 20 activists had been suspended while their cases were investigated.\nAsked if he had ever witnessed antisemitism during his time in the party, Corbyn said he had, but that it was a long time ago and not in his constituency of Islington North. He said he was “content” at the reinstatement as a Labour member of the vice-chair of Momentum, Jackie Walker, who was suspended earlier this year after saying Jews were the “chief financiers of the slave trade”.\n“Jackie Walker is a woman of black Jamaican heritage and European Jewish heritage,” he said. “I think she is somebody that does have a deep understanding of issues of racism that have affected her and her family in her life.” \nTory former minister Tim Loughton challenged Corbyn about the views of his communications director, Seumas Milne. Loughton pointed out that Milne had “praised Hamas for their spirit of resistance” at a rally and “chanted that they will not be broken”. Corbyn said he was unaware of the incident.\n"

        "text": "\nIsrael’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has accused Iran of building sites to produce missiles in Syria and Lebanon during a meeting with the UN secretary general, António Guterres – part of increasingly bellicose rhetoric from Israel and the US against Tehran.\nThe remarks, made by Netanyahu at the beginning of a meeting with Guterres on Monday, come against a background of growing Israeli anxiety over the expanding Iranian influence on its northern border.\nNetanyahu accused Iran of turning Syria into a “base of military entrenchment as part of its declared goal to eradicate Israel”.\nHe added: “It is also building sites to produce precision-guided missiles towards that end, in both Syria and in Lebanon. This is something Israel cannot accept. This is something the UN should not accept.”\nIsrael has pointed to Tehran’s steadily increasing influence in the region during the six-year-old Syrian conflict, whether via its own Revolutionary Guard forces or Shia Muslim proxies, especially Hezbollah.\nNetanyahu’s remarks follow recent comments by the fiercely pro-Israel US ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley. She accused the UN peacekeeping commander in Lebanon, Maj Gen Michael Beary, of being “blind” to the spread of illegal arms and reiterated a call for the force to do more about it. \n\n\n\n\nWhite House 'pressuring' intelligence officials to find Iran in violation of nuclear deal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Gen Beary says there are no Hezbollah weapons,” Haley said. “That’s an embarrassing lack of understanding on what’s going on around him.”\nBeary pushed back at US and Israeli criticism, saying his force had no evidence of weapons being illegally transferred and stockpiled in the area, and that “if there was a large cache of weapons, we would know about it”.\nEarlier in August, Israeli media broadcast what it said were images from Israel’s Eros B satellite, showing a site in north-west Syria near the town of Baniyas that it claimed was intended to be a missile storage site. \nIt has become clear that the Netanyahu government and senior Israeli defence officials badly misjudged the trajectory of the war in Syria, which Israel had hoped would turn into a quagmire for the Syrian president Bashar al-Assad’s key ally, Iran, and for Lebanon’s Iranian-backed Hezbollah.\nHowever, after the intervention of Russia on Assad’s side, the war has swung in favour of the Syrian president and his allies, prompting Israeli officials to become increasingly concerned by a “day after” scenario that would mean Iranian power being projected on to its doorstep.\nGuterres arrived in Israel on Sunday for a three-night trip. In his first official visit to the country, he is expected to discuss the humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip, as well as ways to promote the moribund peace process between Israel and Palestine. \n\n\n\n\nTwo North Korean shipments to Syria intercepted in six months, UN told\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“I dream that I will have the chance to see in the Holy Land two states able to live together in mutual recognition, but also in peace and security,” Guterres said at Netanyahu’s office on Monday.\nGuterres spoke of improving economic and social conditions for Palestinians to provide them with a “dividend” and incentive for peace. He is due in Ramallah on Tuesday for talks with the Palestinian prime minister, Rami Hamdallah.\nNetanyahu’s remarks to Guterres on Iran follow his warning to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, this month that Israel might be prepared to act unilaterally to prevent Tehran establishing a garrison on the country’s doorstep.\nMeeting Putin in the Black Sea resort of Sochi, Netanyahu said Iran – which Russian officials have said has had a stabilising influence in Syria – was fighting to cement an arc of influence from the Gulf to the Mediterranean.\n“Iran is already well on its way to controlling Iraq, Yemen and, to a large extent, is already in practice in control of Lebanon,” Netanyahu told Putin.\n“We cannot forget for a single minute that Iran threatens every day to annihilate Israel,” he added. “Israel opposes Iran’s continued entrenchment in Syria. We will be sure to defend ourselves with all means against this and any threat.”\n"

        "text": "\nLebanese leaders have stepped up demands for the return of Saad Hariri, insisting his resignation as prime minister in Riyadh last week was made under duress and that his Saudi hosts have limited his movements.\nHariri’s unexpected departure has placed Lebanon at the heart of an intensifying power tussle between Riyadh and Tehran, and has alarmed allies of the fragile state who are scrambling to contain a move they describe as destabilising and a threat to the regional order.\nThe former Lebanese prime minister has since spoken strongly against Hezbollah, the powerful militia-cum-political bloc, with which he shared government, and attacked its patron, Iran. His heated rhetoric has matched that of Saudi leaders, leading officials in Beirut to claim he has been scripted to attack an arch Saudi foe as a “test of loyalty”.\nAs the diplomatic fallout from Hariri’s exit intensified, France urged he return to “play an essential role”.\nLebanon, however, has been captive to foreign interests throughout its history and has been central to a power struggle over the past 20 years between Tehran and Riyadh, which have both financed and backed rival political blocs.\nThe country’s fate has become ever more contested as Iran has made battlefield gains in Iraq and Syria, and has further consolidated its hold over Lebanese affairs. After five years in exile in Riyadh, Saudi leaders consented last December to Hariri returning to Beirut to form a government.\nThe 11 months since have seen Lebanon edge further into the Iranian orbit, after the naming of pro-Iran president, Michel Aoun. At the same time, Saudi’s new leadership has moved to a more bellicose foreign posture, devoting more resources to the war in Yemen and opening a diplomatic spat with Qatar, partly because of the small state’s alliance with Iran.\nThe new Saudi stance has placed it firmly in the camp of the Trump administration in Washington and led to a convergence of interests with Israel, which, like Saudi Arabia, sees a fast rising threat from Iran’s new influence across the Middle East. With the war against the Islamic State all but won in Iraq and Syria’s civil war winding down, the focus of all three has has pointedly shifted to Lebanon.\n“There is no legitimate place or role in Lebanon for any foreign forces, militias or armed elements other than the legitimate security forces of the Lebanese state,” the US secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, said on Friday, echoing recent Saudi talking points.\nAmerica’s top diplomat also cautioned against “any party, within or outside Lebanon, using Lebanon as a venue for proxy conflicts or in any manner contributing to instability in that country”.\nWell-placed sources in Beirut and Riyadh believe Saudi Arabia’s renewed dissatisfaction with Lebanon – and Hariri – at least partly stems from two recent statements by senior Iranian officials, one of them on the day he was summonsed to Riyadh for a second time in a week last Friday.\nOn that day, Hariri met with Ali Akbar Velayati, the foreign affairs adviser to Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. A statement posted on his website, attributed to Velayati said: “The Lebanese victory against terrorism, the Syrian victory against terrorism, the Iraqi victory against separatists means that the axis of resistance has achieved victory in the battles in the region and this is a victory for us all.”\nOn 23 October, the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, said: “No decision is taken in Lebanon without Iran.” Hariri rebuked Rouhani the next day, saying: “Lebanon is an independent country that doesn’t accept tutelage.”\nSeveral hours after the Velayati meeting, Hariri abruptly left an event he was hosting in Beirut for the visiting French culture minister and left for Riyadh. He travelled with only two bodyguards and without any of his aides – a highly unusual move.\nHe resigned as prime minister last Saturday – a move that has not been recognised, even by his political bloc, the Future Movement in Beirut. On Thursday, Fouad Siniora, a former prime minister and senior Future figure, called on him to return, claiming he was still Lebanon’s prime minister. \nAoun also called for Hariri’s return, as did Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. \nAoun said: “We condemn the blunt, bare-faced Saudi intervention in our domestic affairs. Any offence to the Lebanese prime minister is an offence to all Lebanese, even when he is our adversary.”\nHariri’s aides refused to comment on Friday, and western diplomats who had visited him in Riyadh said he had insisted he was not being held against his will. \n“They don’t have to hold him hostage. They have so much leverage over him. He is semi-reluctant to be doing this. But he wants to be back in their favour. He needs them,” said on informed reginonal official, speaking on condition of anonymity.\nHariri’s sudden metamorphosis into the spearhead of a regional crisis appears to be odds with his moves over the past year to assemble a government and rebuild his personal finances, which were decimated by the collapse of the Saudi construction sector from mid-2015. A construction company he chaired, Saudi Oger, was heavily affected by the decline and is in liquidation, with he and the Saudi government attempting to recover losses.\n“It helps him to be in good odour with them [Saudi officials],” the source said. “The regional politics are very important to them. He will do what he has to do.”\n"

        "text": "\nLebanon, “the house of many mansions”, has endured an apparently endless series of wars and crises. Now its foundations are shaking once again. The tectonic plates have shifted anew with Iran’s rise, and now this tiny, fragile state is at the heart of the struggle between the two great regional powers and other major players.\nOn Thursday, Saudi Arabia urged its citizens to leave Lebanon immediately after days of tensions that broke through the surface last weekend with the shock resignation of the prime minister, Saad Hariri, who blamed Iranian influence and said he feared assassination. That he made his uncomfortable statement from Riyadh – and remains there – reinforced the assumption that he had been strong-armed into doing so. On the same night came the announcement that a missile had been shot down close to Riyadh. Yemen’s Houthi rebels claimed responsibility, but Saudi officials quickly drew the line to Hezbollah and its patron Iran for this “act of war”. There are fears the standoff could escalate into an outright military clash.\nUnderlying all this is Riyadh’s concern that Iran, its ambitions sped by its intervention to support Bashar al-Assad and the fight against Islamic State, is only months away from completing its establishment of a “Shia crescent” across the region. That fear, which stirs ancestral anxieties in the Middle East, is shared by a US administration that has abandoned Barack Obama’s turn towards Tehran – if not yet the accompanying nuclear deal – and by Israel, which has a still more immediate concern. If it hoped the war in Syria would weaken Hezbollah, it has been disappointed: the opposite has happened. Israel looks across its borders at a confident, well-armed and very close foe. For months there have been growing warnings of another war like 2006’s devastating conflict.\nThese converging interests, and Iran’s closeness to achieving unprecedented influence, all point in an alarming direction. The personality of the players, notably Saudi Arabia’s extraordinarily confident new crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, and his eager backer Donald Trump, adds an extra dimension of risk. He has given a blank cheque to the Saudi crown prince, even if some in the administration are still trying to use US influence to rein in Riyadh.\nThe crown prince has already led the charge into a disastrous war in Yemen which is draining Saudi coffers by billions each month, apparently at little cost to Iran, whose support for the rebels has been much exaggerated. His attempts to coerce Qatar into line have failed. If he has a game plan in Lebanon it is not clear: Mr Hariri’s resignation highlights Hezbollah’s power, but who will replace him? That is one reason some fear a physical intervention. The French president’s trip to the Saudi capital suggests that at least some are trying to calm the waters, but how much influence Europe can exert remains to be seen. Russia’s plans and interests in the region are another critical, and opaque, issue.\nBut if Israel and Saudi Arabia are coordinating, my enemy’s enemy is not always much of a friend. For a pillar of the Islamic world to engage in an overt alliance with Israel would be extraordinarily risky. Each side would like the other to do the hard work – and neither is keen to oblige, fully aware of the potential costs. Riyadh’s very public interference in Lebanon has if anything made it harder for Israel to act. Meanwhile, the Iranians have no desire to sabotage themselves by getting dragged into open conflict when they are so close to their goal. All know that a war could prove not just very bloody but unpredictable and uncontrollable.\nAll that offers reassurance of a sort: a very poor sort. In such tense situations there is always the danger that misjudgments, misinterpretations and plain old mistakes will spark a conflagration. But even if that is avoided, tensions have been ratcheted to their highest level since 2006. De-escalation is not in sight. Dodging a war is not a solution; only a deferral.\n"

        "text": "\nMichael Williams, Lord Williams of Baglan, who has died aged 67 after suffering from cancer, was a senior United Nations diplomat with a knack for turning the organisation’s principles into action on the ground, most successfully in the aftermath of the 2006 war between Israel and the Lebanese militia, Hezbollah. Williams’s work in Lebanon between 2006 and 2011 was the culmination of his role as an effective, if largely unsung, troubleshooter for the UN, in locations from Cambodia to the former Yugoslavia and the Middle East.\nThe six-week conflict had left large parts of Lebanon in ruins, but the Israelis felt they had failed to win a convincing victory. As for the Hezbollah fighters, they proclaimed themselves victors merely for surviving the Israeli onslaught. Inside Lebanon, the political situation was more than usually explosive following the 2005 assassination of the former prime minister Rafik Hariri, which the UN had promised to investigate.\nWilliams understood that a semblance of peace on the border would arise through a balance of deterrence between Israel and Hezbollah, and only the UN could broker this, since the US and British governments ban their diplomats from any contact with the group. Despite its 30-year history of violence and terrorism, Hezbollah had to be acknowledged as a key influence on the Lebanese government.\nAs a UN official, Williams had the unique freedom to cross the border at will, acting as both bridge and barrier between the Israeli army and Hezbollah. He gained the confidence of the Hezbollah security chief Hajj Wafiq Safa, who appears to have enjoyed the diplomat’s sense of humour. “Each side was eager to learn my assessment of the other,” he wrote later. Safa “would interrupt me impatiently to establish if a view I expressed reflected my own opinions or those of the Israelis”.\nIn the end, he established “rudimentary confidence” between the enemies, allowing the resolution of the fate of the two Israeli soldiers whose kidnap in a cross-border raid sparked the war, and permitting an exchange of prisoners. The understandings reached at that time have made the border more stable than at any time since the 1970s. Thanks to Williams’s personal touch, he managed to maintain the respect of all parties in Lebanon despite his engagement with Hezbollah. Jean-Marie Guéhenno, former head of UN peacekeeping, said of Williams: “He was the UN at its best: humility, integrity, wisdom.”\nMichael was born in Bridgend, south Wales, the son of Emlyn Williams, a steelmaker, and his wife Mildred (nee Morgan), and went to Sandfields comprehensive in Port Talbot. A voracious reader as a child, he gained a degree in international relations at University College London in 1971 and went on to do a master’s degree and doctorate at Soas, with a thesis on Islam and politics in Indonesia.\nHis break into the international civil service came in 1992 when the UN set about rebuilding Cambodia after the ruinous legacy of the Vietnam war. The UN needed someone to run a radio station to explain to the Cambodians what the 20,000-strong mission was doing. Knowledgable about south-east Asia and having worked for the BBC World Service and Amnesty International, Williams was a perfect fit.\nThe job went well and he was sent to the former Yugoslavia, as spokesman for the UN Protection Force (Unprofor). This was a far tougher assignment. Unprofor was a woefully under-resourced outfit viewed by much of the foreign press corps as too feeble to take on the Serbs. In the Goražde crisis of 1994, Williams struggled to control an angry crowd of journalists baying for military action against the Serbs in eastern Bosnia. But in months to come, as one of the reporters recalled, he gained their respect through his mastery of the strategic leak.\nFrom these beginnings, Williams, a Welsh Labour party member, moved to Whitehall in 2000 as special adviser to the foreign secretary, Robin Cook. When Tony Blair moved Cook from the post in 2001, his successor, Jack Straw, kept Williams on, despite the politicians’ very different temperaments and approaches. He later served as Middle East adviser to a third foreign secretary, David Miliband.\nHis experience on the frontline and in policymaking won Williams a series of Middle Eastern posts at the UN in New York which led to his appointment in 2008 as special co-ordinator for Lebanon with the title of under-secretary-general. His speedy ascent raised eyebrows at UN headquarters, but he proved his ability to do business with Israeli generals and warlords of every stripe in Lebanon.\nIn 2010 he entered the House of Lords as a Labour peer, but became a crossbencher to meet the impartiality requirement of his appointment in 2011 as international trustee on the BBC Trust.\nIn December last year, after moving to the Cotswolds from Steyning, West Sussex, to avoid the disruptions on Southern Rail, he suffered from back pain and stomach upsets. In February he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and, despite his rapidly deteriorating health, continued to travel to London to Chatham House, the policy research centre where from 2011 he was a distinguished fellow, and attend debates in the Lords.\nHe is survived by his second wife, Isobelle Jaques, whom he married in 1992, and their son, Ben, and by a daughter, Rhiannon, from his first marriage, to Margaret Rigby, which ended in divorce.\n• Michael Charles Williams, Lord Williams of Baglan, diplomat, born 11 June 1949; died 23 April 2017\n"

        "text": "\nHezbollah has confirmed its military commander, Mustafa Badreddine, was killed in Syria this week in what it described as a “major explosion” at Damascus airport.\nMedia reports in Lebanon and Israel quickly suggested the blast had been caused by an Israeli airstrike, a suggestion to which Hezbollah gave weight, announcing it was investigating whether a “missile or artillery strike” had been responsible.\nBadreddine was the most senior member of the organisation to have been killed since the death of his predecessor and brother-in-law, Imad Mughniyeh, who was assassinated by a joint Mossad/CIA operation in the Syrian capital in February 2008.\nThere was no immediate reaction from the Israeli government, which has authorised at least eight air strikes against targets inside Syria since the start of the civil war five years ago. Most had targeted anti-aircraft systems that Israeli officials claimed were being moved to Lebanon, where they could pose a threat against its air force.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Mustafa Amine Badreddine, in an undated handout picture released at the Special Tribunal for Lebanon website.\n\n\nAnnouncing Badreddine’s death, Hezbollah said: “He said months ago that he would not return from Syria except as a martyr or carrying the flag of victory. He is the great jihadi leader Mustafa Badreddine, and he has returned today a martyr.”\nThe statement added: “The information gleaned from the initial investigation is that a major explosion targeted one of our centres near Damascus International airport, which led to the martyrdom of Sayyid Zul Fikar [his nom de guerre] and the injuries of others.\n“The investigation will work to determine the nature of the explosion and its causes, whether it was due to an air or missile or artillery strike, and we will announce the results of the investigation soon.”\nNicknamed Zul Fikar, after the sword of Imam Ali, the Prophet Muhammad’s cousin and one of the most revered figures in Shia Islam, Badreddine was born in 1961 in the southern Beirut suburb of Ghobeiry, and rose to greater prominence after Mughniyeh’s assassination.\n\nDamascus airport\n\nHe was sentenced to death in Kuwait in the 1980s over a plot to blow up the American and French embassies there during the Iran-Iraq war, but later escaped after Saddam Hussein’s army invaded the oil-rich emirate and threw open its prisons.\nHezbollah said he had been involved in nearly all the group’s operations since its inception in the early 1980s. Most had targeted Israel, which occupied southern Lebanon from 1982 to 2000. However, Badreddine had also been accused of leading a cell that was allegedly responsible for the assassination of former Lebanese prime minister Rafiq Hariri on the Beirut waterfront in February 2005.\nHe was indicted in 2011 by the special tribunal for Lebanon, an international court established in the Hague, in connection with the massive 2005 bombing, which led Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad to withdraw his forces from Lebanon in the face of a civic uprising.\nBadreddine and four other alleged members of Hezbollah remain on trial in absentia at the Hague. Prosecutors have offered one of the few publicly available glimpses of the shadowy Hezbollah operative, describing him as the “apex” of the cell that allegedly killed Hariri, and a figure akin to an “untraceable ghost” who assumed multiple identities.\n\n\n\n\n'Nobody wants to stay in Lebanon. It’s a miserable life'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe was known to have studied at a Lebanese university and to have maintained an apartment in the Lebanese seaside area of Jounieh. He was also active in the south Beirut suburb of Dahiyeh, where he was last seen early last year at a wake for Jihad Mughniyeh, the son of Imad Mughniyeh, who was also killed by an Israeli airstrike.\nWhile holding senior positions throughout his career, Badreddine was most known for his role in leading Hezbollah’s large contingent in Syria, which it sent to defend the interest of the Assad regime as his grip on power weakened in 2012. Hezbollah has since lost an estimated 900 members in fighting across Syria, where along with Iran, it has taken the lead in directing numerous battles.\nIsrael has refused to comment on airstrikes it has previously launched inside Syria. However, unnamed officials have said the strikes had targeted anti-aircraft systems that were allegedly being transferred to Hezbollah. It had also targeted a Hezbollah leader, Samir Kuntar, who had been jailed inside Israel for more than 30 years until his release in 2008.\nDespite Israeli protests, Russia has recently proceeded with a long-delayed sale to Iran of the advanced S-300 weapons system, which can shoot down most modern fighter jets. Israeli officials have said they would prioritise tracking the whereabouts of the systems, the position of which in southern Lebanon would pose a potent threat to their air force.\nThe US treasury department sanctioned Badreddine in 2012 for his activities in support of the government of Assad in Syria, along with the group’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and its head of external operations, Talal Hamiyah.\nHezbollah said it would hold funeral services on Friday in honour of Badreddine. In south Beirut, posters of Badreddine, whose image had rarely been published, were being hung from overpasses and lamp-posts.\nTens of thousands of mourners are expected to pay their respects at a shrine site for Hezbollah dead, which includes the graves of Imad and Jihad Mughniyah. Nasrallah is also expected to make a public statement – his second within a week.\n• This article was amended on 16 May 2016 to clarify a reference to Israel’s occupation of southern Lebanon.\n"

        "text": "\nMustafa Badreddine, a senior Hezbollah commander, was killed last month in a mysterious explosion in Damascus. In a public acknowledgment of his role in the party’s numerous exploits, Hezbollah held a massive funeral attended by thousands of the party’s officials and supporters, including Badreddine’s brother.\nHis casket was carried after receiving full military honours and a marching band performance to his final resting place in the party’s cemetery in the southern suburbs of Beirut, next to his comrade-in-arms and brother-in-law Imad Mughniyeh, who was assassinated in 2008 in a car bomb prepared jointly by the CIA and Mossad.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n \nThousands mourn top Hezbollah commander killed in Syria\n\n\nBut in a move described as “Kafkaesque” by a source close to the proceedings, on Wednesday an international tribunal in The Hague prosecuting Badreddine for alleged terrorism offences decided to continue his trial, citing insufficient evidence that he was dead.\nBoth defence and prosecution teams told the court they believed the evidence proved that Badreddine is dead. But in a two-to-one decision, the trial chamber of the Special Tribunal for Lebanon said the deceased Hezbollah commander would continue to stand trial.\n“The trial chamber does not believe that sufficient evidence has yet been presented to convince it that the death of Mustafa Amine Badreddine has been proved to the requisite standard,” the Special Tribunal for Lebanon’s judges said. “The trial will therefore continue pending the receipt of further information we anticipate from the government of Lebanon.”\n\n\n\n\nThousands gather for funeral of Hezbollah's Mustafa Badreddine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProsecutors allege that Badreddine was the apex of a cell that organised and carried out the massive bombing in downtown Beirut in 2005 that killed Lebanon’s popular billionaire former prime minister, Rafik Hariri. The civil uprising that followed the truck-bomb attack led to the withdrawal of Syrian troops from the country.\nBadreddine was being tried in absentia because Hezbollah had refused to hand over its commander to an international tribunal in The Hague. The party denies all allegations that its members played a role in Hariri’s killing, and claims the tribunal is a joint American-Israeli conspiracy.\n“It’s unbelievable,” a source close to the proceedings told the Guardian. “This is Kafkaesque. Two full days of court time and hundreds of lawyers.”\nThe tribunal will likely continue prosecuting the assassinated Hezbollah operative until it receives a death certificate from the Lebanese authorities – a tricky proposition since the commander did not leave much of a paper trail throughout his life.\nBadreddine is not the first high-profile defendant to die before his day in an international court. Slobodan Milošević, the former president of Serbia, died in the midst of his trial in The Hague for war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in the Balkans.\nIn a dissenting opinion, Judge Micheline Braidy of the trial chamber outlined why she believed it was obvious the shadowy commander had been slain.\n“I’m convinced that Mr Mustafa Amine Badreddine is deceased,” Judge Braidy said. “Those events which have persuaded me include the following, mainly ... media reports of Mr Badreddine’s death, nationally and internationally; the video of the condolences ceremony on 13th of May 2016; funeral speeches delivered on the 13th of May 2016; the video of the casket entering the martyr cemetery of Rawdat-El-Shahidayn in Ghobeiry; the photo of the grave; the statement of Hezbollah regarding the cause of Mr Badreddine’s death; the visit of the Iranian delegation on the 14th May 2016, namely, the deputy foreign minister of Iran; the ceremony in Syria, attended by officials, Syrian, Palestinian, and Iranians; the ceremony held in Beirut on the 20th of May with the attendance of the family of Mr Badreddine; the ceremony held in Tehran, attended by the Badreddine relatives; the family declaration of the death of Mr Badreddine.”\n"

        "text": "\nA group of 26 Qatari royals held hostage in Iraq by an Iranian-backed militia have been released after nearly 18 months in captivity as part of an extraordinary regional pact centred on four besieged Syrian towns.\nThe royals, many of them cousins of Qatar’s emir, were handed over to the Iraqi interior minister on Friday by the powerful Keta’eb Hezbollah group, which seized the royals during a December 2015 hunting trip in the deserts of southern Iraq.\n\n\n\n\nQatari royal family members used as leverage in Syrian population swap\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fate of the Qataris had increasingly been tied up with that of two Shia villages west of Aleppo and two Sunni towns near the Lebanese border, whose populations had been part of delicate negotiations for the past year. On Friday evacuations from the four communities were continuing.\nAhrar al-Sham, a Syrian militia group, said 500 prisoners were released from Syrian regime jails on Friday, as another component of the deal.\nThe so-called four towns deal has been brokered by Iran and Qatar and involved many of the region’s most powerful non-state players, including Lebanese Hezbollah and the latest incarnation of the al-Qaida-inspired Syrian group Jabhat al-Nusra.\nLebanese Hezbollah and Keta’eb Hezbollah are Iranian proxies; the former has been heavily involved in the Syrian civil war and the latter has played a prominent role in Iraqi affairs, fighting against US forces and having involvement in the war with Isis. Qatar has been a key backer of Ahrar al-Sham, a powerful Islamist opposition group in northern Syria. It has also been accused of links to al-Nusra.\nAs revealed exclusively by the Guardian last week, the deal has involved large ransom demands and payments, secret summits in the Qatari capital, Doha, and comes amid claims that Syria’s demography is being re-engineered to suit the interests of Iran and its proxies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  In an image posted on Twitter, fighters from Ahrar al-Sham march in the eastern Damascus suburb of Ghouta, Syria. Photograph: Uncredited/AP\n\n\nIt also led to the slaughter of more than 125 Shia civilians last Saturday when a suicide bomber drove a car into buses carrying people migrating across Syria.\nThe royals were received in Baghdad before being returned to Doha, where the latest phase of the deal had been finalised. Although the men had been missing for almost a year, their return was not tied to negotiations in Syria until last November, after which talks that had previously stalled in Istanbul between Ahrar al-Sham and Iran gained new impetus.\nNone of the stakeholders would discuss ransom payments, or publicly admit that money had changed hands for the deal to go ahead. However, Keta’eb Hezbollah is known to have put a price on the return of its captives, and both Syrian militias had agreed to facilitate the exodus from Fuaa and Kefraya after discussions with Qatari brokers.\nOfficials in Baghdad said a Qatari plane that arrived in Baghdad on Saturday was carrying large bags that Qatari government officials refused to allow to be searched. Iraqi officials said they believed that the bags had contained cash that was used to finalise the release.\nMeanwhile, Shia refugees in Syria said some among them had been taken to east Aleppo, which was recaptured from the anti-Assad opposition last December. Others had been taken to a regime neighbourhood of Homs, and more to the western suburbs of Damascus.\nHundreds more people left the Sunni village of Madaya near the Lebanese border on Friday, for Idlib province. Thousands more had chosen to remain after receiving assurances from Hezbollah that they would not be forced to leave.\nThe area between west Damascus and the Lebanese border is strategically sensitive for the Lebanese militia and the Syrian regime, which it has backed throughout much of the war. Earlier in negotiations, according to Ahrar al-Sham, Iran had proposed a direct swap of Shia villagers for Sunni residents, with Shias repopulating the towns of Zabadani, Madaya and Qusair, bordering Lebanon.\n"

        "text": "\nThe fates of 26 members of a Qatari royal hunting party held hostage for more than a year in Iraq were used to help negotiate a population swap in Syria, where residents on Friday started leaving two Shia villages and two Sunni towns in a synchronised easing of a four-year siege brokered by regional powers.\nResidents of the Shia areas of Fua and Kefraya, in northern Syria, were transported to nearby east Aleppo as the first buses began leaving Zabadani and Madaya, Sunni strongholds between Damascus and the Lebanese border, for a final destination somewhere in the rebel-held areas of Idlib province.\nThe deal was finalised in recent days after nearly two years of negotiations between one of Syria’s main opposition groups, Ahrar al-Sham, and Iran. The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah and Qatar have also been central – both taking a stake five months ago when members of Doha’s ruling family were offered up as a component of the swap.\nThe agreement, and the regional choreography surrounding it, marks one of the most sensitive episodes of the Syrian war. Iran and Hezbollah have been determined not to cast the moves as a demographic swap, while Ahrar al-Sham and members of the Syrian political opposition insist that what has been proposed cannot be characterised otherwise.\nAs the Guardian reported in January, Iran had earlier tied the future of both Sunni towns to the fate of Fua and Kefraya. While the plan at its essence involves relocating four local populations, the intimate involvement of regional powers underscores how deeply embedded the conflict has become in a broader proxy war for power and influence. \nThe involvement of Bashar al-Assad’s regime has meanwhile been negligible, with Iran and Qatar seeking the release of 1,500 prisoners from Syrian jails, but not including regime officials in discussions.\nTwo Qataris, both members of a falcon hunting party that had crossed from Saudi Arabia to Iraq where they were captured in December 2015, were released earlier in the week as the deal neared implementation. Sources close to the negotiations have told the Guardian that urgent efforts to secure the fate of the remaining men led to the plan being finalised.\nDiscussions between all four parties have taken place in Doha since the start of the year. The group holding the Qatari royals is understood to be Kata’eb Hezbollah, one of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards’ main proxies in Iraq, whose former leader, Akram al-Ka’abi, has led Iranian-backed militias in Syria.\nFua and Kefraya, where up to 40,000 residents have been besieged by Islamist groups and jihadists, have been focal points of al-Ka’abi’s operations in Syria. Hezbollah has been heavily deployed in the villages and had envisaged that residents would be directly swapped for those leaving Madaya and Zabadani. \n\nSyria four towns map\n\nThe latest version of the plan is to move the families into east Aleppo, which was recaptured from the Syrian opposition in December. The area between the Syrian capital and the Lebanese border has become increasingly vital for Iran and Hezbollah, which have stepped up efforts to shape the aftermath of post-war Syria according to their interests. The Lebanese border towns of Baalbek and Hermel are where Hezbollah was founded 35 years ago and have been focal points of the group’s training and command efforts ever since.\nSyrian opposition officials say they now suspect that Fua and Kefraya residents will now slowly be moved into the two Sunni towns. “It will be attritional,” said one official close to negotiations. “They will join Hezbollah leaders and their families who have already relocated from Lebanon.”\nTwo Kefraya families who spoke to the Guardian on Friday said they had been told that they would stay in Aleppo temporarily before being moved elsewhere, possibly near the Sayeda Zainab shrine in west Damascus, or to Zabadani, or Madaya.\n Yousef, one of the recent evacuees from Fua’a who is now housed near the Sayyeda Zainab shrine – a focal point of Shia-led efforts to bolster Assad – said he was anxious for his family to join him. “We don’t know where we will end up living, but it is a relief that we got out of the siege,” he said. “We don’t want to take the homes of the residents of Zabadani and Madaya, as we don’t want them to take ours, but it is not for us to decide.”\nIn Zabadani, one local man, who called himself Ammar, said 3,200 civilians had left both towns on Friday. “It seems that the people of Idlib are opposing the deal and they don’t want those leaving Fua’a and Kefraya to be allowed to leave because they consider them as a guarantee of their own safety. They think that once those residents are gone, there will be retaliation against them similar to Khan Sheikhoun [the site of a sarin attack on 4 April]. Any demographic swap will take time and will be done gradually.”\nSyrian officials have described evacuations of local populations earlier in the war, including one such arrangement in Homs earlier this month, as locally agreed reconciliation deals. The moves have involved rebels surrendering their weapons and agreeing to exile, typically in Idlib province, where jihadi groups play a prominent role among the remnants of the Syrian opposition. The agreements have all followed prolonged sieges, which have led to severe hunger and reports of malnutrition.\nAdditional reporting by Suzan Haidamous\n"

Trump has argued that Iran’s support for such groups violates the spirit of the nuclear deal.\nIranian officials say privately that Trump’s ability to unravel the nuclear deal is bound by the US Congress and the reaction of Washington’s allies in Europe. They warn, however, that a move against the IRGC would be a step too far and could even push the two countries towards open war. \nPolitical leaders in Tehran are keen to show unity. A smiling IRGC commander, Mohammad Ali Jafari, was photographed earlier this week arm in arm with the foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, the architect of the nuclear deal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  The IRGC commander, Mohammad Ali Jafari, and Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif. Photograph: Handout/Reuters\n\n\nJafari has said that US military bases in the region would be open to attack if his forces were designated a terrorist group. Zarif’s ministry has said that Tehran’s reaction would be “firm, decisive and crushing”. Even the country’s moderate president, Hassan Rouhani, who five months ago made a rare public criticism of the IRGC during his run for a second term, issued his full-throated support for the force, saying that it “has a place in people’s heart”.\nFarideh Farhi, an academic who monitors Iranian affairs closely, said that designating the IRGC as a terrorist group would be unprecedented. \n“The IRGC is a integral part of Iran’s military defence and has constitutional standing as such. The designation of military officers of another country as terrorist will be a first and will open the US military to reciprocal action,” she said. \nParticularly at risk, Farhi said, would be US special forces operating in the Middle East. \nThe IRGC initially operated as a local force across Iran, but it expanded quickly after Saddam Hussein invaded Iran in 1980 and Khomeini allowed it to have its own ground, navy and air forces. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Revolutionary guards in wargames near Qom, south of Tehran.

Their performance in the war gave them a seat at the proverbial power table,” said Mehrzad Boroujerdi, a professor of political science at Syracuse University in the US. \nKhomeini, however, remained wary of its growing force, writing an explicit command for it to stay away from politics into his will. \nAfter succeding Khomeini in 1989, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei introduced a new dimension to the IRGC’s operational capacity by creating the Quds force, which is in charge of its overseas operations and has worked closely with Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Palestine.\nTehran has never concealed its backing for Hamas and Hezbollah, which it sees as legitimate political parties that have won elections legally, said Ali Alizadeh, a London-based political analyst. \nSuch activities have infuriated the US and Iran’s regional rivals, but the IRGC’s operations in Lebanon, Bosnia and Iraq – and more recently its involvement in propping up Syria’s Bashar al-Assad – have hugely endeared them to Khamenei.\nThe US also alleges that Iran has been behind a series of bombings in Iraq that has led to the death of US military personnel, accusations that Iranian officials say are not substantiated. A string of senior IRGC and Quds force officers are already blacklisted and subject to US sanctions. \nDespite the dying wishes of Khomeini, the IRGC did become politically active, most notoriously when its Basij militia helped to crush protests after the disputed 2009 elections.\n\n\n\n\nQassem Suleimani: can this man bring about the downfall of Isis? | Observer profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSoon afterwards it launched a bid to restore its tarnished domestic image by presenting Qassem Suleimani, the commander of the Quds force, as a national military hero who has defended the country from Sunni terror groups. \n“When it comes to the current imploding situation in the Middle East, Khamenei is much more prone to listen to Jafari and Suleimani than to Rouhani or Zarif,” said Boroujerdi. “The guards’ institutional capability to exert influence on foreign, domestic and security policies is beyond doubt now.”\nAfter years operating in the shadows, Suleimani – who was often portrayed as a kind of regional puppet-master of terror – has emerged into the limelight, his presence on the battlefield of Syria and Iraq breathlessly reported in state media. Hoardings in Tehran portray the IRGC as defenders of the nation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Guards commander Qassem Suleimani has been portrayed as a regional terror master. Photograph: AFP/Getty Images\n\n\nOne billboard that recently appeared in Tehran shows the firing of five missiles, in reference to the IRGC’s occasional and controversial testing of ballistic weapons, emblazoned with the words: “I am the Guardian of Iran.”\nLike the Pakistani and Chinese militaries, the IRGC also has a large stake in the Iranian economy, both in legal and illegal enterprises. Guard commanders own large swaths of real estate in Tehran and are accused of involvement in lucrative cross-border smuggling operations.\n“The IRGC’s domestic ascendancy is not unique, nor is its future trajectory immutable,” said a recent report from the US Rand thinktank. “As its history has shown, the IRGC is subject to the same worldly pitfalls and evolutionary mutations that affect other bureaucracies, and this will only intensify as the IRGC delves deeper into profit-making financial activities. Indeed, from this observation, there is benefit in comparing the IRGC’s past and future with the evolution of the Pakistani military and Chinese People’s Liberation Army.”\nMohsen Sazegara was a founding member of Khomeni’s sepah, but is now an exiled dissident and an outspoken critic of the organisation he helped establish. “We created a people’s army to defend the country and also help in emergencies, but it turned into a monster,” he told the Guardian. \n“Its transformation during the Iran-Iraq war, then the creation of the Quds force, its involvement in financial activities and its role in suppressing reformists has turned it into a country inside a country, a government inside a government and an organisation that has no equivalent anywhere in the world. It’s like a river that is overflowing, covering everything.”\n"

        "text": "\nElias Saab. Sami Issa. Safi Badr. Zul Fikar. All were aliases of Hezbollah’s secretive military commander, Mustafa Amine Badreddine, described in court records as an “untraceable ghost”.\n\n\n\n\nLeading Hezbollah commander and key Israel target killed in Syria\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFew details are known about Badreddine, who was killed this week in a mysterious explosion at a Hezbollah base near Damascus airport. This despite him being one of the most prominent figures in the party and the brother-in-law of the notorious Imad Mughniyeh, who he succeeded as military commander after the latter was killed in a 2008 joint CIA-Mossad operation in the Syrian capital.\nBorn in the southern Beirut suburb of Ghobeiry on 6 April 1961, Badreddine had a pronounced limp, believed to have been sustained while he fought alongside pro-Palestinian and pan-Arabist militias during the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982.\nHis nom de guerre was Sayyed Zul Fikar: Sayyed indicating a claimed descent from the prophet Muhammad; Zul Fikar being the name of the legendary forked sword of Imam Ali, the prophet’s cousin and one of the most revered figures in Shia Islam.\nBadreddine was arrested and sentenced to death in Kuwait in 1983 over his suspected involvement in a string of coordinated bombings in the tiny Gulf emirate that also targeted the US and French embassies. They were believed to be retribution for Kuwait and the west’s support for Iraq in its war with Iran.\nThe sentence, which had to be formally approved by the emir, was never carried out, perhaps as a consequence of a series of attacks and plane hijackings demanding the release of the Kuwait attackers, and which allegedly involved Mughniyeh. It was also never carried out because when the Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in August 1990, he threw open the doors of the country’s prisons, allowing Badreddine to escape.\nThis is where the trail disappears. It only emerges again in 2011, when UN prosecutors investigating a 2005 Beirut bombing that killed Lebanon’s prime minister, Rafik Hariri, indicted Badreddine. They alleged he was the coordinator of a sophisticated network that tracked and ultimately assassinated the popular billionaire.\n\n\n\n\nTen years after Hariri's assassination, Lebanon badly needs his moderation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCourt records from the special tribunal for Lebanon have offered a rare glimpse into the life of Badreddine, who was charged with conspiring to commit a terrorist act, carrying out a terrorist act by means of an explosive device, and intentional homicide.\nBadreddine studied political science at the Lebanese American University from 2002-04. He drove a Mercedes Benz, owned the Samino jewellery shop in Beirut, and an apartment in Jounieh, a coastal town north of the capital known for its active nightlife, where he supposedly entertained friends.\nHis phone’s contact list, prosecutors alleged, included the numbers of college friends and business associates, Hezbollah officials and bodyguards, family members as well as supposed girlfriends.\nBadreddine became military commander in 2008 after his brother-in-law was killed by a bomb placed in the headrest of his car. Mughniyeh had been the architect of Hezbollah’s guerrilla defence in Lebanon during the 2006 war with Israel and was implicated in the 1990s bombing of a synagogue in Argentina.\nThere are almost no images available of Badreddine. Two that were made available by the tribunal were dated, one showing him as a teenager and the other apparently from his days in Kuwait, showing a handsome young man with curly hair and a moustache, dressed in a tie-less suit. On Friday’s Hezbollah’s media department circulated an photo of the commander smiling in military fatigues and sporting a short grey beard and spectacles.\nBadreddine left few personal records. Investigators for the UN trial say they found no driving licences or passports, no property formally owned by him, no record of him ever having left Lebanon, no bank accounts, and no photos from around the time of Hariri’s assassination. In the opening sessions of his trial in absentia in The Hague, prosecutors said he “passes as an unrecognisable and untraceable ghost throughout Lebanon, leaving no footprint as he passes”.\nHezbollah vehemently denies the allegations and does not recognise the tribunal.\nIn recent years, Badreddine was mostly known for his role in leading Hezbollah’s contingent in Syria, where the paramilitary group has been instrumental in ensuring the continued survival of the Assad government, alongside its patron, Iran, where an estimated 900 of the party’s fighters have died, including Jihad Mughniyeh, Imad’s son.\nBadreddine was sanctioned by the US Treasury Department over his role in Syria in 2012.\nAn Israeli investigative journalist who is writing a history of the Mossad said the strike that killed Jihad Mughniyeh near the Golan Heights last year was actually aimed at Badreddine.\n\n"

        "text": "\nRussia summoned the Israeli ambassador to demand an explanation for Israel’s air raids in Syria last week, Moscow has confirmed, as an Israeli drone was blamed for the targeted killing of a senior pro-Assad fighter in a second reported incident. \nThe summons, made on Friday, was confirmed by Russia’s foreign ministry which said the Israeli ambassador to Moscow, Gary Koren, had been asked to explain an exchange of fire with Syrian government forces in which anti-aircraft missiles were fired at Israeli jets.\nAccording to Israel’s Channel 2, the Israeli strike hit close to Russian troops. \nRussia’s deputy foreign minister, Mikhail Bogdanov, said Russia had “expressed concern”. The diplomatic intervention marks the first apparent fracture in the secretive deconfliction arrangement between the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, over where, when and who Israeli jets can strike in Syria.\n\n\n\n\nIsraeli fighter jets fired upon during Syria mission in clash with pro-Assad forces\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIsrael had interpreted the arrangement as giving it a relatively free hand to attack warehouses and shipments of advanced weapons destined for Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed and pro-Bashar al-Assad Lebanese militant group. But Friday’s raid, reportedly by four Israeli jets which penetrated Syrian airspace, appears to have changed that dynamic after the interception of an SA-5 missile that flew into Israel forced it for the first time in the six-year Syrian civil war to acknowledge an attack.\nSyria’s use of anti-aircraft missiles against the Israeli jets, however, suggested an increased confidence in the Assad regime, which has seen a number of similar air raids by Israel. Syria’s ambassador to the UN, Bashar al-Jaafari, on Sunday insisted the Syrian response was “in line with Israel’s terrorist operation” and had “changed the rules of the game”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Israel’s ambassador to Moscow, Gary Koren. Photograph: Mikhail Pochuyev/TASS\n\n\nThe sharp uptick in tensions on Israel’s northern border has resulted in increased rhetoric by senior Israeli political and military officials, with the hardline defence minister, Avigdor Lieberman, warning that Israel would not hesitate to “destroy” Syria’s air defence system if it fired on Israeli jets again.\nIsrael was also blamed on Sunday for a drone strike near the south-west Syrian town of Quneitra which killed a man, Yasser a-Sayyed, described as a leader of the pro-Assad Homeland Defence Forces militia.\nCommenting on last week’s events, the Israeli military’s chief of staff, Gen Gadi Eisenkot, referred to the airstrike on Sunday.\n“We are taking action to prevent the transfer of advanced weaponry to Hezbollah, and we will spare no effort to prevent that in the future. Hezbollah has been violating UN resolutions and is gearing for war,” he said.\nOutside of the recent rhetoric, however, what has been fast emerging in recent months is that Israel may have badly misjudged the potential outcome of the Syrian war.\nIt had anticipated a conflict that would undermine the Assad regime, seriously wound Hezbollah and push back Iran’s attempts to expand its influence. But since Moscow’s intervention, Assad’s forces and Hezbollah have clawed back territory from rebel groups and Islamic State, creating conditions more conducive for Iran to supply weapons to the Lebanese militants.\nBrig Gen Nitzan Nuriel, a former director of counter-terrorism in the Israeli prime minister’s bureau, said conflict with Hezbollah was inevitable as the group sought ever more advanced anti-aircraft missiles, heavy rockets and tactical weapons, but he believed Assad had seriously misread the situation.\n“Assad has not read the map correctly,” he said. “He believes it is only a question of weeks or months before he can declare a full victory and is looking to the next stage. I believe he is mistaken and that clashes in Syria will stay with us for the next three to six years.”\nDiscussing Russia’s role in Syria, he added more controversially: “Russia got the messages it needs to receive from Israel.” That was, he said: “Israel will not allow anyone, including Russia to get in the way of implementing our military mission.” \n"

Israel did not disclose the area it’s forces had targeted.\nThe incident was highly unusual in that it also saw the Israeli military break its customary silence over raids in Syria to release a statement to admit that its aircraft had been targeted while operating there.\n“Overnight, March 17, IAF aircrafts [sic] targeted several targets in Syria,” said the statement. “Several anti-aircraft missiles were launched from Syria following the mission and the IDF aerial defence systems intercepted one of the missiles. At no point was the safety of Israeli civilians or the IAF aircraft compromised.”\nIsrael has largely avoided entanglement in the war in Syria , but the statement confirmed what has long been an open secret in Israel in recent years, that Israeli jets have been targeting weapons convoys linked to the transport of Iranian-supplied arms to the Lebanese group Hezbollah, which has been fighting on the side of Bashar al-Assad’s regime.\n\n\nsami abed alhamed \n(@samiaah10)\nטיל ששוגר מסוריה ונפל בשטח הכפר ענבה במחוז אירביד צפונית לירדן ללא נפגעים.הזעקות הופעלו בישובי הבקעה.הדי הפיצוץ נשמעו בירושלים וראמאללה pic.twitter.com/Bu0yTbr55B\n\nMarch 17, 2017\n\n\nAlthough Israel has operated with relative impunity in Syria, Russian-supplied anti-aircraft missile systems – including most recently S300 launchers – have long threatened to complicate Israel’s freedom of action.\nIsraeli military sources described the rocket brought down over Israel as one known to be in Syrian military arsenal – although not its most advanced – adding that it had been intercepted by its Arrow anti-missile system in its first confirmed use since being deployed in the late 1990s.\nThere has been growing concern in Israeli security circles at events turning the war in Syria in favour of the Assad regime, which is seen by some as benefiting Hezbollah in Lebanon, not least in its efforts to comprehensively rearm since the 2006 war.\n"

        "text": "\nForces loyal to Bashar al-Assad have seized control of up to one-third of rebel-held east Aleppo, meeting little resistance as they stormed northern areas of Syria’s second city leaving tens of thousands of civilians scrambling for ways to escape.\nThe speed of the advance surprised both the Syrian military and its backers as well as those who had vowed to defend opposition-held districts throughout 12 months of near constant bombardment and siege.\nIt also appeared to herald the denouement of the battle for control of a city that has been central to the fate of Syria, a country upended by nearly six years of civil war that has greatly destabilised the region and sparked one of the biggest exoduses of refugees anywhere since the end of the second world war.\nThe ground advance was led by Iraqi militias and Lebanon’s Hezbollah, both of which have played dominant roles on the eastern outskirts as preparations for the attack intensified. The Syrian army largely played a support role, sources close to Hezbollah confirmed to the Guardian on Monday. \nHowever, Syrian forces are stationed in greater numbers in the newly seized districts, with militia forces directed by Iran tasked with moving into remaining rebel areas.\nAid groups have said that as many as 250,000 people may still be in east Aleppo, with little access to food, water or medicine. For the first time in the past six months, large numbers of people – by some accounts as many as 20,000 – were attempting to flee on Monday. However, there was no clear route to the north or east. Up to 1,000 people had reportedly crossed into regime-held west Aleppo through the Sheikh Maqsoud district.\nResidents of the east described their panic as loyalist forces advanced from the airport in the east of the city to the largely abandoned Masakan Hanano neighbourhood in the north-east.\n\nAleppo map\n\n“For one month they have been attacking Masakan Hanano with airstrikes and artillery,” said Bashir Saleh from inside Aleppo. “When the advance happened, there were a lot of rebels outside of the area because the shelling and bombing was so huge last month. The truth is we were shocked at the weakness of the rebels’ defensive positions. They were directly destroyed.”\nAnother Aleppo resident, Mohamed al-Ahmed, 30, who lives in Aleppo’s old city, said: “We are so scared. We do not know what we will do. I have a cousin living in Masakan Hanano, and the information I have is that they [pro-Assad troops] took 400 people yesterday from that area to the airport, including him. We have no information about them.”\nResidents who spoke to the Guardian on Monday said they feared retribution at the hands of Syrian forces whose leaders had branded all of those who remained in rebel areas as “terrorists” and vowed to hunt them down.\n“We were living under opposition control for more than four years and of course many of us became involved with the opposition,” said one man, who refused to give his name. “Now the army is so close, of course they have information about us.”\nAnother man, who also refused to be identified, said no one in his neighbourhood of Bustan al-Qasr could leave and few would dare take an exit route to the regime-held west of the city even if they could.\n“My brother and uncle were killed at the checkpoints in early 2013,” he said. “They will come for us all now. They will speak about reconciliation and fraternity and they will kill without conscience at the same time. And the world will watch on helplessly, just as it has for the past year.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Syrian pro-government forces in Aleppo. Photograph: George Ourfalian/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\nRussian and Syrian airstrikes have systematically targeted east Aleppo’s healthcare system and all other pillars of civilian life, such as bakeries, fruit markets and civil defence. The aftermath is a landscape that barely resembles the city before July 2012, when men from the countryside overran regime positions spurred on by the momentum of an uprising that had seen much of the country slip from the grasp of the Syrian leader.\nRussian and Iranian support has been central to the Assad regime’s resurgence. Moscow has provided overwhelming firepower from the air, while Tehran has mobilised and coordinated Shia militia forces that number more than 6,000 for the move into Aleppo.\n\n\n\n\nFive maps that show how the net closed on eastern Aleppo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“When the militias advanced there was a mix of Palestinians, Iraqis, Iranian and Hezbollah,” said Najeeb, 30, from Masakan Hanano. “What can I say? We will try to fight until the last minute, we do not have another option.”\nA rebel fighter who identified himself as Imad said: “There were not enough of us to stop the advance of the attack. On the radio we heard their accents, [mainly] Iraqi. I’m sure the people in the advance were from militia but not Syrian army, but then the Syrian army came later and the media came with them.”\nOne of Aleppo’s few remaining doctors said the ground invasion had sunk morale in the east of the city. “No one knows know what we are going to do,” she said. “The psychological situation for the doctors is so bad. Everyone feels that their life is in danger and their family is in danger. We hope that the rebels can do something. A lot of families are in the streets with no place to stay. There is nothing left. There is no food, there is no heating, and we don’t know what will come next.”\nAnother resident, who also requested anonymity, said: “All the people are in the streets. There is no home for them. The airstrikes are everywhere, every minute they are burning Aleppo. There is no road to let the civilians leave. Many people prefer to die than to go to the regime side. They said we will die here, and not go to the regime; we won’t give our women to the regime. We will not give our honour to them either.”\nAdditional reporting by Salem Rizk\n"

        "text": "\nThe latest upsurge in airstrikes, hospital bombings and civilian deaths in the rebel-held Idlib province in northern Syria has elicited little in the way of protest or pushback from the Trump administration. Its silence contrasts sharply with last week’s furious US condemnation of Iran over its handling of sporadic domestic unrest. \n\n\n\n\nSyrian forces advance on country's last rebel-held province\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe comparison is instructive. In Syria’s civil war, the US has largely ceded a free hand to Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin. And Donald Trump seems to have abandoned attempts to force Bashar al-Assad, Syria’s dictator and Putin’s ally, to step down. Trump’s principal focus is not Damascus, it’s Tehran. \nThe result is something approaching impunity for killers. To take one example, 11 medical facilities in Idlib, Hama and eastern Ghouta were targeted by Russian and Syrian government airstrikes and shelling over the new year period, according to the Union of Medical Care and Relief Organisations. \nBut Trump’s attention is elsewhere. His passionate, outspoken hostility to Iran jars badly with his passivity and disinterest over the plight of Syrians dying and injured in the war. His controversial efforts to advance ties with Putin, and his wooing of the Saudis and Israelis, Iran’s sworn enemies, fit his top priority of isolating Tehran. The Syrian child victims Trump vowed to defend last April have been forgotten. \nPutin has adopted a pragmatic approach to Iran, looking for areas of common interest. But his calculations of relative advantage may be changing. The two countries collaborate on Syria, where Iran has deployed ground forces. But they have a long history of enmity. Moscow backed western-inspired curbs on Iran’s nuclear programmes. Putin’s outreach to Iran’s foes in Riyadh and Tel Aviv has induced fears in Tehran of a stab in the back. \nUnlike Iran’s hardliners and the Revolutionary Guards, Putin has indicated he could accept Assad’s dethronement if a pro-Moscow regime remains in place and Russia’s strategic Middle East interests, including military bases in Syria, are respected.\nBut for Shia Iran, the survival of Assad’s Alawite ascendancy is key to its aim to extend its physical reach to the Mediterranean coast, control Lebanon, hem in the Saudis and put pressure on Israel.\nTrump’s strong support for Israel, including his recent recognition of Jerusalem as its capital, is mirrored by Putin. “Under Putin’s leadership, Russia has developed the best relationship it has ever had with Israel,” said Josh Cohen, a US analyst.\nPutin has reportedly instructed both Assad and Hezbollah not to retaliate against Israeli strikes in Syria – the latest took place on Tuesday. Israeli media claim Putin even proposed a deal preventing foreign powers from using Syria as a base for attacking a neighbouring state, a concept in conflict with Iran’s current posture. \nAll these developments underline how Putin has become the go-to man in the Middle East – and why Iran has much to fear from deepening Trump-Putin collaboration. Trump is threatening new sanctions this week over Tehran’s crackdown on street protests. Under US law, Trump has until Friday to decide whether to pull out of the 2015 nuclear deal. He has labelled Iran a “terrorist nation”. \nIt would thus be logical for Trump to seek Russia’s backing in his war of attrition with Iran. He faces two main obstacles. One is Russian pragmatism. Putin might be tempted by American recognition of Russia’s leading role in the Middle East (and a continuing free hand in Syria). But concern about the region-wide havoc the unpredictable Trump might wreak will give him pause. \nThe other big obstacle is the searing political toxicity surrounding all White House dealings with Russia, as federal investigators close in. If Trump offered a deal in return for Putin’s support on Iran, it would be seen as further evidence of the collusion he so vehemently denies. It would also finally kill any hope of a peaceful, democratic future for Syria.\n"

        "text": "\nThe Syrian base hit by US missile strikes has played a central part in the war, housing a jet fleet responsible for extensive bombing of the north and large numbers of Hezbollah and Iranian fighters who had turned the conflict in Bashar al-Assad’s favour.\nAll Syrian forces had evacuated the al-Shayrat airfield by the time the strikes occurred, as had fighters from the Lebanese militia, who had been heavily involved in countering an opposition offensive on nearby Hama in recent weeks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n \nThe world reacts to Trump’s Syria airstrikes\n\n\nSources in Beirut said no Hezbollah members had been killed in the attack and some senior Syrian officers had sent their families to Beirut, anticipating further clashes. But politicians allied with Hezbollah said they were not expecting further US involvement, or an escalation of tensions between Washington and Assad’s two main backers, Russia and Iran.\n\nmap\n\nSenior members of Syria’s armed opposition said between 14 and 20 ageing Sukhoi jets had been destroyed in the base – roughly 10% of the Syrian air fleet. Its two runways were damaged, as were storage sites, a weapons dump and an air defence system. \nBut the damage to the runways appears not to have put the base out of action: by Friday, government warplanes were once again reported to have taken off from the runway.\nUp to six people, believed to be civilians, were killed outside the base by shrapnel that flew up to 500 metres, an opposition member said.\nIranian forces had been housed in a nearby hotel in recent months, but they too were evacuated on Thursday night.\nThe Pentagon believes that Russian officers were present inside the sprawling site when a sarin-filled shell was loaded on to one of the Sukhoi jets on the night of 3 April. US intelligence officials have not established, however, whether the Russians knew that the process was happening, or had specific knowledge of the attack.\n\n\n\n\nA visual guide to the US missile strikes on a Syrian airbase\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS military officials also released what they said was a flight path taken by the jet that launched the attack at 6.30am the following morning, which plotted it taking off from the base, then returning to it after manoeuvring over the town of Khan Sheikhun, where more than 70 people were killed in Tuesday’s gas attack.\nWashington used an established channel with Russian commanders to warn of the upcoming strike, which the Russians then relayed to their hosts. Strike planners did not anticipate casualties among Assad’s forces, nor decisive damage to the regime’s air fleet.\nInstead, the bombing was tailored to strike a symbolic blow at the heart of one of Assad’s most strategic bases, which has featured heavily in allegations of chemical use. Western intelligence officials believe the same base was used to launch a sarin attack in eastern Hama in early December, where up to 93 people were killed and more than 300 others suffered the same symptoms as the survivors of the attack on Khan Sheikhun.\nThe small town is at the first major junction on the highway north of Hama. Further north lies the city of Idlib, from where the opposition launched an extensive attack on Hama in mid March. Officials in Beirut believe the sarin attack may have been launched both to avenge the Hama offensive and to clear a way for an eventual regime push towards Idlib.\n\n\n\n\n'The dead were wherever you looked': inside Syrian town after chemical attack\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Guardian visited Khan Sheikhun on Thursday and saw the impact point of the shell that contained sarin – a hole on a road metres away from where dozens of those who died in the attack had been asleep in their homes.\nBuildings near the site had not been damaged by recent air strikes, directly contradicting Russia’s claims that a jihadist weapons depot had been hit, causing a release of sarin claimed to have been stored there. The Guardian inspected all surrounding commercial buildings. All contained small stores of agricultural goods; none of the sites had been contaminated.\nKhan Sheikhun was again bombed on Friday by jets, believed to be Syrian. One senior western official said the decision to launch the strike had likely been driven by local battlefield dynamics, rather than regional political considerations.\n“This is vengeance for the regime for what happened in Hama,” the official said. “This is them saying that they are the most ruthless force in the game, that they will hit 10 times harder than anyone who hits them. It is also about trying to open up a path to Idlib, for the eventual ground attack there.\n“But they badly miscalculated. Somebody didn’t work out that it would be easy to get samples to the border to prove what happened. This was never going to remain shrouded in mystery.”\nAnother opposition supporter, who had been extensively involved in arming the opposition earlier in the war, said: “[The regime] are really quite old school. They have not evolved in their thinking at all. This is about projection of power to them. The more brutal, the better. Anything to incite fear. Obama was never speaking their language by trying to negotiate. They will never negotiate in good faith.”\nOfficials in Beirut and Turkey said there was little risk of an escalation and that the “free hand” that Assad had perceived he had no longer applied after the US strike.\n“That’s the best we can hope for,” said an Ankara-based diplomat. “He will have to think very carefully about what he does from here. He is dealing with an unpredictable and volatile US president. That in itself removes the impunity.”\n"

Tuesday’s event was attended by high-ranking Russian officials including Vladimir Medinsky, the culture minister, and Petr Biryukov, Moscow’s deputy mayor.\n“This is Russia’s cultural brand,” said Medinsky, before a Russian Orthodox priest blessed the statue. \n“He created this weapon to defend his motherland,” said Father Konstantin, shrugging off suggestions that it was inappropriate to sprinkle holy water on a statue of a weapons designer. Some members of the crowd crossed themselves as the priest blessed the monument. \nA guard of honour from the Russian defence ministry stood to attention throughout the ceremony, which also featured second world war-era military songs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Statue of Mikhail Kalashnikov in unveiled in Moscow.

The first model was produced in 1947, earning Kalashnikov the Stalin prize and the Order of the Red Star.\nToday, there are reported to be more than 100m Kalashnikov rifles in use worldwide. The weapon, which is favoured by both armies and militants, is said to be responsible for 250,000 deaths annually.

But it should not be erected here, now, and in this shape.”\nA second sculpture behind the Kalashnikov monument depicts the Archangel Mikhail slaying a dragon with a spear. Salavat Shcherbakov, the artist responsible for both works, said the spear symbolises an AK-47. \n“This represents the victory of good over the forces of evil,” said Shcherbakov, who also created a controversial 17-metre statue of Prince Vladimir the Great that was erected opposite the Kremlin in November.\n"

        "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/13/irans-syria-project-pushing-population-shifts-to-increase-influence",
        "text": "\nIn the valleys between Damascus and Lebanon, where whole communities had abandoned their lives to war, a change is taking place. For the first time since the conflict broke out, people are starting to return.\nBut the people settling in are not the same as those who fled during the past six years.\nThe new arrivals have a different allegiance and faith to the predominantly Sunni Muslim families who once lived there. They are, according to those who have sent them, the vanguard of a move to repopulate the area with Shia Muslims not just from elsewhere in Syria, but also from Lebanon and Iraq.\nThe population swaps are central to a plan to make demographic changes to parts of Syria, realigning the country into zones of influence that backers of Bashar al-Assad, led by Iran, can directly control and use to advance broader interests. Iran is stepping up its efforts as the heat of the conflict starts to dissipate and is pursuing a very different vision to Russia, Assad’s other main backer.\nRussia, in an alliance with Turkey, is using a nominal ceasefire to push for a political consensus between the Assad regime and the exiled opposition. Iran, meanwhile, has begun to move on a project that will fundamentally alter the social landscape of Syria, as well as reinforcing the Hezbollah stronghold of north-eastern Lebanon, and consolidating its influence from Tehran to Israel’s northern border.\n“Iran and the regime don’t want any Sunnis between Damascus and Homs and the Lebanese border,” said one senior Lebanese leader. “This represents a historic shift in populations.”\nKey for Iran are the rebel-held towns of Zabadani and Madaya, where Damascus residents took summer breaks before the war. Since mid-2015 their fate has been the subject of prolonged negotiations between senior Iranian officials and members of Ahrar al-Sham, the dominant anti-Assad opposition group in the area and one of the most powerful in Syria.\nTalks in Istanbul have centred on a swap of residents from two Shia villages west of Aleppo, Fua and Kefraya, which have both been bitterly contested over the past three years. Opposition groups, among them jihadis, had besieged both villages throughout the siege of Aleppo, attempting to tie their fate to the formerly rebel-held eastern half of the city.\nThe swap, according to its architects, was to be a litmus test for more extensive population shifts, along the southern approaches to Damascus and in the Alawite heartland of Syria’s north-west, from where Assad draws much of his support.\n\nMap\n\nLabib al-Nahas, the chief of foreign relations for Ahrar al-Sham, who led negotiations in Istanbul, said Tehran was seeking to create areas it could control. “Iran was very ready to make a full swap between the north and south. They wanted a geographical continuation into Lebanon. Full sectarian segregation is at the heart of the Iranian project in Syria. They are looking for geographical zones that they can fully dominate and influence. This will have repercussions on the entire region.\n“[The sieges of] Madaya and Zabadani became the key issue to prevent the opposition from retaking Fua and Kefraya, which have exclusive populations of Shia. Hezbollah consider this a security zone and a natural extension of their territory in Lebanon. They have had very direct orders from the spiritual leadership of Iran to protect them at any cost.”\nIran has been especially active around all four towns through its Hezbollah proxies. Along the ridgelines between Lebanon’s Bekaa valley and into the outskirts of Damascus, Hezbollah has been a dominant presence, laying siege to Madaya and Zabadani and reinforcing the Syrian capital. Wadi Barada to the north-west, where ongoing fighting is in breach of the Russian-brokered ceasefire, is also part of the calculations, sources within the Lebanon-based movement have confirmed.\nElsewhere in Syria, demographic swaps are also reshaping the geopolitical fabric of communities that, before the war, had coexisted for centuries. In Darayya, south-west of Damascus, more than 300 Iraqi Shia families moved into neighbourhoods abandoned by rebels last August as part of a surrender deal. Up to 700 rebel fighters were relocated to Idlib province and state media announced within days that the Iraqis had arrived.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  The Sayeda Zainab mosque has been heavily fortified by Hezbollah. Photograph: Kaveh Kazemi/Getty Images\n\n\nShia shrines in Darayya and Damascus have been a raison d’etre for the presence of Hezbollah and other Iranian-backed Shia groups. The Sayeda Zainab mosque on the capital’s western approach has been heavily fortified by Hezbollah and populated by families of the militant group, who have moved in since late 2012. Tehran has also bought large numbers of homes near the Zainab mosque, and a tract of land, which it is using to create a security buffer – a microcosm of its grander project.\nAbu Mazen Darkoush, a former FSA commander who fled Zabadani for Wadi Barada said Damascus’s largest Islamic shrine, the Umayyad mosque, was now also a security zone controlled by Iranian proxies. “There are many Shia who were brought into the area around the mosque. It is a Sunni area but they plan for it to be secured by Shias, then surrounded by them.”\nSenior officials in neighbouring Lebanon have been monitoring what they believe has been a systematic torching of Land Registry offices in areas of Syria recaptured on behalf of the regime. A lack of records make it difficult for residents to prove home ownership. Offices are confirmed to have been burned in Zabadani, Darayya, Syria’s fourth city, Homs, and Qusayr on the Lebanese border, which was seized by Hezbollah in early 2013.\nDarkoush said whole neighbourhoods had been cleansed of their original inhabitants in Homs, and that many residents had been denied permission to return to their homes, with officials citing lack of proof that they had indeed lived there.\n“The first step in the plan has been achieved,” he said. “It involved expelling the inhabitants of these areas and burning up anything which connects them to their land and homes. The second step will be replacing the original inhabitants with newcomers from Iraq and Lebanon.”\nIn Zabadani, Amir Berhan, director of the town’s hospital, said: “The displacement from here started in 2012 but increased dramatically in 2015. Now most of our people have already been taken to Idlib. There is a clear and obvious plan to move Sunnis from between Damascus and Homs. They have burned their homes and fields. They are telling people ‘this place is not for you anymore’.\n“This is leading to the fragmentation of families. The concept of family life and ties to the land is being dissolved by all this deportation and exile. It is shredding Syrian society.”\nAt stake in postwar Syria, with the war beginning to ebb, is more than who lives where when the fighting finally stops. A sense of identity is also up for grabs, as is the bigger question of who gets to define the national character.\n“This is not just altering the demographic balance,” said Labib al-Nahas. “This is altering the balance of influence in all of these areas and across Syria itself. Whole communities will be vulnerable. War with Iran is becoming an identity war. They want a country in their likeness, serving their interests. The region can’t tolerate that.”\nAdditional reporting by Suzan Haidamous\n"

        "text": "\nHezbollah says it will soon reveal who it believes killed its military commander, Mustafa Badreddine, in a large explosion in Syria, the biggest blow to the militant Lebanese group in the past eight years.\nAhead of the findings of an investigation launched by Hezbollah members at the scene of the explosion near Damascus airport, leaders of the political bloc cum powerful militia were on Friday already pointing the finger of blame at Israel.\nA statement by the group gave weight to the suggestion, by announcing that the internal investigation would seek to determine whether a “missile or artillery strike” had been responsible.\nBadreddine, 55, was the most senior Hezbollah member to have been killed since his predecessor and brother-in-law Imad Mughniyeh was assassinated in Damascus in February 2008 in a joint Mossad and CIA operation.\nSince then Badreddine had led all aspects of the organisation’s activities, including the war in Syria, in which Hezbollah became a major stakeholder in 2012 as a backer of the Bashar al-Assad regime.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Hezbollah members hold a picture of Badreddine during his funeral. Photograph: Nabil Mounzer/EPA\n\n\nReaction in Israel to the strike was muted, while Israeli media that had been briefed by officials steered away from the suggestion of government involvement.\n\n\n\n\nMustafa Badreddine: a long, violent career won him many enemies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd while in the past Israel has not acknowledged operations of this kind until long after the fact, they have often been accompanied by mood music suggesting responsibility. Speculation has so far centred on who else might have done it. \nHezbollah has many enemies in Syria, where it has lost an estimated 900 members in fighting and where, along with Iran, it has taken the lead in directing numerous battles.\nOn the streets of Beirut, there was little room for doubt. Thousands of Hezbollah supporters gathered on Friday to pay homage to Badreddine, who was buried with full military honours and a marching band.\nResidents of south Beirut showered mourners with flowers and rice and ululated as they sang eulogies for Badreddine, chanting death to America, Israel and the Saudi ruling family. Badreddine was buried in the same shrine as Mughniyah. Top Hezbollah officials attended the procession, as well as Badreddine’s brother.\n“The people of the resistance are used to these shocks but we are proud of him,” said one Hezbollah supporter. “We will march on. It is incredible to have a leader willing to sacrifice in this way, though we knew little of him.”\n“We are all in one field of battle and in the end we win either victory or martyrdom,” another said.\nIsrael has sent its air force to attack at least eight different sites inside Syria since the civil war began. Most have targeted what Israeli officials believe to have been convoys carrying anti-aircraft missiles, which they claimed were being moved to Lebanon, where they could pose a threat against its air force.\n\nMap: death of Mustafa Badreddine\n\nAnnouncing Badreddine’s death earlier on Friday, Hezbollah said: “He said months ago that he would not return from Syria except as a martyr or carrying the flag of victory. “He is the great jihadi leader Mustafa Badreddine, and he has returned today a martyr.\n“The information gleaned from the initial investigation is that a major explosion targeted one of our centres near Damascus international airport, which led to the martyrdom of Sayyid Zul Fikar (a nom de guerre for Badreddine) and the injuries of others. \n\n\n\n\nMustafa Badreddine: a long, violent career won him many enemies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The investigation will work to determine the nature of the explosion and its causes, whether it was due to an air or missile or artillery strike and we will announce the results of the investigation soon.”\nBorn in 1961 in the southern Beirut suburb of Ghobeiry, Badreddine had been central to Hezbollah’s operations since the group’s inception in 1982. He was sentenced to death in Kuwait in the 1980s over a plot to blow up the American and French embassies there during the Iran-Iraq war, but later escaped after Saddam Hussein’s army invaded the oil-rich emirate and threw open its prisons.\nMost of the organisation’s activities had targeted Israel, which occupied southern Lebanon from 1982 to 2000. However, Badreddine had also been accused of leading a cell that was allegedly responsible for the assassination of the former Lebanese prime minister Rafiq Hariri, on the Beirut waterfront in February 2005.\nHe was indicted in 2011 by the special tribunal for Lebanon, an international court established in The Hague, in connection with the massive 2005 bombing, which led Assad to withdraw his forces from Lebanon in the face of a civic uprising.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Badreddine in at picture released by the special tribunal for Lebanon website. Photograph: Reuters\n\n\nBadreddine and four other alleged members of Hezbollah remain on trial in absentia at The Hague. Prosecutors have offered one of the few publicly available glimpses of the shadowy Hezbollah operative, describing him as the “apex” of the cell that allegedly killed Hariri, and a figure who was akin to an “untraceable ghost” who assumed multiple identities.\nHe was known to have studied at a Lebanese university and to have maintained an apartment in the Lebanese seaside area of Jounieh. He was also active in the south Beirut suburb of Dahiyeh, where he was last seen early last year at a wake for Jihad Mughniyeh, the son of Imad Mughniyeh, who was killed by an Israeli airstrike that also claimed an Iranian general.\nWhile holding senior positions throughout his career, Badreddine was best known for his role in leading Hezbollah’s large contingent in Syria.\nDespite Israeli protests, Russia recently proceeded with a long-delayed sale to Iran of the advanced S-300 weapons system, which can shoot down the most modern fighter jets. Israeli officials had said they would prioritise tracking the whereabouts of the systems, the position of which in southern Lebanon would pose a potent threat to their air force.\n"

        "text": "\nFrom the balconies in east Beirut we looked toward the west, listening to the gunfire. It was the third night of the conflict and we were locked down in a hostel. All the foreigners had the same fixed grins, drinking Almaza beer, sharing cigarettes and furtive trips through the dead streets to ATMs for emergency cash. The owner was an old, bald Christian, and his family had arrived to support him – a son and daughter-in-law with a baby, various aunts.\nWe all holed up together in the lounge, flinching at the gunshots and checking our emails. As the old Christian drank, he got playful. Soon he dressed up and began to dance. He put on a red fez, and pulled out a plastic cat o’ nine tails, before dancing around the room, playfully whipping himself, moaning merrily in imitation of the Shia festival of Ashura. His family applauded. It was the whole Lebanese farce enacted for us. Over six days in May 2008, 84 people were killed and nearly 200 wounded.\nIt became known as the “little war”. The Shia militia Hezbollah was taking over most of west Beirut by force of arms after government “encroachment” on their private telecoms network and the firing of their security chief at Beirut airport. As we sat and smiled at the Christian’s little play, Hezbollah was adjusting the physical and political map outside. \nThis was eight years ago, before the Syrian civil war. Now there are 1.5 million Syrian refugees in Lebanon, as well as half a million Palestinian refugees. Between 2011 and 2014, about 34,000 paperless and stateless Syrian babies were born in Lebanon. This means, with a population the same as my home country New Zealand (4.4 million), more than one in three people in Lebanon is a refugee – the highest per capita refugee population in the world. The last time this many refugees entered the country – about half a million Palestinians after 1948 – Lebanon held on for a long time before the 15-year civil war savaged it beyond recognition.\n“Beyond recognition” may be a a cliche, but it is also the truth. Lebanon is a thousand-year evolving project. The Lebanese are fiercely proud of their country – but at the same time, its compromises, volatility, shockingly porous borders and corruption are sources of embarrassment and great dismay.\nWhen I got out of Beirut during the little war, I did so jammed in the back of an ancient Buick taxi with six or seven others, including the Danish boyfriend of a girl studying in Beirut who stayed on. Ironically, we fled into Syria. A merry Lebanese businessman from Kuwait bribed a Syrian border guard for us, then promptly took us all to dinner.\nWith my New Zealand passport, I could cross the border quite easily, like a ghost – and I did. I think about the businessman and the border guard often. That kindness, where they are now, what that Syrian guard has done as his people passed the other way. I saw the Danish boy from the taxi in Damascus a day later, wearing a yellow Hezbollah T-shirt. Who did he think he was? Who did I think I was?\nWhen I crossed into Israel a few days after leaving Syria it was via the Allenby Bridge, over the few metres of sludge that comprises that part of the Jordan River. A Jordanian shuttle bus dropped us at a large kiosk near the bridge, where we were asked if we wanted our Allenby visas stamped on a piece of paper rather than our passports, so we might discard them if we ever wished to enter an Arab country. We were then ushered on to a huge, plush Mercedes bus to drop us on the Israeli side. On the mesas above us, ragged plastic bags opaque with age were snagged on the razor wire, flapping in the wind like flags.\nThe foreigners and the Arabs were divided into different streams. Because of my travel history I was questioned at length by Shin Bet. I’d seen them – handsome young men and women, in cargo pants and polo shirts – yelling at the ancient Arab grandmothers lugging heavy plastic jerrycans of Zamzam water back from the Hajj. When did you come to Lebanon? Who did you meet there? Why did you go to Syria? The questions circled and returned, always politely prefaced with: “I’m sorry we have to ask you these questions.” The Arab queues were Boschian; soon, I was eating schnitzel in Tel Aviv.\n\n\n\n\nLiving off-grid in India, am I the only one left who believes in globalisation?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Lebanon, under pressures we cannot imagine, there remains – for now – a kind of peace. But foreign aid is falling. The numbers of unregistered refugees are growing. Isolationism will not help those 34,000 babies, those true citizens of nowhere, and they will grow up. \nThe great Lebanese experiment is often seen as a bellwether for the Middle East and the world. In some sense, and the long view, it is an experiment of continually searching for the compromise that prevents conflict – searching for a citizenship of something higher. Coexistence. In Lebanon, one of the fundamental conditions of that experiment is simple proximity – they recognise the true imperatives of a situation where we have to live together. We might learn from that, and help. \n• The author is donating his fee for this article to The White Helmets.

        "text": "\nA senior Israeli cabinet minister, tipped as the country’s next prime minister, has accused the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party of being antisemitic.\nOn a visit to Brussels, Gilad Erdan, Israel’s public security minister, said his government had become concerned by the views expressed by figures in the highest echelons of the Labour party.\n“We recognise and we see that there are antisemitic views in many of the leadership of the current Labour party,” Erdan said. “We hope it will be changed. The views. \n“That they will come to the right decisions about people in their party who don’t understand that Hamas is a recognised terror organisation, that you cannot have a regular relationship with a terror organisation.”\nAsked specifically whether he was suggesting Corbyn himself was an antisemite, the Israeli minister paused, before adding: “I didn’t say it. I said there are views that are very close to antisemitism in the leadership of the Labour party today in the UK.”\nThis summer Corbyn told MPs investigating accusations of antisemitism in the Labour party that he regretted once calling members of Hamas and Hezbollah “friends”.\nAfter a speaker at a fringe meeting at the Labour conference claimed free speech should include the right to question the Holocaust, Corbyn undertook a series of interviews to insist that antisemitism was “completely at odds with the beliefs of this party”.\nErdan was in Brussels to lobby key European parliament figures to stop funding for groups campaigning for boycotts of Israeli goods. \nThe minister, who is the second most senior in Benjamin Netanyahu’s Likud party, added that a review last year of antisemitism carried out by Shami Chakrabarti, the former director of the civil rights group Liberty, who was later given a peerage at the suggestion of the Labour leader, had been “empty”.\nThe inquiry, which followed the suspension of the MP Naz Shah and the former London mayor Ken Livingstone amid antisemitism claims, had found an “occasionally toxic atmosphere”.\nErdan said: “We don’t think this committee was enough. We still follow and listen to their views and we are concerned that it will lead, it will bring, the UK to a very, very negative place. Still we are optimistic.”\nLast month, the historians Simon Schama and Simon Sebag Montefiore, and the Booker prize winner Howard Jacobson, wrote a letter published in the Times expressing their concern over the “tone and direction of debate about Israel and Zionism” in the Labour party.\nErdan also offered his support for the former international development secretary Priti Patel, who was forced to resign after undertaking a series of unauthorised meetings with senior Israeli government figures while on holiday and back in London.\nErdan, who met Patel in one of those meetings in Westminster, and posed with her for photographs on the Commons terrace, said the British government would be diminished by Patel’s dismissal from the cabinet. \n“The Brits have something to lose here as well,” he said. “In Israel I must tell you it takes much, much more to leave the government.” Erdan, a former adviser to Netanyahu, is understood to have ambitions to replace the Israeli prime minister, who is currently under police investigation over allegations of corruption.\nA spokesman for the Labour party said: “Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour party campaign against and condemn all forms of antisemitism and the Labour party conference recently adopted new tough rules on antisemitism.”\n"

        "text": "\nMohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, is a young man in a hurry. So, too, is Jared Kushner, Donald Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser. Together, they make a dangerous combination. By all accounts, the two men have become firm friends, forging a strong bond melding youth and power. Kushner, 36, made his third visit to Saudi Arabia this year at the end of October. He reportedly talked late into the night with Salman, 32, at the latter’s desert ranch.\nShortly after the meeting, three things happened: Salman began a sweeping purge of wealthy royal rivals; he launched a silent coup in Lebanon; and the Saudi armed forces imposed an aid blockade on Yemeni ports, which (though now partly eased) threatens a humanitarian catastrophe. The White House, supportive of its Saudi friends, made no criticism. Trump tweeted support for the purge. Thanks in part to Kushner, his first foreign trip was to Riyadh, where he was feted by the autocratic regime. He feels a connection.\nThe strong links between Salman, the de facto Saudi ruler, and the influential Kushner, Trump’s personal overseas troubleshooter and Middle East envoy, are nevertheless a big worry for American diplomats and the Pentagon. Officials told the New York Times they were not briefed on the Salman-Kushner talks. Such secretiveness is apparently the norm. “Jared is a bit of a black hole. There is no sense of the positions he has advocated. We can only guess, based on what he has done and where he has been,” an official said. “The Saudis have been very careful to cultivate him and bring him along.”\nHow the US under Trump runs its foreign policy is its own business. But when reckless, impulsive and confrontational actions, destabilising the world’s most volatile region, are the result, it’s a problem for everyone. That is what is happening now. As defence minister in 2015, Salman launched the military intervention in Yemen. Its aims were to defeat Shia Muslim Houthi rebels and reduce Iranian influence. It has failed miserably in both. What is has done is turn one of the world’s poorest countries into a killing ground, ravaged by violence, disease and malnutrition.\nUN relief organisations warned last week that millions could perish. Save the Children said an estimated 130 Yemeni children are dying every day. More than 50,000 children are believed to have died this year alone – an horrific figure that, coming on the eve of World Children’s Day tomorrow, is deeply shaming.\nAs Clive Myrie’s graphic BBC television reports last week suggested, the disaster in Yemen is as unacceptable as it is avoidable. But Saudi actions, including alleged crimes against humanity, pass unchallenged by Kushner and a collusional Trump administration.\nVisceral Saudi fear of its great regional rival, Iran, lies at the heart of Salman’s many foreign policy miscalculations and mistakes – the cause of growing alarm among western allies, oil buyers and arms suppliers. A furious row has erupted with Germany over Riyadh’s alleged role in forcing the resignation of Lebanon’s prime minister, Sa’ad Hariri, over his refusal to crack down on Iran-backed Hezbollah. Hariri, who his supporters claim was kidnapped by the Saudis, has now taken refuge in Paris.\nCircumventing the White House’s silence on Lebanon, Rex Tillerson, the US secretary of state, warned last week the country must not become “a venue for proxy conflicts”. His implied criticism of Riyadh as well as Tehran was significant. France and Germany, mindful of the blockade against Qatar that Salman imposed earlier this year over its links to Tehran, have expressed similar concerns about a widening arc of instability. As Sigmar Gabriel, Germany’s foreign minister, reportedly put it: “Another troublespot is the last thing people in the Middle East need now.”\nSalman’s campaign of attrition in Yemen even provoked a mild rebuke from Britain’s foreign office last week, which called for “immediate access for commercial and humanitarian supplies”. This was unusual, given the British government’s habitual subservience to Riyadh. Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, may have ulterior motives. He is in deep trouble over his mishandling of the case of the wrongly imprisoned British-Iranian woman, Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe. Johnson is due to visit Tehran soon. Perhaps he hopes to curry favour before he arrives.\nThe sclerotic House of Saud has been viewed historically in the west as a necessary if unattractive force for stability in the Middle East. The biggest criticisms concerned its undemocratic governance, its appalling record on human and civil rights and the ultra-conservative nature of the regime, notably its role in the propagation of Sunni fundamentalism and jihadist ideology. But Salman’s Saudi is increasingly viewed in quite a different light: as an unpredictable, dangerous loose cannon proficient at starting or fuelling conflicts it cannot finish. Its many failings now look less tolerable.\nSaudi Arabia is under pressure not just from Iran’s ambitions but also from falling oil revenues, shrinking national wealth and mounting demands for reform. Big changes are undoubtedly required – and in train. Salman’s foolish, headstrong behaviour, sanctioned by his unaccountable pal in the White House, risks it all.\n"

        "text": "\nLebanese MPs have elected a staunch ally of Iran as president, ending a paralysing two-year standoff rooted in a broader rivalry between Tehran and Saudi Arabia.\nThe appointment of retired general Michel Aoun, 81, came after he gained the backing of the former Lebanese prime minister Saad al-Hariri, Riyadh’s preferred leader, and further edges the balance of power in the region towards Iran and its allies.\n\n\n\n\nMustafa Badreddine: the Hezbollah leader who left no footprints\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pact also politically legitimises Hezbollah as a nationalist group with cross-sectarian support – a landmark moment for an organisation that had largely been defined by its sectarian origins.\nDemonstrations in support of Aoun were held in the Hezbollah-dominated southern suburbs of Beirut, and on the streets of Damascus, where the regime of Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad had also strongly backed the new president’s candidacy.\nAt his swearing-in in the Beirut parliament building, Aoun said Lebanon must be protected from “regional fires” - a reference to the conflict in neighbouring Syria where Hezbollah is fighting in support of Assad, but did not set out a position on the conflict. “It remains a priority to prevent any sparks from reaching Lebanon,” Aoun said after taking the presidential oath.\nSaudi Arabia had been vehemently opposed to Aoun’s nomination, fearing he will consolidate Iran’s influence on the brittle state, which has remained vulnerable state since the end of its destructive civil war 25 years ago.\nSenior Saudi officials had sponsored Hariri as a rival power base to Hezbollah, urging him to oppose the powerful militant group and political bloc, which has played an increasingly prominent role in Lebanese and regional affairs.\nHowever, over the past year Saudi confidence in Hariri had waned, as had his efforts to draft a rival candidate, Sleiman Frangieh, as president.\nThe billionaire businessman’s fortunes and domestic support also dipped sharply, and Hariri is now expected to return to the role of prime minister, from which he was ousted in 2011, capping a difficult five years largely spent in exile.\nHezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, said he would not oppose Hariri being named as prime minister and called for the Lebanese people to accept Aoun’s election. Nasrallah has backed Aoun for more than two years , meeting regularly to discuss developments in Lebanon and Syria, where Hezbollah is heavily engaged in a battle to support the Syrian leader.\nAoun’s run towards Monday’s parliamentary vote began on 6 February 2006, when he and Nasrallah signed a pact based on him eventually becoming president. Aoun’s political bloc, which accounts for roughly half of Lebanon’s Christian population, aligned its strategic interests with Hezbollah, and united against the political weight of Hariri’s Sunni-dominated Future bloc.\nSaudi Arabia, meanwhile, has been in steady retreat from Lebanon. It withdrew its ambassador in September and cancelled funding for the Lebanese military. Before Monday’s vote, Riyadh sent a senior envoy to consult Lebanese officials in what was seen as a tacit approval of the pivot to Aoun, as well as an increasing disengagement from Lebanese affairs.\nThough largely ceremonial in Lebanon, the president appoints the cabinet and influences foreign policy. The Lebanese constitution stipulates that the president must be a Maronite, the prime minister a Sunni Muslim and the speaker of the parliament a Shia Muslim.\nAoun has remained a contentious figure in Lebanon since the civil war, when he served as military commander and stood against the Syrian occupation. \nHe served briefly as prime minister of one of the two rival governments established near the war’s end. Besieged by Syrian troops, he sought refuge in the French embassy and fled to Paris, where he remained in exile for close to 15 years until Syrian troops were forced to flee Lebanon after the assassination of their former leader Rafiq Hariri.\nAoun remained a staunch critic of the Syrian regime. However, his position shifted after he returned to Lebanon, where he became a powerful political presence. He soon won the patronage of Iran, setting his sights on the country’s highest office and tailoring his message to suit Tehran.\n"

Tehran ferociously denied the charge.\n\n\n\n\nSaudi Arabia accuses Iran of 'direct aggression' over Yemen missile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimmering tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia, two regional rivals at opposing ends of the Yemen conflict, have ratcheted up after the launch of a ballistic missile from Yemen towards Riyadh on Saturday. The missile was intercepted and debris fell at Riyadh’s international airport.\n“Why are you showing hostility towards the people of Syria and Iraq? Why are you strengthening Isis and leaving the peoples of the region with them? Why are you interfering with Lebanon’s internal affairs and governance?” Rouhani said, referring to the resignation on Saturday of Saad Hariri, Lebanon’s prime minister, who unexpectedly stepped down as prime minister while he was visiting Saudi Arabia. \nHariri’s resignation was announced in a televised address from Riyadh, during which he said Iran was controlling the region. He blamed Lebanon’s powerful Shia militant group and political movement Hezbollah of exerting full control in the country.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Saad Hariri, who has resigned as Lebanon’s prime minister.

This is an unprecedented event in history. Where are you going in this way?”\nHezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, said that Hariri’s resignation was “a Saudi decision”.\nThe Iranian president said Riyadh was not in a position to threaten Iran, saying that “those bigger than you have not been able to do anything against the Iranian nation”.\n\n\n\n\nThe House of Saud is still in denial | Nesrine Malik\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIran has formally protested to the UN security council about the Saudi accusations over the missile launch and threats to retaliate militarily, saying they were based on “unfounded assumptions”. \nIt said the claims were an attempt to “shift the blame and to distract attention from [Saudi’s] war of aggression against Yemen” and that Riyadh was “committing war crimes” by striking the Arab world’s poorest nation and also imposing a blockade on aid access to the famine-stricken country. He said Saudis were behind “blind attacks and murdering of Yemeni innocent people”. \nSince March 2015 Saudi Arabia has led a US-backed military intervention in Yemen, aimed at reinstating the ousted president, who lives in exile in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, and at countering advances of Iran-backed Houthi rebels.\nIran has denied any military backing of the Houthis, who control Sana’a, the capital of Yemen, as well as large swaths of the country.\nSaudi Arabia’s military intervention has been criticised for its civilian casualties. Houthis, who have seized power without election, have also been blamed for exacerbating the conflict. \nRouhani said Saudi officials were making a “strategic mistake” by considering the US and “the Zionist regime”, Iran’s terminology for Israel, as allies. He said the US and Israel were trying to dominate the region to “plunder its oil and wealth” and that Donald Trump’s administration was “skilful in pickpocketing” Saudi Arabia. \n“Today, the question is that what benefits has Saudi Arabia’s animosity towards the peoples of the region got for it?” he said. \nRouhani defended Iran’s role in Iraq and Syria, saying: “Iran is accused of interfering in the region, while it is helping Iraq and Syria to fight terrorism on their own request and we are proud that we were able to stop Isis from reaching its goals.”\nThe White House said on Wednesday: “We condemn the Iranian regime’s activities and stand with Saudi Arabia.”\n It accused Iran of “perpetuating the war in Yemen to advance its regional ambitions” and said Houthi missile attacks “enabled by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps threaten regional security and undermine UN efforts to negotiate an end to the conflict”.\n"

        "text": "\nNo one doubted that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was a man in a hurry. But the Saudi royal’s decision to arrest 11 princes, four ministers and dozens of former ministers shows he is a risk-taker on a scale the Middle East has rarely seen. \nThe fact that the billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, who owns the investment firm Kingdom Holding, was among the wave of late-night arrests (and is thought to be held in the luxurious confines of Riyadh’s Ritz Carlton hotel) suggests MBS, as Salman is known colloquially, is willing to take on the kingdom’s most powerful figures to implement his reforms and consolidate power.\n\n\n\n\nRoyal purge sends shockwaves through Saudi Arabia's elites\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn theory, MBS could be in power for a half a century. The question is whether he is showing the maturity and steadiness to use such a lengthy reign to create a viable, modern Saudi Arabia.\nThe crown prince will say the arrests show his determination to root out corruption, a precondition of a more open economy. But few think the arrests, and related ministerial sackings, are the independent decision of a new corruption body, established just hours before to replace an existing one, rather than part of a wider reshuffle to centralise all security authority under MBS.\nThe speed and unpredictability with which the crown prince acts – the purge was undertaken in great secrecy in the early hours of Sunday morning – is part of a pattern of behaviour unlikely to reassure international investors and interlocutors. \nAfter all, MBS effectively seized power in a palace coup in June, ousting his elder cousin Mohammad bin Nayef as heir to the throne and interior minister. Since then, the pace of reform has been breathtaking, and contradictory. \nWomen are to be given the right to drive next year, cinemas are to be opened, tourists welcomed and the role of clerics driven back as part of a cultural and social revolution designed to make the secretive kingdom closer to the model of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and tprepare the economy for life after oil. \nThe prince is launching a huge sale of state assets, and the UK and US are falling over each other to handle the $2tn (£1.52tn) float of Saudi Aramco, which could raise as much as $100bn for Saudi Arabia. \nThis cash is to be used to build a new capitalist megacity, the extraordinary plans for which were unveiled last week. Many of the Saudi businessmen present at the unveiling are now locked up in the Ritz Carlton, with their phones cut off not just from room service, but their lawyers.\nMBS has been equally bold in his foreign policy, determined to curb Shia Iran and marginalise Saudi’s Sunni rival Qatar. Saudi has launched an unending and brutal war in Yemen designed to quell the Iranian-backed Houthis. A missile was launched towards Riyadh this weekend in a sign of how the Saudis are struggling to secure a military victory.\nIn June, MBS imposed a politically costly economic boycott on Qatar that has lost it allies in Europe and Washington. This weekend, the Sunni leader in Lebanon, Saad Hariri, under pressure from MBS, quit as prime minister in order to isolate Hezbollah and deepen the conflict with Iran. \nIn addition, the Saudis are trying to force the weakened Syrian opposition to rein back its demands to end the civil war, in what looks like an uneasy alliance with Russia. \n It is a programme of social, economic and political reform, largely backed by the UAE, that amounts to a revolution in one of the most conservative countries in the world. The test is whether MBS has taken on too much at once. His latest purge is a sign that he knows opposition is gathering, and believes the educated population, liberated by social media, want reforms to go faster, and those holding back change must be ruthlesslyset aside. \nThe list of the latest detainees is breathtaking – the equivalent of Theresa May sacking half her cabinet. As well as Prince al-Waleed, the roll call includes the former finance minister Ibrahim al-Assaf, a board member of national oil giant Saudi Aramco; the economy minister Adel Fakieh, who once played a major role in drafting reforms; the former Riyadh governor Prince Turki bin Abdullah; and Khalid al-Tuwaijiri, who headed the royal court under the late King Abdullah. \nBakr bin Laden, chairman of the Saudi Binladin construction group, and Alwaleed al-Ibrahim, owner of the MBC television network, were also detained. \nStock markets have recovered from the shock of the arrests, and MBS is the last man standing. But the reverberations of Saturday’s night of the long knives may just be starting.\n"

In September he tweeted: “Going to the White House is considered a great honor for a championship team, Stephen Curry is hesitating, therefore invitation is withdrawn!”\nKerr said the visit had been debated for some time by players and staff. “We had been debating for a couple months what we would do in terms of visiting the White House, if we would or not, how it would unfold,” Kerr said on the Pod Save America podcast on Monday.\n\n\n\n\nTrump in angry row with sports stars after withdrawing Warriors invitation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“We were sorting through it all, but before we could get to anything, the President beat us to the punch. I don’t think we would have gone. And I think he knew that. Several of us had been very critical of the president in the past year, and it would have been awkward, for sure.”\nWarriors star Kevin Durant is from DC and Kerr said their visit may instead involve some charitable work in the capital. “We’ve been invited by various members of Congress to visit, so maybe we can do something like that,” Kerr said. “We’ve talked about doing what we usually do in DC, which is visiting one of the many museums or historical sites.”\nKerr also have his thoughts on Colin Kaepernick, who has filed a grievance against the NFL and team owners alleging there has been collusion to keep him out of the league following his protest at social injustice in America. \n“Oh, he is being blackballed. That’s a no-brainer,” Kerr said. “All you have to do is read the transactions every day, when you see the quarterbacks who are being hired. He’s way better than any of them. But the NFL has a different fan base than the NBA. The NBA is more urban, the NFL is more conservative, and I think a lot of NFL fans are truly angry at Kaepernick, and I think owners are worried what it’s going to do to business.”\nKerr has long been a critic of the president. In January he attacked the proposed ban on travellers and refugees from some Muslim-majority countries.\n“I would just say that as someone whose family member was a victim of terrorism, having lost my father, if we’re trying to combat terrorism by banishing people from coming to this country, by really going against the principles of what our country is about and creating fear, it’s the wrong way of going about it,” said Kerr whose father, Malcolm, was killed by two gunmen in 1984 while he was president of the American University of Beirut. Islamic Jihad, a precursor of Hezbollah, later claimed responsibility for the murder. “If anything, we could be breeding anger and terror. So I’m completely against what’s happening.”\n"

        "text": "\nBoris Johnson will travel to Washington next week in a bid to persuade US senators not to abandon the Iran nuclear deal or to impose fresh sanctions against Tehran that could jeopardise the deal.\nWhile describing the deal as an “amazing triumph of diplomacy”, the foreign secretary acknowledged that it had not led to wider changes in Iranian policies in the Middle East, such as in its support for Hezbollah in Lebanon and Houthi rebels in Yemen.\nLast month, Donald Trump threatened to terminate the 2015 deal unless Congress and US allies toughened the conditions on Iran – and to make restrictions on the country’s nuclear programme permanent. \n\n\n Q&A Why is Trump hostile to Iran?  \n\n\n Show \n\n\n Hide  \n\nThe genesis of Trump’s particular antipathy to Iran is hard to pin down.  Before entering office he had been sceptical of Iran’s regional rival, Saudi Arabia. But during the 2016 election campaign all his closest foreign policy advisors, such as Michael Flynn, shared a worldview that portrays Iran as an uniquely malign actor in the Middle East and beyond. After the election, Israel, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates were successful in capturing the ear of Trump and his son-in-law and top adviser Jared Kushner.\n\n\n\n\nWas this helpful?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you for your feedback.\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking to the foreign affairs committee, Johnson said Iran’s behaviour was creating an incredibly dangerous situation, but he said it was vital that America did not respond by “throwing the baby out with the bathwater” by rejecting the deal outright.\nHe said the 80 million Iranians “deserve and need to feel the benefits of both the deal and engagement”, adding that “the International Atomic Energy Authority has found the Iranians in compliance”. The country had a potentially extraordinary future, he said. But he added that perception “should not in any way blind us to the disruptive behaviour of Iran, or have any illusions about what they are up to”.\nHe said it might be possible to take measures to try to constrain Iran, but he did not want any measures to impact the nuclear deal so that it was “no longer viable from the Iranian point of view”. He added he was concerned that further sanctions might also damage the limited economic engagement already under way.\nInsisting that the US-UK channel of communications remained vital, he went out of his way not to criticise Trump’s handling of issue, saying it was significant that he had only refused to recertify the agreement, handing that task to Congress to make a final decision within 60 days. “It was very clever piece of work. He kept the core of the [Iran nuclear deal] intact,” he said. “The fundamental trade-off on good behaviour on nuclear weapons and economic activity remains there, basically.”\nHe added that it was important that any fresh sanctions imposed on Iran went through agreed dispute resolution mechanisms, and were not imposed unilaterally.\nJohnson acknowledged there were aspects of the deal that were going to need to be renegotiated, notably the sunset clause that ends the deal in eight years and could under some interpretation of the agreement allow Iran to possess a nuclear weapon almost as soon as the deal expires.\n\n\n\n\nHusband of Nazanin Zaghari Ratcliffe, jailed in Iran, tells of strain of separation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohnson also condemned Iran’s detention of British citizen Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and even offered to visit her in prison. The foreign secretary has been criticised for refusing to condemn the jailing of the charity worker, who has been held since her arrest by Iran’s Revolutionary Guard in April 2016.\nJohnson attacked Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s conviction for spying as a mockery of justice. “When I look at what Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was doing, she was simply teaching people journalism, as I understand it,” he said. “Neither Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe nor her family has been informed about what crime she has actually committed. And that I find extraordinary, incredible.”\nHe said Iran resembled a Russian doll, with different states such as the Iranian Revolutionary Guards operating inside the state, but the task of the west was to encourage the democratic and civilian elements.\nHe also claimed that in Syria it might be possible to split Moscow from Tehran since Moscow was more eager for a peace deal that might involve western reconstruction money.\n\n\n\n\n'It's become a monster': is Iran's revolutionary guard a terror group?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn his two-day visit to Washington, Johnson is likely to raise the US Treasury’s decision to put massive tariffs on Bombardier aircraft in Northern Ireland as part of a bid to defend its American rival, Boeing. He said the tariffs were neither fair nor reasonable.\nHe said: “No one in the UK should be under any illusion that the US will strike a very hard bargain on a future trade deal”, but that the UK would be in a position to start striking such new deals as soon as it left the EU in 2019, even if it remained in a transition period.\nPrior to leaving the EU, the UK could scope or pencil in free trade deals with third parties, but could not put them in ink, he said. He also mentioned the possibility of the US returning to the Paris climate accord, saying the issue was not a lost cause.\n"

Facebook told the New York Times that it had a “legal obligation” to disable his accounts once they confirmed they were run by someone on a US sanctions list.\n\n\n\n\nRussia calls for answers after Chechen leader's Instagram is blocked\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat legal obligation did not appear to extend to other key individuals on US sanctions lists, including the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro, Syria’s Bashar al-Assad, and Guatemalan congressman Julio Antonio Juárez.\nFacebook declined to explain why it had deleted some accounts but not others under US sanctions law. A company spokeswoman told the Guardian: “We operate under the constraints of US laws, which vary by circumstance.”\n“We will continue to work with appropriate government authorities to ensure we meet our legal obligations and to explore options for complying with the law in a way that maximises free expression on our platform and keeps people safe.” \nThe case has raised concern among civil liberties groups, who worry that economic sanctions imposed by the US, in service of Washington’s foreign policy, are being used to censor political speech.\nUS economic sanctions are enforced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and are typically applied to individuals who pose a threat to America’s national security, whether that’s for alleged human rights abuses, involvement in drug trafficking, illegal arms dealing or terrorism. \nAmerican companies and individuals are prohibited from providing goods, technology or services to people on these sanction lists and people who intentionally violate the law face fines and imprisonment.\n\n\n\n\n \n\nIt seems as though Facebook is picking and choosing compliance, which suggests there is government involvement\n\nJillian York, Electronic Frontier Foundation\n\n\n\n“The law is clearly targeted at economic activity and is being applied to an entirely different category to suppress speech,” said Jennifer Granick, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union.\nThe fact Facebook has left accounts of other sanctioned individuals untouched suggests the social network may be subject to US government pressure behind the scenes. The company, which has a real name policy on its platform, could easily use screening software to ensure that it doesn’t do business with people or companies on OFAC’s sanctions lists. \n“It’s compliance 101,” said one lawyer who specialises in economic sanctions. “Whenever we bring a new client in we screen them against the [sanctions] list. If DC lawyers are capable of doing this, then one of the leading global technology companies would certainly be capable of doing this.”\n“It really does seem as though Facebook is picking and choosing compliance, which suggests there is government involvement,” added Jillian York, director for international freedom of expression at the Electronic Frontier Foundation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Bashar al-Assad at the Kremlin with Vladimir Putin.

        "text": "\nThe imposition of new US sanctions on Iran, only two weeks after the Obama administration left office, has raised fears that Donald Trump is gearing up for a new confrontation by branding Tehran the “champion” of global terror. \nIran has angrily dismissed Trump as inexperienced and dangerous. Iran’s Revolutionary Guards said military units would conduct missile exercises on Saturday to demonstrate their “complete preparedness to deal with threats [and] humiliating sanctions”.\nBut suggestions that Trump is planning unilateral action to scrap or bypass the landmark nuclear deal with Iran, agreed in 2015 by the US, the four other permanent members of the UN security council and the EU, may prove wide of the mark. \nA more likely prospect is a ramping-up of American efforts to characterise Shia Muslim Iran as the world’s headquarters and foremost sponsor of terror and roll back its expanding influence across the Middle East region. The “battlefront” includes Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, Bahrain, Lebanon and Yemen, where Tehran is fighting a proxy war with Saudi Arabia, its chief Sunni Muslim rival.\nTrump’s hostility to Iran has not abated since he singled it out during the presidential campaign. Iranian citizens were included in the US president’s infamous travel ban on seven Muslim-majority countries. Last week Trump’s national security adviser, Michael Flynn, furiously condemned an “illegal” Iranian ballistic missile test. Flynn said the US was putting Iran “on notice” that its behaviour was unacceptable. “The days of turning a blind eye to Iran’s hostile and belligerent actions toward the United States and the world community are over,” he said. \nThe new sanctions announced on Friday are largely symbolic. The White House says they are just a beginning, and that it has launched a strategic review of Iran policy. But the new administration knows an attempt to overturn the nuclear deal would be fiercely opposed by its other signatories. Analysts suggest the US will instead attempt to strengthen the accord by introducing tougher inspections and extending its curbs.\nMeanwhile a new strategic approach is evolving. An indication of its likely focus was contained in remarks made by James Mattis, the US defence secretary, during a visit to Tokyo. He called Iran “the single biggest state sponsor of terrorism in the world” – a fact, he said, that could not be ignored or dismissed. In his briefing last week, Flynn explicitly focused on Iran’s support for Shia Muslim Houthi “terrorists” in Yemen, claiming Iran was behind recent attacks on Saudi and US warships. \nAll this fits with Trump’s top stated foreign policy priority: fighting terror. Iran’s steadfast support for Bashar al-Assad, Syria’s president, including the deployment of Iranian-led military units and fighters from its Hezbollah ally in Lebanon, has won it unprecedented leverage. Its advances have opened up the possibility of an arc of Iranian influence stretching from western Afghanistan to the eastern Mediterranean. \nThe US classifies Hezbollah as a terrorist organisation. US allies in the Gulf, notably Saudi Arabia, are nervous. Bahrain’s Sunni rulers, who preside over a majority Shia population, are especially jittery about alleged covert destabilisation. Trump spoke to King Salman, the Saudi monarch, last week. \nTrump is also due to meet Benjamin Netanyahu on 15 February. Israel’s hawkish prime minister has long warned of the existential threat posed by Iran. Israel has complained repeatedly about Iran’s backing for Hamas and other designated terrorist groups, and about its alleged weapons smuggling into Lebanon and Syria. Netanyahu can be expected to enthusiastically support a tougher Trump line. \nAlso onside is Theresa May, Britain’s prime minister. In a recent speech she referred to the “malign influence” exerted by Iran. Like Trump, May has offered unusually strong support for Israel. But not onside at this point are leading EU countries, who simply do not trust the US leader.\nWhat form will Trump’s anticipated anti-Iran drive take? It could involve more sweeping banking and financial sanctions, increased arms sales and overt military support for regional allies, a heightened US naval presence in the Gulf, or more special forces covert operations like that which went disastrously wrong in Yemen last week. Trump may also seek to make the Iran travel ban permanent. \nThe escalation in tensions comes at a sensitive time in Iran. Presidential elections are due this spring. American hostility could strengthen hardline conservative nationalists. Regional fears could thus become self-fulfilling.\nThere is one more Trump card to play. If he succeeds in his controversial aim of improving relations with Vladimir Putin, Trump could prevail on Russia to curtail its missile sales, nuclear assistance and diplomatic collaboration with Tehran. Given its bitter history of invasion by the great powers, Iran has good reason to fear encirclement. A putative US-Russia pact threatens exactly that.\n"

        "text": "\nIn Kermanshah, a Kurdish town in Iran’s north-west, the protests on Friday were a classic scene of revolt: young men in battered clothes shouting and hurling rocks at the police as a water cannon sprayed an ineffective mist over their heads. In footage on social media, the crowd never appeared to grow larger than a few hundred, but its defiance was palpable. What is vexing the people of Kermanshah? What is vexing the people of Iran, who have protested in 20 cities across the country for four successive days?\n\n\n\n\nRouhani acknowledges Iranian discontent as protests continue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepending on what media you follow, they want everything from lower prices and a better economy to the wholesale fall of the clerical government, and the world could be confronting anything from scattered discontent to a looming Tahrir Square. In the Islamic Republic of Iran, open displays of dissent are not as uncommon as is often portrayed: women engage in acts of civil disobedience over dress codes and access to public spaces, ordinary citizens protest against unpaid wages and lost deposits.\nBut street unrest in Iran is rare, and understanding it becomes a hall of mirrors: a nervous government blames outsiders, regional rivals spread rumours, and an array of sponsored or eternally hopeful opposition groups and activists project their ideologies and dreams on to what are, usually, serious demands for greater government accountability, fewer wealth disparities and less corruption.\nIn Kermanshah, people are fed up with inflation, unemployment and other parlous aspects of the Iranian economy, but they are also aggrieved at what they perceive as the state’s neglect of their region, which suffers those ills at higher rates than the national average. The state, for its part, is sharply aware of the people’s grievances and the perils of ignoring them. A report issued by a thinktank affiliated with the interior ministry, for instance, acknowledged that grievances were fuelling the appeal of Salafi jihadist groups in the north-west border region, and outlined ways to redress that.\nWhat flared in Kermanshah was about Kermanshah’s problems, but it spread from Mashhad in the north-east, where earlier in the week people demonstrated over the state of the economy, calling for “death to Rouhani”. Mashhad is the power base of two of the Iranian president Hassan Rouhani’s key opponents; one of whom, the local Friday prayer leader, openly sympathised with the protesters, as did, peculiarly, hardline media outlets. By Thursday there were signs that factions opposed to Rouhani were cultivating the interest, seeking to torpedo his economic plans and perhaps even make him politically unfit to seek the position of supreme leader, whenever the vacancy emerges.\nAs is eternally the case in a capricious Iran that seems quiescent until it suddenly isn’t, the unrest found a momentum of its own, resonating with working-class young people across the country who saw an outlet for their frustration with a hobbled political system that offers them no economic dignity, while allowing a moneyed class to succeed, travel, and thrive, increasingly in full public view. As the protests spread from province to province, others turned out in regions that, like Kermanshah, feel ignored by the central government. Rouhani was elected with a sweeping mandate in May, and the unrest is an unwelcome, early turning point in his second term. Though his platform promised economic recovery, Rouhani has found himself blocked at every turn. The sanctions relief promised by western states in exchange for the signing of the JCPOA nuclear agreement has not been forthcoming, and his plans to reform the banking system have met with opposition from entrenched clerical and security spheres that stand to lose. Rivals have arrested the brother of his vice-president, threatened his own brother with prosecution, and disrupted important oil and gas deals. The president has been forced to reach for smaller measures, such as raising exit taxes on foreign travel; raiding the middle class instead of pushing for structural changes.\n\n\n\n\n \n\nIranians have been conditioned for nearly 40 years to reflexively shout 'death to' something when they are enraged\n\n\nThe real challenges facing the country are not lost on Iranians. They wait, with varying degrees of patience, for the system to work out how it intends to govern and meet its economic promises, while locked in its current impasse: an executive branch whose powers are curtailed by clerical and military institutions with often rival political and financial agendas; a theocratic republic that has never squared how it can workably be that, while imposing unsustainable rules on a society that is desperate to integrate with the rest of the world.\nHow do we make sense of such an Iran, especially when it is wracked with protests, albeit small ones? Can anything nuanced be said with confidence? Only, perhaps, that while stark economic grievances fuel protest, a broad swath of Iranians are more nationalistic than ever, wary of the hostility that emanates from the Sunni Gulf states. They are divided over Iran’s activities in the region, and whether expenditure abroad is wasted money, but united in a rising anti-Arab xenophobia: for every shout heard this past week against Iran’s support for Hezbollah, there are whole neighbourhoods draped in camouflage tents to welcome back brigades that have been fighting in Syria.\n“Death to the dictator” has rung out across the cities of Iran, but Iranians have been conditioned for nearly 40 years to reflexively shout “death to” something when they are enraged. It can mean anything from “please overhaul this whole system” to “please get rid of this particular leader who embodies all my grief at my troubled life”. This is what happens when a people with a strong tradition of sophisticated engagement with politics face severe consequences for expressing dissent. “Death to” becomes a culture in and of itself when there is little space to articulate legitimate demands.\nRouhani acknowledged this on Sunday when he said “the people are completely free to make criticism and even protest,” though he warned against sowing chaos and disorder in the process. The president’s words are pithy, but opening up room for criticism will require him to bring shunned reformists back into the political sphere, and address the grievances of the young people who appear to feel they have no stake in the system. The intractability of doing all that has been the story of Iran all these years, and looks poised to remain so, regardless of the drama that periodically unfolds on the streets.\n• Azadeh Moaveni is a former Middle East correspondent for Time magazine\n"

        "text": "\nA Qatari plane sent to collect 26 kidnapped members of Doha’s ruling family has remained in Baghdad for a fourth day, as a regional deal that ties their release to the evacuation of four besieged Syrian towns resumed earlier this week.\nThe jet, which Iraqi officials suspect was carrying millions of dollars, arrived on Saturday ahead of the group’s expected release, which was later stalled by the bombing the same day of a convoy carrying residents of two Shia towns in northern Syria, Fua and Kefraya, whose fate had been central to the plan.\nThe suicide attack killed 126 people and wounded nearly 300 more in one of the most lethal strikes of the Syrian war, further complicating 16 months of negotiations that were underwritten by Iran and Qatar and involved four of the region’s most powerful militias.\n\n\n\n\nQatari royal family members used as leverage in Syrian population swap\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQatari officials arrived in the Iraqi capital on Saturday with large bags they refused to allow to be searched. Senior Iraqi officials said they believed the bags to be carrying millions of dollars in ransom money, to be paid to the Iraqi militia holding the royals, Keta’eb Hezbollah, and two Syrian groups who had agreed to secure the Shia leg of the swap, the al-Qaida inspired Hayat Tahrir al-Sham and the Islamist group Ahrar al-Sham.\nTwo Sunni towns near Damascus, Madaya and Zabadani , are also being evacuated to rebel-held areas in a choreographed swap that Syrian opposition leaders say has clear implications for the country’s demography. Dozens of residents were bused out of all four towns on Monday as the deal resumed.\nAs revealed by the Guardian on Saturday, the plan has immersed some of the Middle East’s most prominent players, exposing their support for powerful militias, and the influence that those same proxies wield over weak central governments in Baghdad, Damascus and Beirut. \nThe Syrian regime has played no role in the negotiations, and the Baghdad authorities have repeatedly said they did not known who was holding the Qataris. As their release has neared, it has shown no interest in confronting the hostage takers.\n\nSyrian evacuation deal\n\nIran had been the main driver of the earliest phase of a plan to evacuate up to 50,000 Shias from Fua and Kefraya, and its officials had negotiated directly with Ahrar al-Sham leaders. Iranian-backed militias have been central to the defence of the two Shia villages, which had been besieged by Islamist groups and jihadis for much of the past four years.\nThe talks had stalled, however, until the fate of the Qatari royals – many of them from the al-Thani tribe of which the emir’s family is part – were brought into negotiations in November. They were among a hunting party that was captured in southern Iraq by a convoy of up to 100 men in December 2015, and their whereabouts remained unknown until last November.\nSince then, the so-called four-towns deal has been given renewed impetus. Hezbollah from Lebanon, which is among the Syrian regime’s most powerful backers, and Ahrar al-Sham signed a memorandum earlier this month that was guaranteed by Qatar. At the same time, the Iraqi militia holding the royals moved their captives to Baghdad in preparation for one of the most sensitive – and politically loaded – hostage swaps in the region’s recent history.\nSources close to the negotiations say the suicide attack delayed the process, but did not derail it altogether. A senior Iraqi official familiar with discussions said the hostages were likely to be held until all those who want to leave Fua and Kefraya have been able to do so. Their release had previously been expected to be staggered as the plan progressed.\nAs many as 30 fighters from Ahrar al-Saham and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham were killed in Saturday’s suicide blast. Preliminary investigations suggest the car carrying the bomb had been driven from nearby opposition-held villages. One theory advanced in opposition circles is that the attack was carried out by a faction that had missed out on the promise of payment.\nA resident of Fua said his family members were likely to be taken to a suburb of Homs in the coming days, but that their ultimate destination was not yet clear. Some residents said they expected to end up closer to Madaya and Zabadani, or in the western suburbs of Damascus.\nAdditional reporting by Suzan Haidamous\n"

        "text": "\nThe Trump effect on international relations is likely to be studied for generations to come, but first we have to survive it. With the presidency sliding towards two major conflicts, that is no foregone conclusion. \nExperts on nuclear weapons and the institutionalised madness of mutually assured destruction, are increasingly making nervous jokes about living outside the blast radius in Washington DC and not bothering to buy wines that age well.\nSome of these dangers would be on the rise anyway. The standoff with North Korea was bequeathed by the previous administration. But Trump’s carnival-barker demagoguery has steepened the incline of the slippery slope to conflict in Asia and the Middle East while his blithe lack of concern about climate change is a serious hindrance to efforts to rescue the planet.\n\n\n\n\nTrump's bullying and bluster on Jerusalem is bad news for the UN | Patrick Wintour\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNorth Korea\nThe only time the two presidents met, Barack Obama warned Donald Trump about the threat posed by North Korea’s weapons programmes. Kim Jong-un was already well on the way to making an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) with a nuclear warhead. “It won’t happen!” Trump tweeted soon after. But it did, in spades. Pyongyang now has (most likely) a hydrogen bomb, and, quite possibly, a missile capable of reaching Washington.\n On to this conflagration-in-waiting, Trump has poured his own form of gasoline: epithets (“Little Rocket Man”, “short and fat”) combined with threats, to “totally destroy” North Korea with “fire and fury”. On two occasions when his secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, raised the prospects of dialogue, he has been humiliatingly rebuked by Trump or the White House, raising questions of how long Tillerson can stay on.\n The national security adviser, HR McMaster, has talked about a “preventive war” and a view has taken hold in the White House that a nuclear-armed North Korea would not be deterrable, and therefore will have to be confronted militarily, whatever the risks. \n Korea watchers have been weighing the chance of a conflict in the coming months, and at least one widely respected expert puts them at 50%. Those are not good odds for such a horrifying outcome.\nChina\nTrump wants to achieve two objectives in his relations with China that are fundamentally in conflict. He is seeking to make it the battleground for America First policies abroad, remaking a trade relationship in the US favour, while trying to enlist more help from Beijing in tightening the vice on North Korea.\nHow this conflict resolves itself and which goal gains primacy will shape much of the geopolitics of north-east Asia. The Chinese government’s decision to start building refugee camps suggests it is now planning for regime collapse in Pyongyang or war on the Korean peninsula.\nIran\nHostility to Iran is one of the few constants in Trump’s foreign policy. In part this seemed to be grounded in his desire to destroy Obama’s flagship foreign policy legacy, the 2015 deal in which Iran accepted curbs on its nuclear programme in return for sanctions relief.\n\n\n\n\nJared Kushner is wreaking havoc in the Middle East | Moustafa Bayoumi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Trump refused to certify this deal in October and threatens to torpedo it entirely in mid-January, when he could clear the way for sanctions by simply not signing a waiver.\nThat would put the Trump administration on a confrontation course with Iran, forsaking Washington’s traditional allies in Europe along the way, in favour of alignment with Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu, the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman and his Abu Dhabi counterpart, Mohammed bin Zayed, who are determined to push back Iranian influence in the Gulf.\nSyria\nThe Trump-Netanyahu-Salman axis has no real plan for containing Iran’s reach where it has extended most, in Syria. As Russia reduces its footprint there, Iran is expected to expand its own, rebuilding the Syrian army and bolstering it with proxy militias build on the template of Lebanon’s Hezbollah.\n The consolidation of Iranian military power from Herat in Afghanistan to southern Lebanon will remake the map of the Middle East, one of the most important long-term consequences of the US invasion of Iraq, followed by Obama and Trump’s decisions largely to stay out of the Syrian civil war. \n In 2018, the US will almost certainly become more aggressive in its attempts to contain Tehran’s reach. All of Trump’s national security team are hawkish on Iran. The question is whether they will opt for a slow-burn approach, bleeding Iranian forces through proxies, or choose all-out confrontation.\nRussia\nThere is far less unity in the Trump team over Russia. In fact, in his desire to grant concessions to improve the relationship with Vladimir Putin, the president is at odds with almost all his own most senior officials. The secretaries of defence and state, James Mattis and Rex Tillerson, have sought to box Trump in on the issue, digging in already entrenched positions, stipulating that there will be no sanctions relief and no diplomatic thaw until Russia pulls back in Ukraine.\n It is a fair prediction that in 2018 one of two things will happen. Either Trump overhauls his team, replacing Mattis and Tillerson with more pro-Moscow alternatives, or a newly re-elected Putin sours significantly on Trump. Either way, the drift of both countries from disarmament back to an arms race looks hard to stop. Even if the two leaders stay friendly they have each made nuclear arsenals totems of their authority.\nEurope\nThe UK government’s hopes of an extra-special relationship with Washington post-Brexit have foundered on the rocky shallows of Trump’s personality. The president’s Islamophobic forays into British politics has given Theresa May little choice but to rebuke him openly, drawing his ire in return.\nMeanwhile, deep differences over Iran, North Korea and climate change have forced Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel to plot a European course on global issues that is increasingly independent of the US. That divergence is likely to widen in 2018.\n"

        "text": "\nThe move of Saudi Arabia,the UAE and Bahrain against Qatar was swift. It was launched on the back of a fake news report placed by hackers on the website of Qatar’s official news agency. That allowed the three Gulf states to launch a media campaign led by Saudi- and UAE-controlled TV channels.\n\n\n\n\nSaudi Arabia stroked Trump's ego. Now he is doing their bidding with Qatar | Mohamad Bazzi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQatar was simultaneously accused of hosting Hamas; supporting the Muslim Brotherhood; backing Hezbollah; having close ties with Iran; sowing the seeds of sedition inside Saudi Arabia, and all the while maintaining intimate relations with Israel. If you can do all those things at the same time, you are indeed a magician.\nThe incoherence of these claims did not matter. The Saudis and Emiratis were addressing two audiences: the western one, which sees conflict in the Middle East through the exclusive prism of fighting terrorism; and the Gulf audience, which sees red when any of its leaders talk to Iran or Israel.\nOn Monday, a set of measures were announced that are unprecedented in peacetime: cutting diplomatic relations; closing all the borders, sea lanes and airspace; banning citizens of all participating states from travelling to Qatar, and banning all Qataris and residents of Qatar from travelling to those countries. These are measures not even used in a warzone. They violate all the norms of international aviation.\nThe pretext offered for all this was the desire to cut the funding of terrorist groups and radical Islamist ideology. And yet the most significant demand had nothing to do with this: it was to close down the al-Jazeera media network. This has been eagerly sought by many Arab states, first and foremost Saudi Arabia, ever since the original news channel launched in 1996.\nAl-Jazeera transformed the Arab media from a natural extension of the intelligence and security agencies to an independent sector whose values were transparency, accountability and democracy. This is exactly what so many Arab regimes fear.\nAl-Jazeera is very familiar with the charges Qatar now faces, because they were made against it: al-Jazeera was accused of aligning itself with Hezbollah, supporting Islamist groups and having intimate ties with Israel.\nThe most important event al-Jazeera covered was the Arab spring in 2011. This was a political earthquake, driven by the dreams and aspirations of a new generation, born under dictatorship but raised in the age of the internet. Young people sought to turn those dreams into reality, taking to the streets, using the power of networking and learning from the experiences of other youth groups from around the world. The dynamic was neither partisan, sectarian nor ideological.\nToppling regimes proved to be the easiest step. For these were ageing regimes whose structures had been infested with rampant corruption. Establishing consensus and rebuilding the state on democratic foundations was much harder. Young people alone were not up to the task. Counter-revolutionary forces, funded by the entire wealth of the Gulf, regained control.\n\n\n\n\n \n\nThe three countries that have imposed a siege on Qatar funded the 2013 military coup in Egypt\n\n\nThe dividing line was wealth. Revolutions erupted in the poorer nations such as Tunisia, Egypt, Libya and Yemen, while the rich countries stood behind the counter-revolution. The three countries that have imposed a siege on Qatar funded the 2013 military coup in Egypt and have propped up the regime of Abdel Fatah al-Sisi. They have also funded and armed General Khalifa Haftar in Libya and waged an open war on the forces of the Arab spring.\nQatar distanced itself from these policies. Qatar is not a democracy. Yet it was not hostile to the Arab spring.\nThis was the reason behind the first Gulf escalation against Qatar in 2014, when the same three countries withdrew their ambassadors from Doha and threatened to close their borders. They demanded Qatar support the Sisi regime, fight the Muslim Brotherhood and curb al-Jazeera’s independence.\nThe crisis did not escalate, as Barack Obama’s administration was not enthusiastic about such conflicts. By contrast, the current situation is being seized upon by Qatar’s foes. In his tweets, Donald Trump claimed ownership, saying the moves to isolate Qatar were the fruits of his address to more than 40 leaders of Muslim nations last month.\nThe current dispute has nothing to do with funding terrorism or radical ideology and even less to do with any official Qatari leaning toward Iran. This is a resumption of an old fight: drying all the fountains of independent conscience in preparation for a restoration of the old order in the Middle East. This time, however, the old order has tough new security powers, created by the war on terror and the support of a president who has jettisoned all the US’s values.\nBut are we going to fight terror with more persecution, or learn lessons from history? The fact is that dictatorial and corrupt regimes were the incubators of extremism in the region. Decades of suppressing liberties and violating human rights provided the oxygen for jihadi groups. While these regimes flouted the rule of law, they still enjoyed US support. As a result, the Middle East continues to be engulfed by conflicts and instability.\nWe should not rebuild the Middle East on the foundations that generated terrorism. We should align ourselves with a future of youthful dreams. These may often be utopian or unrealistic. But at least we would be walking forward, rather than stumbling backwards.\n"

        "text": "\nDonald Trump is expected to disavow the Iran nuclear deal in a speech denouncing the government in Tehran, but he will not call for the US to abandon the agreement, according to officials briefed on the president’s intentions.\nIn his speech on Friday, Trump will unveil what he will describe as a new, tougher strategy against Iran, and blame his predecessor, Barack Obama, for the rise of Iranian influence across the Middle East.\nHe will impose fresh sanctions on Iran’s Revolutionary Guard, propose measures to punish Tehran for its ballistic missile programme and call for Congress to pass legislation that will trigger automatic sanctions and potentially a US exit from the nuclear agreement in the event of future Iranian transgressions.\nEuropean officials expressed relief that the White House speech did not appear to represent an immediate US abrogation of the 2015 deal. \n\n\n Q&A Why is Trump hostile to Iran?  \n\n\n Show \n\n\n Hide  \n\nThe genesis of Trump’s particular antipathy to Iran is hard to pin down.  Before entering office he had been sceptical of Iran’s regional rival, Saudi Arabia. But during the 2016 election campaign all his closest foreign policy advisors, such as Michael Flynn, shared a worldview that portrays Iran as an uniquely malign actor in the Middle East and beyond. After the election, Israel, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates were successful in capturing the ear of Trump and his son-in-law and top adviser Jared Kushner.\n\n\n\n\nWas this helpful?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you for your feedback.\n\n\n\n\nSince Trump signalled in recent months that he did not want to constantly certify to Congress a deal that he detested, European diplomats have been lobbying intensively in Washington to stop the US walking out of the accord entirely. \n“Of all the places it could have been on the spectrum, this is very much at the better end,” one European official said. However, Trump’s tougher stance towards Iran is likely to cause friction. \nA White House statement said: “The United States’ new Iran strategy focuses on neutralizing the government of Iran’s destabilizing influence and constraining its aggression, particularly its support for terrorism and militants.\n“We will work to deny the Iranian regime – and especially the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) – funding for its malign activities, and oppose IRGC activities that extort the wealth of the Iranian people. We will counter threats to the United States and our allies from ballistic missiles and other asymmetric weapons.”\nTrump will say the steps Iran has taken as its part of the deal are not proportionate to the sanctions relief the country has been granted. \nHe will not ask Congress to reimpose sanctions, which probably would have caused the collapse of the 2015 agreement. Instead, he will recommend that Congress amends its own legislation so that Iranian infringements of the deal, and potentially other actions outside the scope of the agreement, would automatically trigger the reimposition of those sanctions.\nTrump’s speech will include a list of allegations of malign Iranian behaviour, focusing on its ballistic missile programme, its role in propping up the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad and its support for the Lebanese Shia militia, Hezbollah.\n\n\n\n\n'It's become a monster': is Iran's revolutionary guard a terror group?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump will impose sanctions on IRGC members, focused on its support of militant groups abroad, but will not go as far as listing the IRGC as a terrorist group.\nThe greatest European fear was that Trump would torpedo the nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), by reimposing sanctions or calling on Congress to do so. That does not appear be Trump’s plan, although officials cautioned he could change his mind at the last moment.\nInstead, the president will say his administration is willing to work with Congress and US allies to fix the “flaws” in the agreement, and vow to impose more vigorous verification of Iranian compliance.\n“In effect, he is saying if Iran goes one millilitre over the limits in the JCPOA, the US will leave. There will be no flexibility,” a senior official said.\nThe White House statement alleged that “in regard to JCPOA itself, the Iranian regime has displayed a disturbing pattern of behaviour, seeking to exploit loopholes and test the international community’s resolve”.\nThe statement noted that Iranian military leaders had vowed to prevent inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) of military sites, which it said violated Iran’s international commitments.\n“This behaviour cannot be tolerated; the deal must be strictly enforced, and the IAEA must fully utilise its inspection authorities,” the statement said.\nTrump will ask Congress to amend 2015 legislation known as the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act (INARA) to insert automatic triggers for the reimposition of sanctions and to change a clause that requires him to certify the agreement every 90 days, a source of political embarrassment as he has repeatedly denounced it as the “worst deal ever”.\nUnder a new version being negotiated with Congress, the president would have to endorse the deal less frequently but the US intelligence community would have to assess whether Iran is carrying out covert activity in facilities not visited by the IAEA.\nUnder the Obama administration, Iran’s stockpile of heavy water (which can be used in certain nuclear reactors) twice went above the agreed limits, although according to the latest report by the IAEA, it is now well below that benchmark. Trump will signal he will not be so accommodating.\nThe other signatories to the JCPOA – the UK, France, Germany, Russia, China and Iran, have said it is not realistic to try to renegotiate its terms. However, the European signatories have said they are ready to discuss how it can be bolstered by stiffer measures aimed at Iran’s missile programme, and what nuclear agreement might follow the JCPOA.\n"

He had done so twice already since coming to office. But this time, though nothing substantial has changed, he’s noisily refused. Does this matter? He cannot, alone, pull the US out of this deal but he has raised the spectre that this might happen “at any time”. He wants measures taken to counter Iran’s “destabilising actions”, and to “deny all paths to a nuclear weapon”, though without much clarity as to what this might entail. None of this contradicts the agreement formally, but it will all weaken it. Congress now has 60 days in which to decide whether to vote to reimpose sanctions whose lifting was a essential part of the quid pro quo contained in the agreement. Even if that happens, European allies who are party to the nuclear deal, along with Russia and China, have all clearly indicated they will act to preserve it.\nThe 2015 deal offered the best possible assurances that Iran’s nuclear military activities would be contained for roughly 10 years. It imposed strict international inspections, and provided strong incentives through sanctions relief. By defusing the nuclear crisis, it helped consolidate the more pragmatic or moderate factions within Iran’s power structures. It has deprived Israel’s leader of a pretext to threaten Iran with military strikes. It has helped to prevent the arms race in the Middle East from taking on entirely new proportions.\nNow, all these positive outcomes may start to unravel. Iran has promised a “crushing” response if its Revolutionary Guards are targeted by US sanctions – something Mr Trump has now called for. His provocation could lead to Iran pulling out of the nuclear accord – which may well be his tactical goal.\nThe emerging diplomatic picture is unprecedented: a US president finds himself at odds not only with his own close advisers, but with all the key international players involved in a major crisis over international security – including close European allies. All still support the nuclear deal with Iran. “America First” has become “America alone” at the moment when it is clear that America, alone, has far less power than it still supposes.\nMr Trump’s decision is the culmination of years of rhetoric lambasting the Iran deal as “the worst ever”. He has been encouraged by Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister. No one else believes that Iran has violated the terms of the deal. Even Mr Trump now claims only that Iran has violated the “spirit” of the accord. The regular assessments provided by the International Atomic Energy Agency, the UN-related body missioned with monitoring Iran’s activities, have found no violations. Iran’s behaviour in the region may well be criticised, but the 2015 accord had nothing to do with the actions of Iranian-controlled armed groups in Syria, Iraq or Yemen, nor with its support to Hamas and Hezbollah. The agreement was solely focused on curtailing the regime’s uranium enrichment programme and removing its ability to build a nuclear weapon within a relatively short period if it took the decision to do so.\nThere is no need to panic. Just as the agreement has its limits, so does Mr Trump’s angry rhetoric demonstrate his. Whether or not he has recognised reality himself, or been led carefully round it by his handlers, he has not quite taken any action which Iran would find completely unacceptable. He threatens and blusters, but the agreement will stand unless Congress decides to break it. This is where all the pettiness of his character works for the good. Because he is interested only in victory, he may fail entirely to notice that he has backed down from some of his own rhetoric. But Congress must now refuse to impose sanctions that would definitively break the deal.\n"

        "text": "\nElections come with their own rituals. The big night demands Dimblevision and swingometers and some low-budget jape that presumably sounded good in production meetings. But one thing 8 June won’t be is normal. There is no point in journalists reporting this as a horse race, when all the polls predict a bloodbath. It is futile for specialists to pick apart policy promises made in spring 2017 when the next few years’ haggling over Brexit will upend everything from the safeguards on the food we eat to our relations with other countries.\nMost important, it is delusional to treat this as just another vote, when Theresa May and her outriders are intent on turning it into a culture war. June is shaping up to become a hinge point in British politics: the moment a venom was injected into public discourse.\n\n\n\n\nTrump’s new culture war has left liberals reeling. They thought they’d won that battle | Rich Lowry\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo see how culture wars wreck a society, look at Donald Trump’s America. The huckster seized the White House by pitting middle America against the coastal elites, whites against migrants, the Christian right against Muslims and women who want the right to choose. He didn’t need serious policies while he was working through the deck of identity cards. He didn’t bother with a vision because he was too busy orchestrating hate. The pundits who judged him by conventional political yardsticks missed the point. Trump wasn’t playing politics: he was prosecuting a culture war – and a culture war is anti-politics.\nThis is not how the British do things. On this small island, politics is supposedly about millions of people with opposed interests arguing out their differences before arriving at a resolution. That’s the ideal and, honestly, you don’t need to tell me that the reality often falls short because I’ve moaned enough about it in the Guardian. But what Theresa May offered last week was not even pretending to be politics; she was instead cranking up a culture war.\nFirst came her speech about how “the country is coming together”, even while her political opponents were not. Her cheerleaders were in the press the next day, baying for “Blue murder” and for her to “Crush the saboteurs”. I watched all this from the US; and in the land where Democrats are now routinely labelled “treasonous” it all sounded eerily familiar: us v them; the people v Westminster; leavers v remainers.\nNever mind that May is one of those elite professional politicians she is now decrying. Forget that she’d been a remainer. The whole point of culture wars is that the generals look nothing like the people they wish to recruit as foot soldiers: take the people’s billionaire, Donald Trump.\nTo see where May is leading Britain, I picked up one of the great contemporary histories of America. In Nixonland, Rick Perlstein charts how his country turned to all-out culture war. Perlstein dates the process back to Richard Nixon, who in the late 60s successfully “forged a public language that promised mastery of the strange new angers, anxieties, and resentments wracking the nation”. By 1972 he had won a landslide victory.\nI defy any Briton to read Perlstein’s description of this “brilliant and tormented man”, completely devoid of the glad-handing or baby-kissing skills of the natural politician, and not think about a leader closer to home. In 1972 Nixon’s attack dogs destroyed his Democratic opponent, George McGovern, by defining him as the candidate of “amnesty, abortion, and acid”. You can already see how Jeremy Corbyn will be tagged as the friend of Hamas, Hezbollah and tax hikes.\n\n\n\n\n \n\nYou can already see how Jeremy Corbyn will be tagged as the friend of Hamas, Hezbollah and tax hikes\n\n\nNixon appealed to the “silent majority”. In Britain it was the hard-right Nigel Farage who greeted the Brexit vote as “a victory for real people”. May picked that up and turned it into “the ordinary people” rebelling against the elite. And it was her aide, Nick Timothy, who reportedly came up with the line about how “if you believe you are a citizen of the world, you are a citizen of nowhere”. Just as Nixon did, and within a similarly short period of time, the May camp has taken a language previously found only on the fringes of the right, and made it mainstream.\nPrevious generations of Tories have flirted with identity politics. Margaret Thatcher attacked the miners as “the enemy within”. When pushing through their historic spending cuts, David Cameron and George Osborne claimed they were punishing the “skivers”, not the “strivers” – even though they were taking cash off the working poor and people with disabilities.\nBut three things are different this time. First, as home secretary May spent six years trialling this form of culture politics – and if she retains any squeamishness, it doesn’t show. Never forget that she deployed into areas of high immigration vans reading “Go Home”. Second, social media has exacerbated the politics of identity. All those Twibbons and shared petitions. All that Facebooking about how I am a Bernie Bro and you are a Deplorable, while she is part of the Pantsuit Nation. This kind of self-identification must be part of the business model for Facebook and Twitter: all the better to direct-market you with.\nFinally, the Brexit vote did reveal deep cultural differences between leavers and remainers. A study published last year by the NatCen social research institute found the EU referendum’s 48:52 split was “less about a traditional left-right battle and more about identity and values”. Confronted by a statement such as “young people today don’t have enough respect for traditional British values”, leave voters would be far more likely to nod, leading the report’s author to conclude that this was “a strong sign that the … culture wars of the US have arrived in Great Britain in earnest”.\nSuch differences in attitudes are hardly new, but the current crop at Westminster no longer know how to deal with them politically. Not after 30 years in which eager young Oxford PPE-ists have seen politics as being all about capturing Mondeo man and not scaring the City.\nMay’s solution is to turn Britain into a one-party state. After June she will probably have a once-in-a-generation majority, and the mandate to define Brexit any way she wants. A Conservative using the language of the hard right will have won the battle to define the very identity of Britain. That is what makes 8 June unlike any other election I can remember.\n"

        "text": "\nTop story: President ‘has not earned honour’ of Westminster speech \nHello, it’s Warren Murray picking the eyes out of it for you today.\nJohn Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, has stood by his opposition to Donald Trump giving an address in parliament. “An address to both houses of parliament is not an automatic right; it is an earned honour,” Bercow said at an event last night. “My view is that he has not earned that honour.”\nSpeaking of Westminster, Theresa May is facing calls from business in the UK and Europe to urgently strike a Brexit transition agreement with the EU. Leaders of the CBI and continental bodies will meet the PM at Downing Street on Monday to warn that if she waits much longer companies will have to plan for the worst-case scenario. May is facing calls from some leading Conservatives for a bold reshuffle of her cabinet after the resignations of Priti Patel and Michael Fallon. Our politics desk has calculated that Patel’s abortive trip to Nairobi at the climax of the Israel affair wasted about £8,000 of taxpayers’ money.\n\nTrump’s pilgrimage – Donald Trump never ends a day without a serving of controversy and it was no different in South Korea, where at a state banquet the president was fed shrimp from waters off an island claimed by Japan. The inclusion of a wartime sex slave as a dinner guest also rankled with Tokyo. It was smooth sailing in China, though, where President Xi Jinping was naturally pleased – after all “the leader of the world’s number one power has just made a pilgrimage to him”, said Chen Daoyin, a Shanghai-based political scientist. Trump has now arrived in Vietnam for the regional Apec summit. All eyes will be on any interaction with President Vladimir Putin of Russia.\n\nRadioactive leak – A nuclear accident somewhere in Russia or neighbouring Kazakhstan has sent a cloud of radiation over Europe, according to monitoring bodies. The level of ruthenium 106 pollution is not considered a risk to human health or the environment, says France’s IRSN. But the accident itself would have been bad enough for people around the site to be evacuated. The most plausible source lies between the Ural mountains and the Volga river. Ruthenium 106 can only be produced in nuclear reactors. The leak is thought to have come from a nuclear fuel treatment site or centre for radioactive medicine.\n\nLebanon standoff – Saudi Arabia has ordered its citizens to leave Lebanon as pressure mounts in the region over Hezbollah’s influence on the country’s affairs. Donald Trump and Israel have supported fiery rhetoric from the Saudis accusing Iran, which backs Hezbollah, of forging strongholds across the region. Lebanon’s prime minister, Saad Hariri, resigned last week at the Saudis’ behest, accusing Hezbollah of dominating life in Lebanon and subverting its politics.\n\nOuting touts – The Competition and Markets Authority has raided the ticket resellers StubHub and Viagogo as part of an investigation of industrial-scale touting. The CMA is understood to have issued an “information notice” to four ticket resale companies, also including GetMeIn and Seatwave, demanding details of any relationships with major touts and turnover from ticket sales. Our continuing Paradise Papers investigation has revealed the Canadian tout Julien Lavallee, one of the world’s biggest operators, used the Isle of Man to avoid paying UK taxes on hundreds of tickets for gigs including Adele, Ed Sheeran and Metallica.\n\n‘Not answering questions’ – The comedian Louis CK has refused to comment after being accused of sexual misconduct by five women. HBO has dropped the comedian’s shows from its on-demand service, while the premiere of his new movie was scrapped and he cancelled an appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. The Israeli intelligence firm Black Cube has apologised for working with Harvey Weinstein to gather information on the women accusing him of sexual harassment and rape. “It’s a shame we took the job,” Asher Tishler, a member of Black Cube’s advisory board, told Israeli TV.\nLunchtime read: Taylor Swift’s talent for personal drama\nAlexis Petridis awards Taylor Swift four out of five stars for her new album, Reputation. Our reviewer deals first with the sleeve notes where Swift mocks the inevitable speculation concerning who she’s singing about this time – “gossip blogs will scour the lyrics for the men they can attribute to each song”, she writes. Petridis says: “She has a very good point about the wearying way work by female singer-songwriters is invariably interpreted as autobiographical. However, it is hard to think of another pop star who’s proved so brilliant at manipulating the media through their music.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Cover art from Taylor Swift’s new album, Reputation\n\n\nThen there’s the music – Swift “cutting her last ties with her Nashville roots in favour of the blare and honk of EDM-influenced pop. At their best, these songs have a fizzing, pugilistic energy,” Petridis writes. “At their least appealing, they’re still decent pop songs, but they feel generic.”\nSport\nGareth Southgate’s bold determination to promote youth will mean Tammy Abraham, Jordan Pickford and Ruben Loftus-Cheek making their senior debuts against Germany, and three under-21 forwards are likely to be drafted into the set-up for next week’s friendly with Brazil. “Dare to Dream” is the slogan of Northern Ireland’s World Cup campaign but the manner of their 1-0 defeat to Switzerland in the play-off first leg will give their manager, Michael O’Neill, nightmares.\nMo Farah is set to continue as a lottery-funded athlete when UK Athletics announces the names on its World Class Performance Programme this morning, dramatically increasing the chances he will run again in a British vest at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. And Eddie Jones has revealed that Owen Farrell and Maro Itoje were furious to learn they would sit out England’s autumn international against Argentina on Saturday.\nBusiness\nMarkets in Asia were lower this morning as there was continued uncertainty over the possibility of tax reforms in the US. Japan’s Nikkei was down 1.1% albeit from a 21-year high. That followed losses on Wall Street. The pound was buying US$1.31 and €1.13 overnight.\nThe papers\nBrexit dominates the papers today. In the Independent’s digital edition the British legal expert who wrote article 50 tells Theresa May she is misleading the public by saying the EU exit cannot be stopped.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Guardian front page, Friday 10 November 2017\n\n\nThe Express says EU membership is costing the UK £980m a week and “that’s why we must get out fast”. The Guardian splashes on British and European business leaders demanding a breakthrough from May on a Brexit transition deal. The Telegraph has May daring rebels to defy her on Brexit and vowing to set a date for the country’s exit from the EU.\nThe Mirror says what much of the country must be thinking with its headline on Boris Johnson: “Now sack him.” The Mail has a story about Cressida Dick saying young offenders should be locked up sooner and face harsher sentences to “break the cycle of crime”. The Times has an intriguing tale about David Cameron lobbying Beijing on behalf of a friend and former donor over a planned £500m investment fund with which he might take a job. The Sun is reaching slightly with the headline “Readies salted, Gary?” about Gary Lineker avoiding tax by selling a home in Barbados through an offshore firm.

        "text": "\nDonald Trump’s rally in Novi, Michigan, on Friday had a guest that caught many observers by surprise. Hovering behind Trump’s head in the fourth row, was a man in a white turban and the traditional dress of a Shia Muslim cleric.\nThe man was later identified as Lebanese sheikh Mohamed El-Hajj Hassan, who has since received a barrage of criticism for attending the rally given Trump’s inflammatory language toward Muslims, including his call for all Muslims to be banned from entering the country.\nBefore the rally in Novi, Trump met with Hassan and members of the American MidEast Coalition for Trump – a group working to build support for Trump in Middle Eastern communities – at an event organized by his foreign policy adviser and Fox News pundit Walid Phares.\nHassan was previously a part of Hezbollah, the Shia militant and political group that has been listed as a foreign terrorist organization by the US state department since 1997. He broke off from the group shortly after the 2005 assassination of former prime minister Rafik Hariri, and formed the Free Shia Movement, a splinter group that has gained little to no traction in Lebanon since.\nHassan has since maintained his position as a vocal opponent of Hezbollah; even appearing on a TV show last year referring to the group as hooligans.\nHis attendance at the Trump rally last week drew the ire of a range of onlookers online. \n“Every commentator (who isn’t a member of a political party) that I’ve seen comment on this was just confused,” said Joey Ayoub, Lebanese blogger at Hummus For Thought and MENA editor at Global Voices Online. Ayoub added that Hassan’s anti-Hezbollah stance does not gel with Trump’s tacit support for Vladimir Putin, as the Russian president supports Hezbollah in Syria. \nHowever, Hassan said Trump told him he likes Muslims and he has no problem with them, according to the Detroit Free Press. The Trump campaign did not respond to The Guardian’s multiple requests for comment.\nMichigan is home to the largest Arab American population in the country. Trump probably hoped that Hassan and the dozen other religious leaders he met with at the American Mideast Coalition for Trump event, would help mend his image among Arab Americans.\n“Trump obviously benefits from the optics of having a visibly Muslim Arab at his rally,” said Dr HA Hellyer, senior non-resident Fellow at the Atlantic Council. But he added, “it will mean harsh questions for Hassan from the larger Arab and Muslim communities in the United States, and probably in Lebanon too.”\nThe meeting with Trump was orchestrated by Phares, a controversial figure in Trump’s campaign. The news of his appointment as foreign policy adviser to Trump in March 2015 was met with a wave of backlash. \nPhares is reported to have been a member of the Phalangist militia, a Christian Maronite force, during Lebanon’s sectarian civil war that spanned 1975-1990. According to a 2011 Mother Jones investigation, Phares was in charge of the ideological training of militia troops and even advocated for the creation of a Christian enclave within Lebanon, a hardline position in the multi-confessional state. There is no indication that Phares personally carried out any acts of violence or war crimes. \nThe 15-year-long Lebanese conflict was brutal, with atrocities committed on all sides. The Phalangist militia itself, which was allied with the occupying Israeli army, was responsible for one of the war’s lowest points: the 1982 massacre of hundreds of civilians at the Sabra and Shatila Palestinian refugee camp in Beirut. \nPhares ultimately fled Lebanon during the civil war and relocated to the US where he then became an academic. Over the next two decades, Phares published several books and espoused a hardline approach to Islam and the Middle East.\n“He began to endear himself to neocons after 9/11, with his books and studies about radical Islam,” said Mohamad Bazzi, a New York University professor in journalism. \nAccording to Bazzi, he lumped all Islamist movements together – non-violent and violent – and heightened fears and suspicions around Islam. Phares became a regular “expert” guest on NBC and later Fox News, even though several terrorism experts, such as Andrew Exum, have discredited his work.\nIn 2011, the former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney appointed him to his campaign as a foreign policy adviser, the same role he now fulfills for Trump.\nThe appointment was met by a backlash from the Council of American-Islamic Relations and a variety of Islamic scholars who said that Phares had no credibility.\n“It would be akin to turning to [former KKK member] David Duke to get advice on race relations,” Omid Safi, currently director of Duke University’s Islamic Studies Center, told the Daily Beast at the time.\n• This article was amended on 21 October 2016 to remove a reference to Martha Crenshaw discrediting Phares’ work.\n"

        "text": "\nEuropean foreign ministers have strongly rejected calls by Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, for them to follow Donald Trump’s example and recognise Jerusalem as Israel’s capital.\nOpposition from across the European spectrum came as Netanyahu made the first official trip to the EU by a sitting Israeli premier in 22 years.\nEven the Czech Republic, one of Israel’s closest allies, said the US president’s decision was bad for peace efforts. France said Jerusalem’s status could be agreed only in a final deal between Israelis and Palestinians.\n\n\n Q&A What will US recognition of Jerusalem mean for the peace process?  \n\n\n Show \n\n\n Hide  \n\nThe peace process has been at death’s door since the former secretary of state John Kerry’s peace mission ended in failure in 2014. But the international community – apart from the US – is united in saying recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel is disastrous for any hopes of reviving meaningful talks. The status of Jerusalem is one of the pivotal issues that diplomats and peacemakers have said must be agreed between the two parties in negotiations.\nPalestinians will see Trump’s announcement as the end of their hopes and demands for East Jerusalem as a capital of a future independent state. While few want a return to violence, many will feel diplomatic efforts have got them no closer to a state of their own. \nThe Israeli government will be thrilled. Ever since it captured (and later annexed) East Jerusalem in the 1967 six-day war, Israel has claimed the city as its “eternal and undivided” capital, and has longed for international recognition. Some 200,000 Israelis living in illegal settlements will also celebrate.\n\n\n\n\nWas this helpful?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you for your feedback.\n\n\n\n\nNetanyahu called on European governments to back a much-mooted US peace initiative despite the fact that Trump has yet to reveal any details about it.\nFrance’s foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, made clear that the EU would not write a blank cheque for an unseen Trump peace plan and urged Washington to disclose what was being drawn up by Jason Greenblatt, Trump’s Middle East envoy, and Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser.\n“We’ve been waiting already for several months for the American initiative, and if one is not forthcoming then the European Union will have to take the initiative,” Le Drian said.\nThe latest diplomatic moves came as Hezbollah’s general secretary, Hassan Nasrallah, said the group would renew its focus on the Palestinian cause after what he called “victories” elsewhere in the region – not least in Syria, where Hezbollah has been supporting the Assad regime.\nNasrallah also called on Hezbollah’s allies to put in place a united strategy “in the field” to confront Israel, as tens of thousands of people turned out for a rally in Beirut called by Nasrallah. \nNetanyahu, arriving for a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels, said Trump’s move made peace in the Middle East possible “because recognising reality is the substance of peace, the foundation of peace”. \nHe said all or most European countries would move their embassies to Jerusalem and recognise it as Israel’s capital, though there is no evidence that any European country is preparing to do so.\n\n\n\n\nUS seeks to quell global outrage over Jerusalem: 'The sky hasn't fallen'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSweden’s top diplomat, Margot Wallstrom, said after the meeting: “I have a hard time seeing that any other country would do that and I don’t think any other EU country will do it.” \nThe EU foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, reiterated the bloc’s commitment to a two-state solution, telling Netanyahu it would continue to recognise the international consensus on Jerusalem. The EU would increase its peace efforts and hold talks with the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, next month, she said.\nPalestinian officials have called on Europe to take a greater role in the moribund peace process after Trump’s move, which sparked protests across the Middle East and accusations that the US had abdicated its role as an honest mediator.\nAbbas travelled to Istanbul and Cairo to meet Egypt’s president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, and his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, to rally support ahead of an emergency summit of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation in Turkey this week.\nPalestinians are calling on the 57-member OIC, which will convene on Wednesday, to make its own recognition of Jerusalem as the Palestinian capital.\n Following his own meeting with Sisi on Monday, Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, said any steps that pre-empted a possible agreement between Israel and the Palestinians were counter-productive and destabilising. \nArab states condemned Trump’s Jerusalem decision last week and vowed to press international bodies to take action against it, though without announcing any concrete measures. \nThere has been widespread condemnation in Germany of anti-Israel protests over the weekend that included chants of “Death to Israel” and incidents in which protesters set light to Israeli flags and ignited yellow Stars of David. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  People protest against Trump’s decision at the Brandenberg Gate in Berlin.

He stressed, however, that the developments of the past week did not prejudge the issue of final borders.\n“The president’s decision stands,” Satterfield said. “It is, as I said, what the president believes was the right step, at the right moment. The president also said that these measures in no way prejudice the outcome of final status negotiation between Israel and the Palestinians.”\nAdditional reporting by Kate Connolly in Berlin\n"

        "text": "\nDonald Trump’s visit to Saudi Arabia was a huge success. The Saudis wisely pandered to the new president’s foibles, rolling out the red carpet for a lavish celebration. Even Trump’s speech on Islam, a potential minefield, was generally well-received by his hosts.\nYet while Trump’s speech – and his strong criticism of Iran – may have been pleasing to his Gulf States’ hosts, it should worry Americans. Pushing back on Tehran allows Trump to symbolically break with Barack Obama’s policies and is popular among congressional Republicans, but it is also dangerous, with the potential to undermine the nuclear deal, slow the fight against Isis, and embroil the United States more deeply in parochial regional struggles.\n\n\n\n\nDonald Trump focuses fire on Iran's support for 'terrorists and militias'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndeed, though Congress and the White House are at odds on issues from healthcare to Russia, they generally share a determination to ratchet up pressure on Iran, whether via sanctions, regional military support or arms sales. This pushback is often attributed to Iran’s ballistic missile testing: though the nuclear deal does not in fact obligate Iran to stop testing, policymakers have pushed for a US response, arguing that the tests violate the spirit of the agreement. \nMore broadly, congressional Republicans and the White House have consistently portrayed the Obama administration as “soft” on Iran, arguing that the nuclear deal has allowed Iran to destabilize the region. During the Republican primaries, most candidates called for the nuclear deal itself to be overturned. \nThankfully, Trump’s cabinet appointees – and the president himself – have since shied away from unilaterally ending the nuclear deal. Yet most express support for a more assertive policy towards Iran, including the secretary of defense, James Mattis, who has described Iran as “the biggest destabilizing force in the Middle East”.\nAnd while Trump’s first national security adviser, Mike Flynn, may have departed the administration, the Riyadh speech appears to echo many of the ideas expressed in Flynn’s book, in particular conflating Iran with Isis and al-Qaida.\nUnfortunately, the new administration’s approach to Iran is fundamentally flawed. \nTake Congress’ perennial favorite policy – sanctions – as an example. In response to the missile tests, the Trump administration has already added to existing sanctions lists. But a bill working its way through the Senate would be much more impactful, giving the president broad authority to sanction those who deal with Iran’s missile program, and potentially applying broad terrorism sanctions to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). \nYet most of the proposed sanctions would probably be more symbolic than practical. And while applying sanctions to the IRGC could impose economic costs on the Iranian economy, it carries substantial risks. Adding new sanctions, even if they do not technically violate the terms of the Iran deal, could strain the deal, driving a wedge between the United States and our European allies, who are broadly satisfied with Iran’s Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action compliance. \nThe results of the Iranian election on Friday confirm that the Iranian people continue to support the deal and seek increased engagement with the outside world. The nuclear deal itself is hardly perfect, but it prevents Iran from developing a nuclear weapon; failure of the deal would be a step backwards. Worse, if new sanctions cause the deal to fail, it is the United States that will appear culpable to the international community. \nThe Trump administration also appears to be seeking a regional pushback against Iran. On a recent trip to Riyadh, the defense secretary, James Mattis, discussed Yemen, telling the press: “We’ll have to overcome Iran’s efforts to destabilize yet another country.” Though he went on to reference a United Nations process, off the record, defense officials say the administration is seriously considering providing additional military support and weaponry to the campaign in Yemen. \nThe administration has signaled its support for Saudi Arabia’s assertive anti-Iranian foreign policy in other ways too: Trump’s visit to Saudi Arabia included the announcement of a multibillion dollar arms sale, including a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) battery like the one recently deployed to South Korea.\n\n\n\n\nWhy Donald Trump's 'Arab Nato' would be a terrible mistake | Rashid Khalidi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, however, these steps are primarily symbolic and carry risks. Though Iran has sent some weapons to Yemen’s Houthis, the group is not truly an Iranian proxy like Hezbollah. Getting the US military more deeply involved in Yemen’s civil war – helping the Saudis with their assault on Hodeidah port, for example – would only bog down American forces, worsen Yemen’s dire humanitarian situation, and cost Iran little.\nRaising tensions with Iran in Yemen and elsewhere also risks slowing the anti-Isis campaign in Syria, one of the few places we share a common goal with Iran. It could even place US troops in Iraq and other war zones in danger of retaliation from Iranian-linked Shia militia groups in that conflict. \nUltimately, despite the president’s remarks in Riyadh, neither he nor congressional Republicans appear to have a coherent strategy towards Iran. The desire to appear tougher than Obama on Iran is understandable, but the administration’s approach risks collapsing the Iran deal and undermining American interests elsewhere in the region. Hardly a winning strategy. \n"

        "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/09/jared-kushner-wreaking-havoc-middle-east",
        "text": "\nThe entire Middle East, from Palestine to Yemen, appears set to burst into flames after this week. The region was already teetering on the edge, but recent events have only made things worse. And while the mayhem should be apparent to any casual observer, what’s less obvious is Jared Kushner’s role in the chaos.\nKushner is, of course, the US president’s senior advisor and son-in-law. The 36-year-old is a Harvard graduate who seems to have a hard time filling in forms correctly.\nHe repeatedly failed to mention his meetings with foreign officials on his security clearance and neglected to report to US government officials that he was co-director of a foundation that raised money for Israeli settlements, considered illegal under international law. (He is also said to have told Michael Flynn last December to call UN security council members to get a resolution condemning Israeli settlements quashed. Flynn called Russia.)\nIn his role as the president’s special advisor, Kushner seems to have decided he can remake the entire Middle East, and he is wreaking his havoc with his new best friend, Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, the 32-year-old who burst on to the international scene by jailing many members of his country’s ruling elite, including from his own family, on corruption charges.\nDays before bin Salman’s unprecedented move, Kushner was with the crown prince in Riyadh on an unannounced trip. The men are reported to have stayed up late, planning strategy while swapping stories. We don’t know what exactly the two were plotting, but Donald Trump later tweeted his “great confidence” in bin Salman. \nBut the Kushner-bin Salman alliance moves far beyond Riyadh. The Saudis and Americans are now privately pushing a new “peace” deal to various Palestinian and Arab leaders that is more lop-sided toward Israel than ever before.\nAhmad Tibi, a Palestinian parliamentarian in the Israeli Knesset, explained the basic contours of the deal to the New York Times: no full statehood for Palestinians, only “moral sovereignty.” Control over disconnected segments of the occupied territories only. No capital in East Jerusalem. No right of return for Palestinian refugees.\n\n\n\n\nTrump’s error on Jerusalem is a disaster for the Arab world … and the US too | Rashid Khalidi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is, of course, not a deal at all. It’s an insult to the Palestinian people. Another Arab official cited in the Times story explained that the proposal came from someone lacking experience but attempting to flatter the family of the American president. In other words, it’s as if Mohammed bin Salman is trying to gift Palestine to Jared Kushner, Palestinians be damned.\nNext came Donald Trump throwing both caution and international law to the wind by recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.\nBut it’s not just Israel, either. Yemen is on the brink of a major humanitarian disaster largely because the country is being blockaded by Saudi Arabia. Trump finally spoke out against the Saudi measure this week, but both the state department and the Pentagon are said to have been privately urging Saudi Arabia and the UAE to ease their campaign against Yemen (and Lebanon and Qatar) for some time and to little impact. Why? Because Saudi and Emirati officials believe they “have tacit approval from the White House for their hardline actions, in particular from Donald Trump and his son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner,” journalist Laura Rozen reported.\nThe Kushner-bin Salman alliance has particularly irked secretary of state Rex Tillerson. Kushner reportedly leaves the state department completely out of his Middle Eastern plans. Of special concern to Tillerson, according to Bloomberg News, is Kushner’s talks with bin Salman regarding military action by Saudi Arabia against Qatar. The state department is worried of all the unforeseen consequences such a radical course of action would bring, including heightened conflict with Turkey and Russia and perhaps even a military response from Iran or an attack on Israel by Hezbollah.\nHere’s where state department diplomacy should kick in. The US ambassador to Qatar could relay messages between the feuding parties to find a solution to the stand-off. So what does the ambassador to Qatar have to say about the Kushner-Salman alliance? Nothing, since there still is no confirmed ambassador to Qatar. \nWhat about the US ambassador to Saudi Arabia? That seat’s also vacant. And the US ambassador to Jordan, Morocco, Egypt? Vacant, vacant, and vacant. What about assistant secretary for Near Eastern affairs, a chief strategic post to establish US policy in the region? No one’s been nominated. Deputy assistant secretary for press and public diplomacy? Vacant.\nIt’s partly this vacuum of leadership by Tillerson that has enabled Kushner to forge his powerful alliance with bin Salman, much to the detriment of the region. And in their zeal to isolate Iran, Kushner and bin Salman are leaving a wake of destruction around them.\nThe war in Yemen is only intensifying. Qatar is closer to Iran than ever. A final status deal between Israel and the Palestinians seems all but impossible now. The Lebanese prime minister went back on his resignation. And the Saudi state must be paying the Ritz-Carlton a small fortune to jail key members of the ruling family over allegations of corruption.\nThere’s a long history of American politicians deciding they know what’s best for the Middle East while buttressing their autocratic allies and at the expense of the region’s ordinary people. (The New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman has traditionally provided the rationale for America and its allies in the region, and his recent sycophantic portrayal of bin Salman certainly didn’t disappoint!)\nBut the Kushner-bin Salman alliance also represents something else. Both the US and Saudi Arabia are concentrating power into fewer and fewer hands. And with fewer people in the room, who will be around to tell these men that their ideas are so damaging? Who will dare explain to them how they already have failed?\n\nMoustafa Bayoumi is the author of the award-winning books How Does It Feel To Be a Problem?: Being Young and Arab in America\n\n"

        "text": "\nThe Trump administration’s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital has drawn widespread condemnation across the Arab world, with political leaders, commentators and locals labelling the move as provocative and a threat to global security.\nThe decision has been cast as the final nail in the coffin of a two-state solution to the Israel/Palestine conflict – an approach broadly recognised by Arab states – and the end of meaningful US diplomacy between both sides after almost 70 years.\nIt has also allowed competing factions across the Middle East to refocus on a common cause that had drifted from the spotlight over the past five years, eclipsed by regional power plays, war and insurrection.\n\n\n\n\nCan the Middle East peace process survive Trump's Jerusalem decision?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeaders in Turkey and Lebanon warned of dangerous instability in the wake of the announcement, which overtly sides Washington with Israel at a time when the US had been attempting to table a new peace initiative between Jerusalem and Ramallah.\nThe future of Jerusalem had been central to all previous peace pushes and commentators and residents were united in their belief that negotiations could not begin if the Palestinians’ claim to the holy city was no longer on the table.\nJordan’s King Abdullah said: “There is no alternative to a two-state solution, and Jerusalem is key to any peace agreement. It is imperative to work fast to reach a final status solution and a peace agreement. Ignoring Palestinian Muslim and Christian rights in the holy city could fuel terrorism.”\nIn Beirut, Hassan Nasrallah, the Hezbollah leader, called for demonstrations on Monday to protest against the decision. “Trump had support from the Arabs or else he wouldn’t have been able to do this,” said Nasrallah. “The Arab government will scream for a few days then go on with the occupation. America has shown that it doesn’t take into account the opinion of its allies.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Lebanese and Palestinian students chant slogans and hold Palestinian flags as they take part in a protest in the southern port city of Sidon. Photograph: Mohammed Zaatari/AP\n\n\nBut US ally Saudi Arabia was also quick to denounce the move. Riyadh had sponsored a regional peace initiative that promised full Arab League recognition of Israel in return for a retreat to borders that were in place before the 1967 war.\nThat plan had been the centrepiece of dormant peace efforts. However, it had barely been raised in recent years as energies had been diverted to other regional crises, and support in Riyadh and the Gulf states for the Palestinian leadership had ebbed.\nAli Nassereddine, a chef from the Shia suburb of Dahiyeh in south Beirut, claimed Trump’s announcement had likely been coordinated with the Saudis and other allies, including the UAE. Echoing sentiments also widely expressed in Syria and Turkey, he said: “The decision was not only based on Israelis and Americans, the Arabs had a hand in it. The question should be directed to the Palestinians and [Palestinian leader] Mahmoud Abbas and all the resistance: do you now realise that negotiations will not get you anywhere?”\n\n\n\n\nTrump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital sparks West Bank clashes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Iraq, powerful militia and political leaders vehemently condemned the move. Muqtadr al-Sadr, a Shia leader and chief protagonist in the country’s civil war, said: “I am ready to be the first soldier, not even leader, if all factions involved decided to confront Israel. No peace with the evil, arrogant and colonial governments. I ask of the Palestinians not to accept this decision in any way, and to revitalise the revolution.”\nOther militia groups in Iraq also issued an effective call to arms, as did al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula. There was no immediate response from other regional terror groups, such as Islamic State.\nKhalid al-Zubidi, a commentator for the Jordanian newspaper Ad Dustour, said: “Despite the turmoil the Arab world has faced the last years with governments turning on each other or on themselves, there are still some situations that we cannot negotiate. Jerusalem is one of them for Arabs.”\nWriting in the Saudi-aligned Asharq al-Awsat, Samir Atallah said: “Previous American presidents never touched on the subject of Jerusalem because they knew it goes beyond the Israeli Palestinian conflict. It involves Muslims worldwide. Unfortunately Trump doesn’t have a historical or political background. If his intention is to solve the Palestinian conflict he chose the wrong door. Jerusalem is not a political symbol but will forever be a religious one.”\nKhalid Zuberi, a banker in Cairo, said: “This shows [Trump] has bad faith towards us. He is a fool and he did this to be provocative. We all know he wants to please those who elected him, like the US Christian Zionists. But he must understand from his friends in the region that this will cause chaos. It will be difficult to be an American businessman or tourist here now. More than that though, the region is condemned to decades of chaos because of this.”\nAdditional reporting by Nadia al-Faour\n"

Islamic Jihad, a precursor of Hezbollah, later claimed responsibility for the murder. “If anything, we could be breeding anger and terror. So I’m completely against what’s happening.”\nStephen Curry, the two-times Most Valuable Player and face of the team, made his feelings clear when asked to respond to comments from the chief executive of Under Armour, his primary sponsor, that Trump is “a real asset” to the country.\n“I agree with that description, if you remove the ‘et’,” Curry said wryly.\nReserve guard Shaun Livingston was even more to the point in a February radio interview. “I really feel that my views would keep me from going and visiting,” he said. “Just with everything that’s going on right now, I just don’t agree with a lot of stuff that’s happening.\n“I definitely wouldn’t go.”\nJohn F Kennedy was the first president to host the NBA champions when the Boston Celtics visited in January 1963, but it became an annual occurrence under Reagan’s administration, including Golden State’s visit with Barack Obama after winning the 2015 title.\n"

Dillon declined to say who owned or operated the drone, but other officials said it was likely Iranian or Hezbollah.\n“It was something that showed a hostile intent, a hostile action and posed a threat to our forces because this drone still had munitions that were still on it,” Dillon said.\nAt-Tanaf, on the key highway connecting Damascus with Baghdad, has been menaced by a surge of Iran-backed troops loyal to Syrian president Bashar al-Assad.\nThe area, also just north-east of the Jordanian border, is used by coalition forces as a training and staging area for attacks against Isis. \nThe coalition has established a “de-confliction” zone, extending 34 miles from the garrison, in which pro-regime and Russian forces are not supposed to operate.\nDillon said the drone had fired on coalition forces patrolling outside the zone.\nIt was the third such strike in as many weeks, and the second this week, by the Pentagon, which has sought to stay out of Syria’s civil war to focus firepower instead on Isis in Syria and Iraq.\nDillon said the United States had earlier in the day carried out a strike against two pro-Syrian government pickup trucks with weapons that had moved against US-backed fighters near At-Tanaf.\nThe concern is that such strikes could take away attention from the fight against Isis militants.\n\n\n\n\nUS-backed forces fighting Islamic State enter Syria stronghold of Raqqa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Unfortunately, there have been [these] incidents that have taken our focus away from fighting Isis,” Dillon said, using an acronym for Islamic State.\n On Wednesday Kurdish and Arab forces backed by the United States entered Islamic State’s de facto capital of Raqqa, setting the stage for what could be a months-long campaign to reclaim the militants’ largest stronghold in Syria.\n For months, air strikes and special forces from the US-led coalition have helped them encircle Raqqa, which Islamic State seized in 2014 and has used as a base to plan attacks abroad.\n"

        "text": "\nWhen Channel Nine’s 60 Minutes crew were detained in Beirut for their part in a botched child kidnap attempt, many of the finest members of the Australian press pack were dispatched to cover the story. As if having four reporters and assorted participants in jail wasn’t enough, things got a little interesting for at least one member of the following party. Charles Miranda, the Europe correspondent for News Corp Australia, filing for the Herald Sun and the Daily Telegraph, was detained by Hezbollah.\n\n\n\n\nAustralian mother and TV crew released in Lebanon kidnap case\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMiranda, based in London, had flown into Beirut and reported on the 60 Minutes drama for most of last week. “It’s an absolute circus,” Miranda told ABC Radio from outside a Beirut court. But then Miranda suddenly disappeared from the story and another journalist, David Murray, was flown in from Brisbane to fill the gap. Why would he leave in the middle of the biggest story on his beat? Well a piece expressing dismay that the abduction attempt was carried out in such a dangerous spot may well have had something to do with it. “Lebanese security forces have expressed dismay someone would attempt a kidnap mission not just at peak hour on one of the busiest streets in Beirut but in the district of Dahieh — the infamous stronghold of the Shiite Islamist Hezbollah,” he wrote. “Security on this bustling central shopping strip is significant with CCTV, military checkpoints, heavily-armed patrols and roaming Hezbollah agents distinguishable in their tanned jackets conducting random checks on locals.” \nAccording to sources in Beirut, Miranda had illegally photographed the impounded boat, then blundered into Hezbollah territory where he and his photographer were detained for 90 minutes. After the harrowing experience Miranda headed for the airport and left. This note was pinned to the end of his story after the incident: “*News Corp Australia was questioned for an hour and a half by uniformed Hezbollah agents on motor scooters shortly after driving into the district. Mugshots were taken and passports examined with details of five years worth of travel having to be explained. The crew was then escorted through the area for a defined set time limit.” \nA spokesman for News Corp Australia told Guardian Australia that Miranda had left the country for personal reasons.\nFriendly fire\nHours after Tara Brown and her colleagues were released by the Beirut court, along with the Australian woman at the heart of the fiasco, Sally Faulkner, Nine announced an inevitable internal inquiry. Former 60 Minutes executive producer Gerald Stone will lead the review, also including Nine executive (and former boss of A Current Affair) David Hurley and Rachel Launder, in-house counsel. “At no stage did anyone from Nine or 60 Minutes intend to act in any way that made them susceptible to charges that they breached the law or to become part of the story that is Sally’s story,” Hugh Marks, Nine’s CEO, said in an email obtained by Australian Associated Press. “But we did become part of the story and we shouldn’t have.”\nAs they welcome Brown back, Nine executives face a barrage of unanswered questions. Marks insisted that the story “not only is in the public interest but also one the public is interested in”. Contrary to a suggestion by ABC’s Media Watch last week, Beast understands that Nine news director Darren Wick, sent to coordinate the legal effort in Beirut, did not know about the story before the arrests and will not lose his job. Marks made a point of singling out Wick in his note for staff. “We should all drop in to Wickie’s office when he is back and say thanks.” \n\n\n\n\nHow did it come to this? Inside the doomed bid to snatch Sally Faulkner's children\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the 60 Minutes crew – reporter Brown, producer Stephen Rice, cameraman Ben Williamson and sound recordist David Bailment – were locked up in Lebanon, friends worked hard to portray them as nice people and ordinary mums and dads. \nBut pleas from Nine stars Tracy Grimshaw and Karl Stefanovic and network veteran Ray Martin attracted mixed sympathy even at home. Joining these supporters was Martin’s writer/producer daughter Jenna Martin who wrote a piece chiding the critics for news.com.au. “I am very sympathetic to the plight of the crew involved, and of their families, and I’m offended by the lack of support they have received from members of their own profession — people who frankly should know better,” Jenna Martin said. “In my lifetime, dad covered warzones, coups, and natural disasters among countless, dangerous others.\n“I wonder if the same accusations would have been hurled at Four Corners if it was them, not 60, who found themselves banged up abroad. I don’t remember any cries of cowboy journalism when the Four Corners crew were themselves arrested in Malaysia last month, despite the fact that local laws were breached in that case too.”\nWell, not exactly. The Four Corners crew was detained in Malaysia after attempting to question PM Najib Razak about serious corruption charges and was released without charge.\nCombing the evidence\nIn what is almost certainly the biggest Australian media story of the year, every detail is being mulled over – even the state of Brown’s hair. Both the Australian and the Daily Telegraph reported that Brown had denied having a blow wave before her court appearance in Beirut on Thursday. “I don’t even have my hairbrush in here,” she said. “Did they seriously think we have some sort of beauty salon here?” Brown said. There was a great deal of interest in Brown’s blonde bob after it was seen being ruffled up by Lebanese police while they pushed her into a car. The caption on a publicity shot of Brown in the Tele read: “Usual look ... 60 Minutes journalist, Tara Brown, denied she had a blowwave to look more glamerous [sic]“.\nBolt’s exciting time\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Andrew Bolt, Sky News’s 7pm presenter. Photograph: Robert Edwards/Sky News\n\n\nAndrew Bolt’s new show on Sky News will debut at 7pm on Anzac Day. Bolt whose columns are published in the Herald Sun, the Daily Telegraph, the Courier Mail and the Advertiser, will present his political talk show live from a Melbourne studio every weeknight. “This is the most exciting time to be on Sky News talking about politics,” Bolt said. “But there are many other things to talk about that other shows don’t dare discuss frankly. My aim for the show: to be the place where arguments aren’t shut down but tested. I am into challenging opinions, not confirming them.”\nThe Age of man\nThe Sydney Morning Herald and the Age have appointed a raft of people to senior positions after a restructure and – apart from Judith Whelan becoming editor of the SMH under editor-in-chief Darren Goodsir – the line-up is pretty blokey. On the SMH three out of four editing roles were filled by men and on the Age only two of the ten editing roles were filled by women. Behind the scenes the SMH is still dropping long-term contributors. After letting columnists Wendy Harmer and John Birmingham go, the SMH has also dropped its daily television writer Ben Pobjie. The Sun-Herald has also parted ways with veteran television writer David Dale, a former editor of the Bulletin whose Tribal Mind column was published every Sunday in the Sun-Herald and The Sunday Age. \nMeanwhile as we predicted last month tabloid queen and Daily Telegraph staffer Gemma Jones has been appointed national chief of staff at the Australian. Jones is taking the role from Petra Rees who has been promoted to deputy editor. Jones is a former chief of staff for the Tele under Paul Whittaker, now editor of the Oz.\nIn praise of Col Pot\n\n\n\n\nNews Corp editor Col Allan to retire after four decades at helm of Murdoch papers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s been fun reading all the eulogies for retiring New York Post editor Col Allan (aka “Col Pot”) in News Corp’s Australian papers. Former News CEO John Hartigan, who worked with Allan when he edited the Daily Telegraph,described him as “a genius in prosecuting the craft of journalism,” in the Australian. In the same edition of the paper, media editor Darren Davidson speculated that Fairfax missed a big talent when they failed to hire Allan 40 years ago when he turned up for a cadetship interview. “It’s a decision that Fairfax would come to rue for decades.” \nIn his column Mark Day wasn’t short of hyperbole stating that Allan was “the standout editor of his generation”. Maybe he was inside Holt Street where his reputation as a hard-drinking, bad-tempered editor was made. But in the Big Apple where the New York Post haemorrhaged money for 15 years under Allan it’s a different story. The Post is a loss-making newspaper said to cost Rupert Murdoch as much as $80m a year. As for Allan himself, he said little, and we mean very little. He gave one quote to the Australian: “The real point is young Australians should fly the coop. America. Europe. ­Talent works everywhere.”\n"

        "text": "\nAfter losing their stranglehold on Deir ez-Zor and being pushed further from their stronghold of Raqqa, Islamic State fighters have retreated towards the Euphrates river to prepare for what some senior leaders are now billing as a last stand in eastern Syria.\n\n\n\n\nLast Isis stronghold in Syria could fall by October, says UN envoy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDozens of Isis members have fled to towns and villages along the Euphrates valley after abandoning Deir ez-Zor, where their forces had besieged a Syrian military base and up to 100,000 local people for the past three years.\nThe city was retaken earlier in the week by forces fighting on behalf of the Assad regime, including Iraqi militia units, Hezbollah from Lebanon, and the Syrian military itself. \nThe rapid entry into the desert city marked another defining moment in the multi-pronged war against the terror organisation which has seen it lose vast tracts of territory over the past year and face the prospect of comprehensive defeat in both Syria and Iraq.\nIn Raqqa to the north, where US-backed Kurdish forces have taken the Old City, Isis resistance to a relentless sweep south from north-eastern Syria has continued to evaporate. At least 60% of the city – 14 out of 23 neighbourhoods – is now under the control of advancing forces who expect the rest of Raqqa to be taken within the next two months.\nThe speed of the assault in both cities continues to highlight the sharp decline in Isis’s fortunes, laying bare its increasing inability to fight as a large cohesive unit, and forcing it back to its roots as a guerrilla organisation. “They are very good at underground war,” said Hisham al-Hashimi, an Iraqi-based scholar on the terror group. “Let’s not forget the damage they caused for many years before they took Mosul.”\n\nSyria map\n\nIsis leaders have taken refuge in the Syrian town of Mayedin, and retain a presence in the nearby town of Sukhna, as well as Bukamal on the Iraqi side of the Syrian border. Isis leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was reportedly sighted in Bukamal on the first day of Eid al-Adha, a witness has claimed. The witness has previously reported sightings of the fugitive leader which have later been confirmed.\nThe US government said last week that it did not know the whereabouts of Baghdadi but claimed there were “intelligence indicators” that suggested he was still alive. Both Iran and Russia had previously claimed he had been killed in an airstrike near Deir ez-Zor. Reports of the self-styled caliph’s demise have been frequently made over the past three years. The Guardian has previously confirmed that he was injured by an airstrike near Shawqat in Iraq in early 2015. However, little has emerged about his whereabouts, or health, since.\nThe Euphrates valley has long been seen as the site of an inevitable showdown between Isis and its hunters, which include the militaries of Iran, the US, Iraq, Russia and Syria, and powerful Shia-dominated proxy forces directed by Iran.\n“It is very fertile and prized ground,” said a regional official. “The people there are traditionally conservative and many are allied to the Isis cause. They will be hard to oust.”\nRegional estimates suggest that as many as 5,000 Isis members, most of them fired by ideological conviction, have moved into the area, from Deir ez-Zor and Raqqa, and also western Iraq, where an extensive push has ousted the group from all but small pockets of the country.\nThe battle for the northern Iraqi town of Tal Afar was won by Iraqi forces earlier this month after a much shorter than expected battle to retake it. The town of Hawija, further south, remains in Isis hands, but hundreds of Isis members from the town are believed to have surrendered to Kurdish forces in late August, meaning those who remain will struggle to hold the town.\nAdditional reporting by Nadia al-Faour\n"

        "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/07/saudi-arabia-accuses-iran-of-supplying-missile-to-houthi-rebels-in-yemen",
        "text": "\nSaudi Arabia’s crown prince has accused Iran of “direct military aggression” by supplying missiles to Houthi rebels in Yemen, raising the stakes in an already tense standoff between the two regional rivals.\nMohammed bin Salman linked Tehran to the launch of a ballistic missile fired from Yemen towards the international airport in the Saudi capital of Riyadh on Saturday. The missile was intercepted and destroyed.\n“The involvement of the Iranian regime in supplying its Houthi militias with missiles is considered a direct military aggression by the Iranian regime,” the prince said on Tuesday during a phone conversation with the UK foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, according to the state-run Saudi Press Agency. He added that the move “may be considered an act of war against the kingdom”.\nIran has called Riyadh’s accusations as baseless and provocative.\nSaudis and their Sunni Arab allies view Yemen’s Houthi rebels – who belong to the Zaydi sect of Shia Islam – as Iranian proxies and have accused Tehran of giving them military backing. \nEurope’s top diplomat Federica Mogherini warned on Tuesday that the mounting tension between Saudi Arabia, Iran and their respective allies and proxies is “extremely dangerous”.\nSaudi Arabia has led a military intervention in support of Yemen’s internationally recognised government since 2015, during which more than 10,000 people have been killed and three million displaced.\nThe kingdom has tightened its blockade on Yemen following the missile launch, ordering the closure of all ports and grounding all humanitarian flights – a move that threatens to exacerbate an already devastating humanitarian crisis in the country.\nHuman Rights Watch described the indiscriminate targeting of a predominantly civilian airport in Saudi Arabia as an “apparent war crime.”\n“But this unlawful attack is no justification for Saudi Arabia to exacerbate Yemen’s humanitarian catastrophe by further restricting aid and access to the country,” said Sarah Leah Whitson, Mideast director for the New York-based watchdog.\nThe Saudi-led coalition fighting the advances of Houthis in Yemen, claimed that an examination of the debris which landed inside the King Khalid International Airport “has confirmed the role of Iran’s regime in manufacturing these missiles and smuggling them to the Houthi militias in Yemen”.\nIt said the missile’s firing was “a blatant act of military aggression by the Iranian regime” and that the kingdom reserves the “right to respond”.\nPrince Mohammed, who is also defence minister, is seen as a key proponent of the intervention in Yemen. While his country is also in the midst of domestic political upheaval, he has been emboldened by the unwavering support of US president Donald Trump, who this week said he had “great confidence” in the Saudi prince.\nSpeaking in Washington, Mogherini stopped short of criticizing Trump’s warm support for the crown prince’s aggressive anti-Iranian stance.\nBut she made it clear that in Europe, in any case, officials would like to see both sides calm their rhetoric and seek a “minimum of common ground” on which to build peace.\nThe Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, tweeted on Monday that the Saudi kingdom was engaged in “wars of aggression, regional bullying, destabilising behaviour” and “risky provocations” and yet “blames Iran for the consequences”. \n“#KSA [Kingdom of Saudi Arabia] bombs #Yemen to smithereens, killing 1000’s of innocents including babies, spreads cholera and famine, but of course blames Iran,” Zarif said in a series of tweets. \nAmid the rising tensions over Yemen, Saad Hariri resigned as Lebanon’s prime minister on Saturday, throwing the country into fresh political turmoil. Speaking from Riyadh, Hariri cited Iranian influence across the region for his surprise move, and said he feared that he could be assassinated like his father was in 2005.\nIran denounced Hariri’s resignation as part of a joint Saudi-US plot to destabilise the region. Hassan Nasrallah, the chief of Lebanon’s powerful Shia militant group and political movement Hezbollah, said the move was “imposed” on Hariri by Saudi Arabia. Saudi officials have denied the claims.\n“Less than a year after Saad Hariri re-entered office, his departure raises fears that Lebanon is being dragged anew into the dangerous crosswinds of the Saudi-Iranian rivalry,” wrote Julien Barnes-Dacey, a senior Middle East policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, on Tuesday. \n\n\n Profile Who is Prince Mohammed bin Salman?  \n\n\n Show \n\n\n Hide  \n\n\n\n\nBackground\n\nPrince Mohammed, 32, is the Saudi crown prince and defence minister. He was named as heir to the throne in a June reshuffle by his father, King Salman, that sidelined his older cousin, Prince Mohammed bin Nayef.\n\n\n\nAscent\n\nPrince Mohammed’s profile and powers have soared in recent years under the tutelage of his father, who has given him an almost free hand across most aspects of society. He has consolidated more influence than anyone else in the kingdom, spearheading plans for the privatisation of the state oil company, Aramco, taking charge of the war in Yemen, and leading the way in the move to blockade and isolate Qatar. \n\n\n\nReforms and purge\n\nSince his appointment as crown prince, Prince Mohammed has launched a dizzying series of reforms dubbed Vision 2030, designed to transform the kingdom’s moribund economy and put the relationship between the state and its citizens on a new footing, underpinned by a pledge to “return Saudi Arabia to moderate Islam\".  On 4 November he led an astonishing corruption purge in which 11 senior princes, one of the country’s richest men and scores of former ministers were arrested. Critics say the purge and his headlong rush to revolutionise is driven by a push for unprecedented power.\n\n\n\n\n\nWas this helpful?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you for your feedback.\n\n\n\n\nIran and Saudi Arabia are at odds over a number of regional conflicts. Saudi Arabia and its Sunni Arab allies also complain about Iran’s increasing influence in Iraq and Syria, though the exact extent of Iranian support for rebel forces in Yemen is unclear.\nIn Tehran, the tensions were reflected in cartoons and newspaper headlines. “Are we hearing the drums of war?” asked the Iranian daily Jame’e-Farda.\nRiyadh was angered when Trump’s predecessor, Barack Obama, reached a landmark nuclear agreement with Tehran in 2015, fearing that the US was tilting the regional power balance towards Tehran. But Trump’s election has reversed that, bringing Washington closer to the Saudis.\nTrump is currently trying to convince the Saudis to list its massive state-run oil company, Aramco, which is the biggest energy company in the world, on the New York exchange.\nReacting to the missile launch, Trump said “a shot was just taken by Iran, in my opinion, at Saudi Arabia ... and our system knocked the missile out of the air”. \nMohammad Ali Jafari, head of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, said: “Mr Trump has said many baseless things and told many lies and frequently falsely accused Iran and this one of those slanders.” He insisted that Iran does “not have even the possibility to transfer missiles to Yemen”.\n\n"

He said: “I am not happy with the shoot-to-kill policy in general. I think that is quite dangerous and I think it can often be counterproductive. I think you have to have security which prevents people firing off weapons where you can and there are various degrees of doing things, as we know, but the idea you end up with a war on the streets is not a good thing.

I have also invited friends from Hamas to come and speak as well. Unfortunately, the Israelis would not allow them to travel here, so it is going to be only friends from Hezbollah. So far as I am concerned, that is absolutely the right function of using parliamentary facilities, to invite people from other parts of the world so that we can promote that peace, that understanding and that dialogue. And the idea that an organisation that is dedicated towards the good of the Palestinian people and bringing about long-term peace and social justice and political justice in the whole region should be labelled as a terrorist organisation by the British government is really a big, big historical mistake.”\n\n\n \n\n\nPlay Video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1:10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  7.

The context explained more about why he considered it right to engage with such people.\n8. Comments on IRA bombing \nAsked last month by Sophy Ridge on Sky News if he could “unequivocally condemn the IRA”, Corbyn said: “Look, bombing is wrong, all bombing is wrong. Of course I condemn it.” Ridge responded: “But you’re condemning all bombing, can you condemn the IRA without equating it to …” Corbyn said: “No.”\n\n\n \n\n\nPlay Video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n0:21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  'Can you condemn unequivocally the IRA?'\n\n\nContext: While this clip appears to show Corbyn refusing to condemn the IRA, he goes on to say: “No, I think what you have to say is all bombing has to be condemned and you have to bring about a peace process. Listen, in the 1980s, Britain was looking for a military solution in Ireland – it clearly was never going to work.

Corbyn in context\n\n\nAnalysis: As edited for the Tory attack ad, this clip seems misleading.\n9. Failure to answer a question about the IRA\nOver dramatic music, the attack ad ends with a BBC Ulster presenter Stephen Nolan asking Corbyn by phone: “Are you refusing to condemn what the IRA did?” and Corbyn saying he can’t hear before suggesting they do the interview later. The line then appears to go dead. The implication is clear that Corbyn won’t answer the difficult question.\n\n\n \n\n\nPlay Video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n0:30\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  'Are you refusing to condemn what the IRA did?'\n\n\nContext: In fact he had tackled the question earlier in the interview, which went as follows:\nJC: Look, I condemn what was done by the British army as well as by other sides as well. What happened in Derry in 1972 was pretty devastating as well.\nSN: Do you distinguish between state forces, what the British army did, and the IRA?\nJC: Well, in a sense the treatment of IRA prisoners which made them into virtual political prisoners suggested that the British government and the state saw some kind of almost equivalency. My point is that the whole violence issue was terrible, was appalling, and came out of a process that had been allowed to fester in Northern Ireland for a very long time and surely we can move on a bit and look towards the achievements of the peace process in moving things forward.\nSN: But if you are a potential candidate for prime minister of the UK, Jeremy, it is fair for me to push you one more time. Are you prepared to condemn what the IRA did?\nJC: No, what it is fair to push me on is how we take the peace process forward.\nSN: Are you prepared to condemn what the IRA did?\nJC: Can I answer the question in this way? We gained ceasefires – they were important and a huge step forward. Those ceasefires brought about the peace process, brought about a reconciliation process, which we should all be pleased about. Can we take the thing forward rather than backward?\n\n\n \n\n\nPlay Video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n2:16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  9.

The agency said it had released the treasure trove “in the interest of transparency and to enhance public understanding of al-Qaida and [bin Laden].”\n\n\nCIA \n(@CIA)\nToday we released nearly 470,000 files recovered in 2011 raid on Usama Bin Ladin’s compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan.https://t.co/QZcoAu3uEw pic.twitter.com/Dn8awV9ndn\n\nNovember 1, 2017\n\n\nThough there have been previous reports that Bin Laden travelled to the west, this is the first confirmation.\nAn entry in the nondescript school notebook describes how Bin Laden first travelled to “the west” for an unspecified “treatment” when he was in “sixth grade” and 13 years old.\n\n\n\n\nIsis captures territory around former Bin Laden stronghold in Afghanistan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following year the teenager, the wealthy son of a billionaire Saudi construction tycoon, spent 10 weeks in Britain “studying”. Bin Laden gives no further details, but he has previously been reported to have taken an English language course at Oxford.\nIn the journal, Bin Laden briefly describes visiting the home of William Shakespeare in Stratford-upon-Avon but says he was “not impressed” by British society and culture during his time in the UK.\n“I got the impression that they were a loose people, and my age didn’t allow me to form a complete picture of life there,” he wrote. “We went every Sunday to visit Shakespeare’s house. I was not impressed and I saw that they were a society different from ours and that they were a morally loose society.”\nThe journal was bought in a well-known bookshop in Pakistan a few hours drive from the garrison town of Abbottabad, where Bin Laden spent five years with his family before his death.\nThe journal appears to be partially written by Bin Laden’s son, Khalid, who was also killed in the Navy Seal raid, and sometimes takes the form of a question and answer session between father and son.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  The house in which Shakespeare was born in Stratford-upon-Avon. Photograph: VisitBritain\n\n\nThe journal entries are at times apocalyptic, describing the two men’s dreams and visions, including a scenario in which Muslim countries unite after the revolutions and peace is established with the west – a prelude to the end times in some branches of Islamic theology. \nAt other times, Bin Laden appears more practical, discussing recommendations for al-Qaida’s messaging in the aftermath of the revolutions to better capitalize on rising Islamist sentiments and to take advantage of the wave of popular unrest.\nBin Laden’s mention of his feelings towards the west after his time in Britain will interest experts. Most accounts of his life say he was radicalised as a student and later when he became engaged as a volunteer organiser for Arab foreign fighters taking part in the war against the Soviets in Afghanistan from around 1981.\nThe US government has released hundreds of documents over recent years, though this is the largest such release.\nThe US-based website, The Long War Journal, received some material in advance and reported that the documents give new details of al-Qaida’s relationship with Iran.\nOne 19-page document contains a senior militant’s assessment of the group’s relationship with Iran, which describes an offer by Iran to provide some unidentified “Saudi brothers” with “money, arms” and “training in Hezbollah camps in Lebanon, in exchange for striking American interests in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf”.\nIt is not known if the offer was accepted – if it was made at all – and the inclusion of the document will raise suspicion that one motive for the release of the new hoard was to place material that casts Iran in a bad light in the public domain.\nMike Pompeo, the Trump-appointed director of the CIA, has a reputation for an aggressively hawkish stance on Iran.\nIt has been known for some time that scores of senior al-Qaida officials and their families were held in Iran after fleeing there in the aftermath of 2011. However, the relationship between the detained militants and their captors was tense, and no solid evidence of active cooperation on terrorist operations has yet emerged.\nAmong the material released by the CIA was some which suggested Bin Laden’s time in the UK may have had a deeper influence than he may have admitted.\n\n\n \n\n\nPlay Video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1:34\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Never-before-seen footage of Osama bin Laden's son released by CIA – video\n\n\nLoaded on one computer was video of the Rowan Atkinson comedy Mr Bean dubbed in Pashtu, the local language in western Pakistan and eastern Afghanistan, episodes of the animated programme Wallace and Gromit, and the viral video “Charlie bit my finger”. \nThere were also more than 30 videos on crocheting.\n"

        "text": "\nIraqi forces have advanced to the base of the toppled minaret of Mosul’s Great Mosque of al-Nuri, hours after it was destroyed by Islamic State militants, as the bitter eight-month battle to recapture the city reached a tipping point.\n\n\n\n\nDestroying Great Mosque of al-Nuri 'is Isis declaring defeat'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe destruction of the mosque marked a pivotal moment in the war against Isis, which declared its now withered caliphate from there three years ago. The terror group’s wanton act of sabotage was widely seen as a harbinger of its imminent defeat.\nAcross northern Iraq, only a portion of Mosul’s old city and a small adjoining neighbourhood remain under Isis control. The nearby towns of Tal Afar and Hweija, both of which are surrounded, make up the remainder of the group’s territory, a mere sliver of the lands over which it had lorded at the height of its power in mid-2014.\nAs its fortunes have turned, the group’s remaining members have fled Iraq for the deserts of Syria. So rapid has been their capitulation that plans are now being drafted for a decisive battle later this year, somewhere between the Syrian and Jordanian borders, areas far from those that Isis had coveted.\nLined up in pursuit are a range of players who had have staked claims throughout the fight with Isis, as well as parallel regional conflicts, and have waited for the time to consolidate. As the organisation crumbles, all sides have now started competing for an edge, who gets to define what emerges from the collapse of Isis is a prize bigger than winning the war itself. \nRussia, Iran and the US are scrambling for supremacy, eschewing the brinkmanship that has peppered the war for direct clashes unprecedented in the region over recent decades.\n\nMosul mosque map\n\nAs Mosul and Isis’s Syrian epicentre, Raqqa, have started to teeter, Iranian proxies and the US have squared off at least three times on the Syrian side of border. Last week, the risk of further escalation increased when a US jet downed a Syrian plane over the north of the country, drawing a warning from Russia that coalition planes should stay out of its radar range. \nWashington said its fighter jet acted to defend its proxies who were moving through Isis-held areas around Raqqa. Raised over the past year to the chagrin of Syria, the anti-Assad opposition, Turkey and increasingly Russia – the mainly Kurdish force has been set the task of retaking Raqqa and nearby towns. As it has edged ahead, Russian and Syrian forces have taken more aggressive postures. \n“They are running interference there,” said a senior western official. “They do not want anyone but the Syrian army, which is nearly all Iranian-backed Shia militias, taking that city. As the campaign has changed from talk to reality, they have started to act against it.”\nIran too has taken an unusually direct stance in the multilayered conflict, firing ballistic missiles from its territory, across Iraq, to the Syrian town of Mayadin, where scattered Isis leaders have regrouped. \nThe attacks marked the first time Tehran had launched ballistic missiles in combat since the end of the Iran-Iraq war nearly three decades ago.\nThe missiles were ostensibly revenge for attacks claimed by Isis earlier this month in the Iranian parliament and near the tomb of Ayatollah Khomenei, founder of the Islamic republic.\nThe missiles also served another purpose, regional officials believed. Iran was setting aside its preferred use of proxies for a direct stake in the conflict, just as the US had done several weeks earlier by attacking Hezbollah members who had advanced towards their own proxies close to the border area of Tanf.\nSince then, US forces protecting the Syrian opposition groups it has raised in the east of the country have twice shot down approaching drones. That has not stopped Iranian backed forces, mainly comprised of Lebanese Hezbollah, from moving east toward the Iraqi border to the north of Tanf, stopping the US and its allies from advancing north toward Raqqa and preventing the Kurds from moving too far south.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Displaced Iraqi residents cross a military pontoon bridge in western Mosul. Photograph: Erik de Castro/Reuters\n\n\nThe bewildering movements of five state militaries – Syria, Iraq, Iran, Russia and the US – as well as their various proxies seems likely to increase the number of collisions. \nEach side faces a series of calculations that have little to do with how to defeat what remains of Isis, or to deal with the hundreds of thousands of refugees who are fleeing the latest fighting - the death throes of Mosul and Raqqa – and the looming campaign in Deir ez-Zor and Mayedin, where Isis looks set to make its last stand.\nThe human toll of the war for Mosul continued to emerge from the ruins of the city on Thursday, as Iraqi troops escorted haggard families from narrow lanes near the ruined mosque.\nMore than 860,000 people have now fled the city since the war to recapture it began on 17 October last year. Thousands of residents have returned to the now liberated east, but an estimated 100,000 more are thought to remain in Mosul’s old city, where vengeful, cornered members of Isis have been using residents as human shields.\n“Three more weeks and we’re done with them,” said an Iraqi special operations officer, speaking by phone on Thursday. “We will push them into the Tigris river.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Iraqis flee from Mosul. Photograph: Ahmad Al-Rubaye/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\nEarlier in the week, hundreds of civilians streamed past destroyed buildings and into Iraqi controlled territory, their clothes tattered and bodies covered in dust. Mothers clutched malnourished infants across their chests while men carried the elderly on their backs. Some were dragged on makeshift stretchers and others hauled on carts. One after another they collapsed in exhaustion and relief when they reached safety behind Iraqi lines.\nAs smoke from a recent airstrike loomed in the distance, an old woman dressed in a long black dress ran with hands outstretched toward to two young Iraqi soldiers standing alongside an army Humvee, kissing them on their cheeks. A few metres away a man stood in the middle of the street and cried while holding his young daughter. Tears flowed down his face and through his dark black beard.\n “We are seeing these stories of suffering with our own eyes every day,” said the Iraqi officer. “These people have been through hell. And after [the end of Ramadan] we hope to give them their lives back. God willing this curse will soon leave Mosul.”\n"

        "text": "\nTheresa May and Jeremy Corbyn’s campaigns will trade blows over defence and foreign policy on Friday.\nCorbyn will give a speech in London announcing a fresh approach to international affairs, saying a Labour government would not hold hands with Donald Trump.\nHis remarks are an implicit attack on May for her decision to have a close relationship with the new US president and signs that she could allow the UK to join bombing raids on the Syrian regime if asked to do so by Washington. She allowed Trump to hold her hand on her first trip to see him at the White House in January.\n\n\n\n\nLabour's draft manifesto: key policies analysed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn his speech, Corbyn will say he is “not a pacifist” but he will argue that military intervention has become “almost routine in recent times”. Foreign policy aiming at a more peaceful world has long been one of his personal priorities, especially support for unilateral disarmament and Palestinian rights.\n“Pandering to an erratic Trump administration will not deliver stability … So no more hand-holding with Donald Trump; a Labour government will conduct a robust and independent foreign policy made in London,” he will say.\nA draft of Labour’s manifesto leaked on Wednesday night said the party would place “peace, universal rights and international law” at the heart of foreign policy, while committing to meeting the Nato target of spending 2% of GDP on defence and to maintaining the Trident nuclear deterrent.\nLater, May will give a speech in the north-east arguing that Labour voters in the party’s northern heartlands are “increasingly looking at what Corbyn believes in and are appalled”.\nOne of her ministers has attacked the Labour leader on the issue of security, saying Corbyn is only “pretending what he’s got to keep us safe” after a lifetime of trying to disarm Britain.\nMike Penning, an armed forces minister, said: “It’s nonsense – we know he wants scrap Trident, abandon our allies and would rather talk to Daesh than strike its barbaric leader. We all want peace, but you can’t take tea with terrorists who order attacks on innocent civilians on our streets.”\nHis comments appear to be an allusion to past news stories about Corbyn having invited former members of the IRA to the House of Commons and an event at which he once referred to “friends” from Hamas and Hezbollah. Corbyn has since said he regrets using the term “friends” but was just trying to use inclusive language, and argued he was ahead of his time in wanting talks with the IRA to stop the violence in Northern Ireland.\nCorbyn has long opposed the Trident nuclear deterrent and has previously suggested the UK should withdraw from Nato, but neither of these approaches are party policy under his leadership. \n"

        "text": "\nIn early June, the British Islamic State member Sally Jones joined an exodus of jihadists from Raqqa as Kurdish and Arab forces closed in on the once impregnable capital of the terror group’s so-called caliphate.\nWith her on the long march were foreigners and their families who had been based in Raqqa throughout Isis’s meteoric rise and then bloody decline. Many had arrived at the height of its powers from mid-2014. Less than three years later they were engaged in an ignominious retreat.\nDuring her years with Isis, Jones, dubbed “the white widow”, had become one of the group’s most senior females, given the job of indoctrinating other women, as part of the Anwar al-Awlaki brigades, and sending some on suicide missions. Killing her had been a priority of both US and UK intelligence, which had painstakingly tried to dismantle the group’s external operations capacity which was tasked with carrying out attacks abroad.\n\n\n\n\nRaqqa: a journey into the destroyed heart of the Islamic State capital\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the run, along with thousands of other foreigners, she was finally tracked to near the Syrian border. Washington and London are confident, but not certain, that Jones was killed. The fate of her 12-year-old son, Jojo, remains unclear. If her death is confirmed, Jones would join a handful of other British nationals killed in drone strikes. Her husband, Junaid Hussein, believed to be the head of Isis’s digital security unit, was killed near Raqqa in mid-2015. Ruhul Amin, from Aberdeen, and Reyaad Khan, from Cardiff, have also been killed by drones in the past two years. \nWith Raqqa now thought to be around two weeks away from completely falling to Kurdish and Arab forces, the ranks of Isis’s most hardcore foreigners have been steadily disintegrating. Another Briton, Jack Letts – dubbed “Jihadi Jack” – was captured in the deserts north of Raqqa in the summer. He, like dozens of other foreigners, remains in Kurdish captivity in north-eastern Syria. Further east, drone strikes and special forces operations have intensified as what remains of Isis’s organised elements tries to regroup in both Deir Azzour and Mayedin.\nA journey to the Turkish border, which up to 271 French members of Isis have mostly used to get back to France over the past two years, now costs $20,000 a person – almost 10 times what smugglers were charging for the same journey a year ago. Dozens of Isis members, including senior officials, are known to have paid the price, with many making it as far as Idlib in northern Syria, but they are unable to cross the frontier.\nIn Deir Azzour, which remains besieged by a mixture of US-backed Kurds and Arabs, Russian special forces, Iranian-backed militias, including Hezbollah, and some Syrian regime units, up to 375 ideologically committed foreigners are thought to remain. Intelligence officials estimate that around half are French speaking – from Tunisia, Morocco, Algeria or France itself.\nIraqi officials believe that more than 30 British Isis diehards have made it to Mayedin, where the group’s senior leaders have also taken refuge. Some of the foreign fighters have also moved to Bukamal on the Syrian/Iraqi border. Yet more have attempted to blend in with refugees now fleeing Deir Azzour and Karama, near Raqqa.\n\n\n\n\nThe fall of Raqqa: hunting the last jihadists in Isis's capital of cruelty\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“They don’t get far. We find them quickly,” said Mustafa Bali, head of military communications for the Syrian Democratic Forces (the US-backed umbrella group of Kurds and Arabs). “They are captured and sent to the intelligence people.”\nIn what remains of Isis-held Raqqa, around five square kilometres in the far south of the city, a string of desertions in the past week have allowed Kurdish-led groups to make rapid advances, including into the Clock Tower square in the east which had been emblematic of the organisation’s tyranny.\n“The sniper’s alley was 400 metres, and it cleared quickly,” said Jamal, a Kurdish rebel in a telephone call on Thursday. Kurdish forces are planning to use the Clock Tower square to claim their victory in Raqqa, but first need to capture the hospital and sports stadium in the west of the city, which are both still in Isis hands.\nUp to 1,000 civilians are thought to remain in areas that Isis still holds. Many are being used as human shields to prevent airstrikes. “They know that the planes won’t bomb if they see women and children,” said Elyas, a Kurdish officer at the east Raqqa frontline, last week. “If these people try to escape they often get shot. A few weeks ago there was an argument between the Syrian Isis members and the foreigners. The Syrians wanted to give up, but the foreigners wouldn’t let them. They all know it’s over.”\n\n\n\n\nIs the targeting of Isis member Sally Jones legally justified?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the symbolism of the clock tower will offer a tangible sign of victory – the British executioner Mohammed Emwazi, known as “Jihadi John”, was killed there in 2015 – the sports stadium is considered to be of more intelligence value. The arena, which has been largely unscathed by airstrikes, was used to store weapons and plan attacks far beyond the fast-crumbling caliphate, particularly after the fall of al-Bab to Turkish-backed opposition groups this year. Attacks targeting France were thought to have been among those planned in the stadium by battle-hardened French ideologues and Iraqi veterans of the group.\n“What is left of these guys now is something that we feel we can work with,” said a senior western diplomat. “What we don’t really know is how many of their kind have gotten to Europe and are ready or willing to act on instructions. We are confident though that we can stay on top of many, or most of them. They have limited means to communicate. They have less places to hide.”\n"

        "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/11/intersectionality-not-while-feminists-participate-in-pile-ons",
        "text": "\nDespite mainstream western feminism’s claims to embrace them, it is becoming apparent that the radical origins of terms like “identity politics”, “women of colour”, and, in particular, “intersectionality” – which were concerned not only with race but with overturning all forms of exploitation including class systems – are being betrayed and stripped of their interrogative nature.\nAs outlined by Kimberle Crenshaw, intersectionality is not so much something that someone “identifies” as, but a useful term that easily illustrates certain truths; namely that when multiple forms of oppressions meet, they create new, compound oppressions that are experienced acutely by those who belong to certain marginalised groups.\n\n\n\n\nIntersectional-what? Feminism's problem with jargon is that any idiot can pick it up and have a go\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnmoored from structural analysis, intersectional feminism is fast becoming a shallow buzzword that elevates the individual, stifles dissent, and, most worrying, is being weaponised to silence women of colour.\nRepresentation and diversity, for instance, can be important indicators of social progress. In feminist discourse however, they are increasingly served as substitutes for such progress. The giddiness surrounding Hillary Clinton as almost First Female President™ and the silliness over Wonder Woman as First Female Superhero™ both fostered an atmosphere of hostility to any women who had the audacity not to feel “represented” by either.\nYou weren’t “With Her”? No, it’s not because you’re an Arab woman who balks at Clinton’s fondness for bombing the Middle East; you just have internalised misogyny. Think Wonder Woman was average and kinda sexist? Too bad; she empowers ALL women. And don’t even consider bringing up Gal Gadot’s pro-IDF sentiments, that makes you a “racist.”\nFor all its talk of intersectionality, mainstream feminism still cannot comprehend that racism and sexism are not experienced separately but simultaneously.\nAs such, for those of us negotiating these two particular intersections, enjoyment of, say, The Handmaid’s Tale was tempered by the gushing feminist accolades hailing it a terrifying glimpse into a future that might happen. Never mind that Aboriginal women continue to have their children taken from them by the state, or the hundreds of years that black women’s bodies were mined to perpetuate slavery and colonialism.\nMeanwhile, the First Female Doctor Who™ was greeted so rapturously, you’d think she’d won the US election. It also completely overshadowed the casting of Arab-Canadian actor Mena Moussad in the upcoming live action Aladdin. Yes, Moussad is a man. But after decades of depictions as terrorists, religious fanatics, and barbaric illiterate extras in their own lands, an Arab is again a leading man.\nThis significant event for many Arab women living in the west, who also suffer as a result of these stereotypes, was deftly swept aside as feminism celebrated the apparently unusual practice of granting a starring role to a white actress.\nThis is how whiteness reasserts itself, by sweeping the concerns of non-white women aside on the mistaken assumption that we too can separate our gender from our race.\nNowhere is it more apparent than in internet call-out culture. As we’ve written before, feminism cannot be involved in collective, meaningful change that benefits us all as long as it considers the internet pile-on bonafide political activism. Piling on individuals until they submit, may be the easiest way to express solidarity, but, in the long-term, it is actually one of the least effective.\nWe gave our best efforts to bring these ideas and concepts to light recently, at an event in which we jointly appeared, only to ironically fall afoul of this same call-out culture the very next day. A simplistic critique of our discussion ended with the erroneous and bizarre conclusion that we had mocked fat women and called them “whores”.\nWhat we’d actually said is that feminist discussions around the online abuse women face are, unsurprisingly, dominated by white women who inevitably focus on the attacks men make on women’s appearance.\nFat. Ugly. Slut. Unfuckable.\nAll feminists have experienced these slurs. What we added, and what is frequently ignored, is that our abuse is always racialised as well as gendered.\n\n\n\n\nIf feminist Linda Bellos is seen as a risk, progressive politics has lost its way | Claire Heuchan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo the men that try to silence us, we are not merely disgusting to look at, but in Ruby’s case a “Hezbollah whore” with “clitoris envy as well as penis envy.” Meanwhile, in a country that has done everything to extinguish and assimilate Aboriginal people, Celeste is continually forced defend her Aboriginality based on how she looks.\nThis compounded dehumanisation makes our experience of online abuse exponentially worse, and it is this that led us to sarcastically remark that we sometimes wish men would treat us like they do white women and “just” call us “fat whores that are unrapeable.”\nTo have these words twisted so thoroughly by other feminists is not only distressing it is embarrassing for feminism.\nWhen, in the name of “intersectionality,” an Aboriginal feminist and an Arab feminist, who have only recently been afforded a platform, are attacked because “intersectional feminists” apparently cannot tell the difference between critiquing sexist ideas and mocking women, then we can only conclude that feminism is failing at intersectionality.\n"

        "text": "\nTortuous efforts to install a credible international body to entrench and broaden the patchwork ceasefire in Syria have partially succeeded on the second and final day of talks in Kazakhstan.\nDiscussions ended with agreement among the three sponsors of the talks – Russia, Turkey and Iran – to set up a trilateral monitoring body to enforce the ceasefire that came into effect last month.\nUnder the agreement, the three countries will act together to try to minimise violations of the ceasefire, and use their influence to urge those responsible for breaches to desist. Details about the body, due to start work in February, have yet to be agreed.\n\n\n\n\nLast Men in Aleppo review – gruelling portrait of a city without hope\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeither the Syrian government nor the Syrian opposition present at the talks in Astana signed the final document. The opposition said it would present alternative proposals. It the first time the rebels have been brought to the table since the civil war began more than five years ago.\nThe Syrian opposition now seems to have accepted that Russia, with Turkey, is seeking a peace deal in Syria since the fall of Aleppo. The Syrians do not make the same assessment of Iran’s role.\nThe opposition objects to Iran being involved in monitoring the ceasefire, arguing that its militia and its Lebanese ally, Hezbollah, were responsible for most of the ceasefire breaches in Syria. The Iranians in turn had objected to a call in the draft communique for foreign militias to leave the country.\nHowever, Turkey urged the opposition, weakened after a crushing defeat in east Aleppo, not to block the trilateral body. Turkey insists the body could prove to be a viable Russia-backed way of forcing the Syrian government and Iranians to stop the breaches.\nIn a sign of a changing mood, Mohammed Alloush, leader of the opposition delegation, said: “The Russians have moved from a stage of being a party in the fighting and are now exerting efforts to become a guarantor.” But he added: “They are finding a lot of obstacles from Hezbollah forces, Iran and the regime.”\nIran accused Turkey of stonewalling and continuing to support terrorists by providing arms and keeping its borders open for jihadis. Tehran also opposes any deal that puts Assad under pressure to step aside within a fixed period.\nIf the deal manages to cement the ceasefire in the coming days it could bolster confidence before wider talks on Syria’s political future held in Geneva under UN auspices on 8 February. Russia handed to the Syrian opposition delegation – made up of armed groups – a new paper setting out a proposed future constitution for Syria, including a path to new governing system, a referendum and elections. \nThe agreed statement also expressed a determination jointly to fight Islamic State. Jabhat Fateh al-Sham (formerly al-Nusra Front) was not included in the negotiations. Efforts would also be made to separate them from armed opposition groups covered by the ceasefire. Previous ceasefire bids have broken down due to al-Nusra being interspersed with rebel groups at the talks.\nRussia insists that the Astana talks are designed to complement and not destroy the UN process. British ministers, not present at the talks, have wished the talks well, but fear they signify a wider Russian effort to pull a settlement away from the UN to regional players. But the UN’s special envoy on Syria, Staffan de Mistura, who was present at the talks said he was satisfied all sides agreed the UN remained the primary mediator. \nDe Mistura had backed the trilateral body, saying: “The chances of success will be greater if the parties here are able to agree on a mechanism to oversee and implement nationwide ceasefire. We didn’t have it in the past, that’s the reason why often we failed.”\nPrevious ceasefire monitoring in Syria failed partly because of a lack of trust and partly to differences over UN resolutions on distributing aid and on a political transition in Syria. Nevertheless, the joint statement urges the international community to support a political process.\nIran opposes any deal that would result in Assad being under pressure to stand aside, or to agree that he steps aside within a fixed period.\nThe UK prime minister, Theresa May, will visit Ankara on Saturday where the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, will update her on the talks.\nThe outcome of the Astana talks is also significant since there now seems an acceptance in the Syrian opposition that Russia, in cooperation with Turkey, is seeking a peace deal in Syria after the fall of Aleppo. The Syrian opposition does not make the same assessment of the role of Iran.\nSyria’s rebels at Astana, largely from northern Syria, are facing battles on the ground with JFS which was until July 2016 linked to al-Qaida. After months of tension and occasional clashes, the confrontation has escalated, with JFS surrounding the headquarters of the large rebel faction Jaish al-Mujahideen in Idlib province.\nOther large factions, such as Ahrar al-Sham, Faylaq al-Sham and Suqour al-Sham, then mobilised to push JFS back. \n"

        "text": "\nIsrael’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has launched a withering attack on the European Union at a closed-door meeting of eastern European leaders in Budapest, saying the political grouping would wither and die if it did not change its policy towards Israel.\nThe remarks, caught on an open microphone, underlined Netanyahu’s often barely disguised contempt for the European political union, which has criticised Israel – and his government in particular – over issues including Jewish settlement building in the occupied Palestinian territories and the peace process.\nNetanyahu also made a rare public admission that Israel has struck Iranian arms convoys in Syria bound for Hezbollah “dozens and dozens of times”.\nThe overheard remarks were reported by Israeli journalists covering the trip.\nThe bombastic remarks, which bizarrely predicated Europe’s future on its attitude towards Israel – not one of the most burning issues on an EU agenda confronting the challenges of immigration, Brexit and economic growth – were made in a meeting with the leaders of Hungary, Slovakia, Czech Republic and Poland, whom Netanyahu urged to close their doors to refugees from Africa and the Middle East.\n“I think Europe has to decide if it wants to live and thrive or if it wants to shrivel and disappear,” he said. “I am not very politically correct. I know that’s a shock to some of you. It’s a joke. But the truth is the truth – both about Europe’s security and Europe’s economic future. Both of these concerns mandate a different policy toward Israel.”\n“The European Union is the only association of countries in the world that conditions the relations with Israel, which produces technology in every area, on political conditions. The only ones! Nobody does it,” Netanyahu said before officials realised the meeting was being overheard by reporters and cut the feed.\n“It’s crazy. It’s actually crazy,” he added, urging the leaders present to help push Europe to expedite the EU association agreement with Israel that has been held up because of current Israeli policies.\n\n\n\n\n \n\nDon't undermine the one western country that defends European values and interests\n\nBenjamin Netanyahu\n\n\n\nNetanyahu’s remarks were made following criticism of his visit to Budapest, where he has been accused of soft-pedalling on accusations against the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, for allegedly stoking antisemitism, not least in a high-profile campaign targeting billionaire Jewish philanthropist George Soros.\nNetanyahu’s comments also come in the midst of problems for the embattled Israeli prime minister at home, where he is under investigation in two police inquiries and amid an escalating corruption scandal involving his government over the purchase of German submarines.\n“I think that if I can suggest that what comes out of this meeting is your ability perhaps to communicate to your colleagues in other parts of Europe: Help Europe … don’t undermine the one western country that defends European values and European interests and prevents another mass migration to Europe,” added Netanyahu.\n“So stop attacking Israel. Start supporting Israel … start supporting European economies by doing what the Americans, the Chinese and the Indians are doing,” he said, referring to increasing technological cooperation.\n“There is no logic here. The EU is undermining its security by undermining Israel. Europe is undermining its progress by undermining its connection with Israeli innovation,” he added.\n“We are part of the European culture,” Netanyahu continued. “Europe ends in Israel. East of Israel, there is no more Europe. We have no greater friends than the Christians who support Israel around the world. Not only the evangelists. If I go to Brazil, I’ll be greeted there with more enthusiasm than at the Likud party.”\n"

        "text": "\nHezbollah has claimed responsibility for a roadside bomb targeting two Israeli military vehicles on Israel’s northern border, raising tensions that were already high after the assassination of a prominent militant in December.\nThe attack by the Lebanese group on Monday followed days of Israeli artillery fire into southern Lebanon, which resumed after the bomb attack with 20 shells reportedly fired into Lebanon after the incident.\nThe explosion occurred at about 3.15pm local time near the occupied Shebaa farms, with Israeli retaliatory fire hitting the vicinity of the Lebanese village of al-Wazzani.\nConfirming it was behind the attack, Hezbollah said it had set off a large explosive device as an armoured patrol passed in the disputed Shebaa farms area, destroying a Humvee and causing casualties among the soldiers inside. In an initial response, however, the Israeli military said it had no indications of any injuries.\nWitnesses said at least 10 Israeli shells had hit al-Wazzani shortly after the blast, causing material damage, with the pro-Hezbollah al-Manar Lebanese television reporting injuries.\nFootage of the aftermath showed a heavy pall of white smoke over the area of the border fence.\nDetails of the incident were reported by al-Manar, as well as Lebanese and Israeli military officials.\nIn the immediate aftermath of the explosion, Israeli civilians close to the northern border with Lebanon were told to remain inside and roads were closed to non-military traffic.\nAccording to Israel Defence Forces (IDF) spokesman Brig-Gen Moti Almoz, the two vehicles hit during the incident were heavy armoured vehicles including a D-9 bulldozer.\n“We have opened artillery fire, and created a smoke screen to cover the area. We are in control of the incident,” Almoz said, adding the explosion was “relatively large”.\nIsrael’s northern border has been tense since the Israeli assassination of Samir Kuntar, a prominent militant who has been associated with Hezbollah, in an Israeli airstrike on a building in the Syrian capital Damascus. Kuntar was killed in an airstrike in Damascus on 20 December which was widely attributed to Israel.\nLast week, the leader of Lebanon’s Hezbollah group, Hassan Nasrallah, publicly warned that retaliation for his death was inevitable.\nHezbollah said the unit that carried out the bombing on Monday was named after Kuntar, who was the longest serving Lebanese prisoner in Israel before he was released in 2008 in exchange for the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in a cross-border raid two years earlier.\nThe IDF chief of staff, Lt Gen Gadi Eisenkot, said later that Israel’s enemies would face “severe consequence” if they threatened its security.\n"

        "text": "\nDonald Trump’s maiden address to the UN general assembly was unlike any ever delivered in the chamber by a US president.\nThere are precedents for such fulminations, but not from US leaders. In tone, the speech was more reminiscent of Nikita Khrushchev, Fidel Castro or Hugo Chávez.\nIt did echo George W Bush’s 2002 “axis of evil” speech. That was delivered to a domestic audience, and there was little doubt that in his mind Trump was looking beyond the stony foreign faces looking up at him from the hall – where his customary pauses for applause were filled with uneasy silence – to the cheering crowds of supporters that carried to him to his stunning electoral victory, and to the centre of the world stage. \n\n\n\n\n'Scourge of our planet': An annotated guide to Donald Trump's UN speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe did not even bother to mention climate change, generally seen as the greatest threat to the planet at the UN, but viewed as a liberal hoax by much of Trump’s political base – a view he has encouraged over the years.\nThe speech struck some of the darker notes of Trump’s earlier rhetoric, like the “American carnage” he described at his inauguration in January, and his evocation of an embattled western civilisation in his speech in Poland in July.\nAll three used fear as their major key. All three bore the combative hallmark of his chief speechwriter, Stephen Miller, a nativist acolyte of Steve Bannon, Trump’s former chief strategist who has left the White House but clearly still wields formidable influence.\nLike Bush, Trump offered the world a black-and-white choice between the “righteous many” against the “wicked few” – but his choice of language was far blunter than his predecessor. There can not have been many, if any, threats to “totally destroy” another nation at a UN general assembly. He did not even direct the threat at the regime, making it clear it was North Korea as a country that was at peril.\nTrump issued the warning just minutes after the UN secretary general, António Guterres, had appealed for calmer rhetoric. “Fiery talk can lead to fatal misunderstandings,” Guterres had said in his own first general assembly address, and it was clear who those remarks were directed towards.\nTrump’s rhetoric was aimed at a jumpy and defensive regime at a time of high tension. In the aftermath of North Korea’s sixth nuclear weapons test and second launch of a ballistic missile over Japan and into the Pacific, the US has resumed overflights of the Korean peninsula by heavy bombers, even carrying out practice runs with real bombs near the demilitarized zone.\n\n\n\n\nDonald Trump threatens to 'totally destroy' North Korea in UN speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe day before Trump’s address, the US defence secretary James Mattis claimed that there were “many military options” for dealing with Pyongyang, even suggesting, cryptically, that some of those options did not put Seoul at risk.\nKim Jong-un and his regime expect to be targeted by a “decapitation strike” and have shaped their military strategy accordingly, threatening annihilation of Seoul and other targets within reach of its nuclear missiles and artillery.\n\n\n \n\n\nPlay Video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1:17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Trump warns US may have to 'totally destroy North Korea' – video\n\n\nLike Bush 15 years ago, Trump concentrated on trio of enemies: although the current president removed Iraq and added Venezuela alongside North Korea and Iran. Iran was included for being its regional role, such as its backing for the Hezbollah militia in Lebanon, and also because of the nuclear deal that Tehran sealed with six global powers in 2015, including the US.\nTrump used the green marble UN podium to pour scorn on the agreement, the signature foreign policy achievement of Barack Obama, the predecessor he so blatantly despises.\nVenezuela was targeted for the socialist policies of the Nicolás Maduro government and the erosion of its democracy, but Trump did not attempt to distinguish Venezuela’s faults from other autocratic regimes with whom Trump has sought to cultivate.\nSaudi Arabia was not mentioned. Nor was Russia, although there was, early on in the speech, a rare public expression of support for Ukrainian sovereignty.\n\n\n\n\nThe Guardian view on Trump at the UN: bluster and belligerence | Editorial\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNor was there any explanation of how the castigation of these “rogue regimes” dovetailed with the dominant theme of the first half of Trump’s speech, which was devoted to the assertion of the undiluted sovereignty of the nation state.\nSeeking to draw a sharp line between his view of international relations and those of his predecessors in the Oval Office, Trump stressed that diverse nations had the right to their own “values” and “culture” without the interference of outsiders. The UN was there as a forum for cooperation between strong and independent nations, not to impose “global governance” from on high.\nIn a briefing on the eve of the speech, a senior White House official had insisted that Trump had pondered long and hard over this “deeply philosophical” segment of his address, as it marked an important exposition of his approach to foreign policy, labelled “principled realism”.\nTrump and his administration have frequently invoked such ideas to justify the absence of criticism for Saudi Arabia, Russia and other perceived partners for their appalling human rights records.\nWith Tuesday’s address, however, Trump punched yawning holes in his own would-be doctrine, singling out enemies, expressing horror at their treatment of their people and threatening interference to the point of annihilation.\nWhat was left, when the muted applause died down in the UN chamber, was a sense of incoherence and a capricious menace hanging in the air.\n"

        "text": "\nRex Tillerson, the US secretary of state, has lavished praise on the isolated Gulf state of Qatar after it became the first regional power to sign a new memorandum of understanding with Washington on tracking the flow of terrorist financing.\n\n\n\n\nQatar diplomatic crisis – what you need to know\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQatar has been locked in a bitter month-long dispute with its fellow Gulf states for allegedly allowing the funding of terrorism and extremism. But speaking in Doha on Tuesday, Tillerson praised Qatar for signing the memorandum, and said the oil-rich country had behaved reasonably throughout the dispute.\nBut the attempt to mollify US concerns appeared not to have been enough to satisfy Doha’s rivals in the Gulf: late on Tuesday, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt announced they would maintain economic sanctions on Qatar.\nThe UAE foreign minister, Anwar Gargash, said on Twitter: “A temporary solution is not a wise one”.\n\n\nد. أنور قرقاش \n(@AnwarGargash)\nQatar crisis is about (1)absence of trust (2)extremism & terrorism (3)undermining regional stability.Solution must address all of the above\n\nJuly 11, 2017\n\n\nEgypt also upped the stakes, arguing that Qatar should be expelled from the alliance of states combatting Islamic State.\n“It is unacceptable for the coalition to have amongst its members states that support terrorism or advocate for it in their media,” said a foreign ministry spokesman, Ahmed Abu Zeid, at a meeting of the coalition in Washington. \n“The decision by Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain to boycott Qatar – a coalition member – is in accordance with that principle,” he said in a statement.\nEarlier, the Qatari foreign minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani, signed the memorandum at a joint press conference with Tillerson in Doha. \nHe claimed the memorandum agreement was unrelated to the pressure being applied by the fellow Gulf states, and had been in preparation ever since Trump called for more action to track down terrorist funding at a summit in Riyadh two months ago.\nHe added: “Today, Qatar is the first country to sign a memorandum of agreement with the US, and we call on the countries imposing the siege against Qatar to join us as signatories to this MOU [memorandum of understanding].”\nTillerson said he applauded Qatar for being the first to sign the deal, saying the work was the product of weeks of detailed discussion between experts and adding that Qatar had been the “first state to respond to President Trump’s challenge at the Riyadh summit to stop the funding of terrorism”.\nThe memorandum commits Qatar to the effort “to track down and disable terror financing”, with specific milestones set out for the weeks and years ahead.\n“The US has one goal: to drive terrorism off the face of the Earth,” Tillerson said, adding: “The president said every country has an absolute duty to make sure that terrorists find no sanctuary on their soil.\n“Together the United States and Qatar will do more to track down funding sources, will do more to collaborate and share information, and will do more to keep the region and our homeland safe.”\nFull details of the memorandum have not been released.\nSaudi Arabia is likely to argue that Qatar would not have signed the agreement without the pressure exerted by the other Gulf states. But the Saudi leaders will be angry that Qatar appears to have stolen a march on them, and will now have to sign similar deals. The US has a 10,000-strong military base in Qatar, as well as strong economic ties to the country.\nLast month, the Gulf states unveiled a string of demands of Qatar, including the expulsion of named terrorists, changes to the output of al-Jazeera – the Doha-backed broadcaster – and an end to Qatar’s support for the Muslim Brotherhood, Hezbollah and Iran.\nThe four states are expected to meet tomorrow in the Saudi city of Jeddah and will have to decide whether to use the memorandum to declare victory, or instead irritate the US by maintaining the embargo and insisting on the outstanding demands. \nTillerson is expected to be present at part of the meeting, but in a sign that he wants Saudi Arabia to rethink its position, the secretary of state said: “I think Qatar has been quite clear in its positions and I think very reasonable.”\n"

        "text": "\nMore than 5.5 million people have only minimal access to water supplies in the Damascus area owing to fighting between the Syrian government and opposition groups, the UN has said, warning that targeting water sources constitutes a war crime.\nWater from rebel-held Wadi Barada, which supplies Damascus, has been cut off since 22 December. The government has been using tankers to transport supplies to the city, but city authorities said the water had been contaminated with diesel. Most residents no longer have water coming from household taps.\nThe UN’s humanitarian adviser for Syria, Jan Egeland, said his team was being prevented from travelling to the Barada valley north of Damascus, making it impossible to tell if disruption to water supplies had been caused by Syrian government bombardment or rebel sabotage. Either way, he said, “to deprive water is, of course, a war crime since it is civilians who are affected”.\nEgeland said there was no sign yet of disease in the city and efforts were being made to ensure water continued to be supplied to schools and hospitals, but he warned that the risk of the supply being poisoned was real. \nGovernment forces, backed by Lebanon’s Hezbollah group, are fighting to recapture the area north west of Damascus, despite a nationwide ceasefire.\n\n\n\n\nSyria's food production edging nearer to collapse, UN warns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cessation of hostilities, brokered by regime-backer Russia and rebel-sponsor Turkey, is due to pave the way for peace negotiations later this month in Kazakhstan’s capital Astana. But Turkey has warned that the talks will be in jeopardy unless Iran brings Hezbollah under control. Iran, by contrast, blames Turkey for failing to control the rebel groups.\nEgeland also revealed that a total of 400,000 people had been displaced from Aleppo, Syria’s second city, and that his UN team had described “devastation beyond belief” there. \nHe said the displacement in a city of 1.5 million would take a long time to rectify, owing to the dangers posed by unexploded bombs and unsafe buildings.\nUN efforts to provide humanitarian relief throughout Syria remained blocked by a web of obstruction, Egeland added, including the need for permits from the ministry of foreign affairs, local governors and armed groups. Turkey and Russia, as guarantors of the ceasefire, had not been able to improve the UN’s access.\nEgeland said: “Russia and Turkey both said … that indeed they will facilitate humanitarian access to all civilians as part of the cessation of hostilities agreement that they function as guarantors for, and we will actively hold them accountable for their promise to help us.”\n\n\n\n\nSyrian rebels freeze peace talks after Assad abuses ceasefire\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe UN risks being sidelined in Syria, as Russia and Turkey take charge of the diplomatic process. However, the UN special envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, said he regarded the Astana talks as a way of consolidating the ceasefire and preparing the ground for UN talks he plans to convene in Geneva in February. \nDe Mistura said the UN would be attending and contributing to the Astana negotiations. He disclosed that the new UN secretary general, António Guterres, was involved in an internal UN brainstorming session for a new Syrian strategy.\nThat session will inevitably focus on the role of a US administration led by Donald Trump, plus the increasing likelihood that Syrian president Bashar al-Assad will remain in power and the possibility that Turkey, by forging a closer alliance with Russia, will make the role of the US largely irrelevant.\nTurkey said on Thursday it had the right to close a key air base used by the US-led coalition to strike jihadis in Syria.\nPresidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said closing Incirlik air base in Adana province, southern Turkey, was part of Ankara’s sovereign powers. “We always have in our hands the right to say ‘we will close it’, but as I said, the conditions will be assessed,” Kalin told the 24 TV channel.\n"

        "text": "\nIt may take time for the full story of the death in Syria of the Hezbollah military commander Mustafa Badreddine to emerge – was he killed in Damascus or elsewhere, by a car bomb, artillery shell or an airstrike? In the chaos of war, establishing even basic facts is not easy.\nBut what is certain is that he had acquired many enemies over a long and violent career. Israel tops the list, but Hezbollah’s backing for the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, widens the circle of suspects.\nSunni Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies loathe the Lebanese group as a proxy of Shia Iran, their bitter rival. Sunni rebel groups in Syria, such as the al-Qaida affiliate al-Nusra Front or less extreme Islamist outfits, would certainly have the motive and possibly the capability to strike a blow.\n\n\n\n\nMustafa Badreddine: the Hezbollah leader who left no footprints\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a macabre way, Badreddine’s demise provides a useful prism through which to view the current crises of the Middle East. Syria’s five-year war is the centrepiece of this bloody turmoil – with regional powers ranged on opposing sides – though their competition extends as far afield as Iraq, Yemen and Bahrain. \nHis career spanned the dark underside of more than three decades: from his involvement in the bombing of the US and French embassies in Kuwait in 1983, through to Hezbollah’s role in the assassination of the Lebanese prime minister Rafiq al-Hariri in 2005 – for which he was formally indicted by a UN-backed tribunal.\nBut Hezbollah’s intervention in Syria, at first clandestine and then open, has seen it play a crucial military role in support of the Assad regime, a diversion from its founding motivation as the “resistance” – as all Lebanese call it – whose original raison d’être was fighting Israel after the 1982 invasion. It is estimated to have lost up to 1,000 men since 2011.\nThere are striking parallels with the fate of Badreddine’s predecessor, Imad Mughniyeh. Haj Radwan, as he was known, was assassinated in a Damascus suburb in 2008 in a sophisticated car bombing that turned out – long after the event – to have been a joint operation by the CIA and Israel’s Mossad secret service.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Mourners carry the coffin of Hezbollah commander Imad Mughniyeh in 2008 after he was killed in a car bombing. Photograph: Hussein Malla/AP\n\n\nIsrael’s refusal to comment on the latest killing was entirely predictable, though one senior former security official hailed it as “good news”, while adding: “Remember that those operating in Syria today have a lot of haters without Israel.”\nStill, Israel has repeatedly targeted Hezbollah since the 2006 war, and has mounted repeated airstrikes against it in both Syria and Lebanon over the last five years, often targeting weapons convoys while insisting it was not involved in the conflict. It fears the opening of a new front on the occupied Golan Heights.\n\n\n\n\nLeading Hezbollah commander and key Israel target killed in Syria\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to one report, rebels of the Jaish al-Sunna group claimed Badreddine was killed in an attack on a Hezbollah operations room in Khan Touman, near the northern city of Aleppo, the scene of recent heavy fighting. Whether true or not, that hints at the scale of Hezbollah’s presence in Syria.\nThe group’s latest martyr will be mourned and praised in Beirut, Damascus and Tehran, where the “axis of resistance” is celebrated. But there will be few tears in other Middle Eastern capitals, where Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah’s secretary general, is loathed for his loyalty to Assad and his invective against Arab autocrats.\nSaudi Arabia, for example, recently cut off financial aid to the eternally weak Lebanese government because of its tolerance of Hezbollah as an armed state within a state – and the foothold it gives Iran in the heart of the Levant. \n“The killing of Badreddine is an indication of the sort of people they are,” said a senior Gulf official. “He was a hijacker and an assassin, and a commander of Hezbollah.”\n"

        "text": "\nThe Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, is expected to reject an invitation to meet Donald Trump in Washington, amid a strong emerging consensus among key advisers that there are “no conditions” for dialogue following the US president’s formal recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital.\nThe issue of how best to respond to Trump’s announcement is at the centre of a series of emergency meetings of senior Palestinian leaders, which began on Saturday. They are expected to conclude early next week with a rare meeting of the PLO central council, and have already concluded that Abbas should not meet vice president Mike Pence when he visits Israel and Palestine just before Christmas.\n\n\n\n\nIsraeli airstrikes kill two in Gaza as fallout from Trump decision continues\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfirming the decision that Abbas would not meet Pence, the Palestinian foreign minister Riyad al-Maliki said Palestinians would also seek votes on resolutions at the UN security council and Arab League. Although the US has a veto on the security council, support for drafting a resolution would be seen as pressuring the US.\nThe fraught Palestinian deliberations – which are taking place amid widespread Muslim and international anger over Trump’s unilateral move that broke international diplomatic consensus – come as Palestinian medical sources confirmed two members of Hamas had been killed in an Israeli air strike following a missile launch from Gaza, bringing the death toll in the last two days to four.\nDespite widespread fury, however, the Palestinian leader has been caught between his anxiety to avoid an escalation of violence, amid calls by some for a new intifada – or uprising – and his need to make a meaningful response.\nBut in a boost for Abbas, Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and France’s Emmanuel Macron agreed they would work together to try to persuade the United States to reconsider its decision, following a phone call focusing on the risks to stability in the region.\nThe conversation between Erdoğan and Macron followed hard on the heels of a meeting of the UN security council in which an isolated US struggled to defend accusations from European countries that its action was in breach of UN resolutions.\nAnd as the diplomatic crisis continued, an increasing chorus of voices was asking precisely what Trump had actually achieved, as evidence of damage to the US standing in the Middle East and international forums continued to mount.\nIf there was one place at the weekend where no doubt had been allowed to enter, however, it was in Trump’s estimation of what he had achieved. On Thursday, as he greeted his guests to mark the Jewish festival of Hanukkah, he indulged himself again with a moment of invited congratulation.\n“Well, I know for a fact there are a lot of happy people in this room,” he told the guests, before adding to a ripple of applause: “Jerusalem.”\nWhile Trump has been basking in both self- and mutual admiration of his decision to upend decades of US foreign policy by recognising Jerusalem – a city claimed both by Israelis and Palestinians – as the Israeli capital, across the Middle East US diplomats, their families and other citizens were contemplating the coming holidays in a region suddenly more hostile to America.\nIn Jordan and elsewhere – according to reports – diplomats’ children were advised not to go to school, other movements were heavily restricted and meetings cancelled as the anger over a 13-minute speech continued to reverberate in flag burnings and demonstrations.\nIn Israel – beyond the euphoria of the rightwing political elites – the decision was greeted with little more than an anxious shrug, the rain-slicked streets of west Jerusalem empty of celebrations even in the immediate aftermath of Trump’s declaration.\nInstead, the emotional energy has been concentrated almost exclusively on a single side – the sense of outrage among Palestinians and the wider Muslim community that Trump had sought to give away something that was not his to give.\n\n\n\n\nJared Kushner is wreaking havoc in the Middle East | Moustafa Bayoumi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere have been condemnations, statements and threats from groups as diverse as Hezbollah, Hamas, al-Qaida and Iraqi militias both against the US and Israel. But the real impact for now is more likely to be felt at a more granular level in a city where even the smallest perceived changes to its status or the status of its religious sites can detonate sudden explosions of violence.\nIn recent years there has been a wave of stabbing attacks attributed in part to fears that Israel planned to change the status of the Haram al-Sharif/Temple Mount compound, and there were two weeks of street protests this summer after Israel installed metal detectors at the entrances to the same site following a lethal attack in the same compound.\n“Jerusalem is a time bomb,” explained Hamdi Dyab, a Palestinian activist in Shuafat refugee camp, the only camp within the city’s municipal limits last week, on the evening of Trump’s speech.\n“This is an unprecedented escalation by the US president and it will detonate a third intifada. History will not have seen an intifada like this. Unfortunately it will jeopardise the interest of the US and the lives of US people all over the world if he does this.\n“The declaration has destroyed the peace process and all the agreements that have been signed. This will be met with a wave of public reaction.\n“The day before yesterday we met with Mr Abbas and we told him, as the people of Jerusalem we had won the 14 days of protests over al-Aqsa mosque [over the Israeli installation of metal detectors] and we are telling the Americans that, as the people who ran those protests, Jerusalem will always stay Islamic with its heritage and its culture.\n“We had a meeting between all the Palestinian factions in Ramallah headed by Fatah, and Hamas also. If Trump declares Jerusalem as capital of Israel an intifada will spread all over the West Bank and also including the green line.”\nFor many Palestinians last week – already deeply disillusioned with the international policies of the weak and ageing Abbas – Trump’s speech was seen as final evidence of failure.\nEven those not critical suggested the time had come for a new approach. “Abu Mazen [Abbas’s nickname] is 83 but it is time to take a courageous decision and write his name in history. They have left no choice for him. All he can do is lead a third intifada,” said Sheikh Abdullah al-Qam, a coordinator of the Jerusalem committee representing Palestinian factions in east Jerusalem.\nAnd while Israel so far does not see the risk of Abbas’s Fatah party taking the kind of active role seen during the second intifada, what it does fear is that Hamas – which called for an intifada last week – might seek to exploit anger to bolster its own position.\nMore likely still, security officials fear, is a return to the sporadic deadly violence of the wave of knife attacks, often launched by Palestinian individuals without warning, that only recently died down.\nAnother unintended consequence, and potentially more serious, is how Trump’s move will affect a wider region where Sunni Arab allies have complained about America’s declining influence even as Russia and Iran have rapidly extended theirs. In the final analysis, there is only one clear beneficiary of Trump’s controversial speech, as Aluf Benn, editor-in-chief of the liberal Israeli daily Haaretz, argued in a commentary on Friday. In it, he wrote that Trump had both helped Benjamin Netanyahu deflect attention from a series of corruption investigations, and reflected a US shift in focus from the Middle East to Asia.\n“Trump didn’t give the Palestinians anything in return,” wrote Benn, “and even weakened America’s commitment to the eventual establishment of a Palestinian state.\n“Netanyahu knows that Israel’s existence and security depend on US support, so he fears an American withdrawal. But he also knows that Israel can’t stop this process or even delay it, so instead he’s trying to mine it for opportunities to improve Israel’s position in its uncompromising conflict with the dying Palestinian national movement. Trump’s speech on Wednesday was just such an opportunity.”\nWriting for the Israeli site Walla, Amir Oren was even more damning, warning that Trump’s declaration would have a “cost in blood”, either in the form of a “Trump intifada” or in a series of terror attacks.\n“Every needless fatality that follows in the wake of this childish whim … will be Trump’s responsibility, and indirectly the responsibility of those who encouraged him, by action or inaction.”\n"

        "text": "\nYour second leader (A nuclear armed rogue state is bad but war would be worse, 4 September) states: “It is in the nature of paranoid autocrats like the Kim dynasty never to be satisfied with the security they have.” But if we look at the nuclear arsenals of the western powers from Kim’s point of view, his paranoia begins to look more like a rational response: what is good for the west’s security must also be good for North Korea’s. On 7 July, 122 nations endorsed a United Nations treaty to ban all nuclear weapons. The nuclear-armed states boycotted the entire proceedings. How might Kim have reacted if instead they had been there and signed up?Caroline WestgateHexham, Northumberland\n• As you say: “To talk of nuclear weapons in rational terms ... is always slightly misleading.” The UK is supremely unqualified to teach a lesson in rationality to North Korea, since successive British governments have for decades been afflicted with exactly the same delusion as Kim Jong-un. He may think the rest of the world is in awe of his weaponry, whereas in fact his posture is regarded as ridiculous. Viewed from other countries the UK’s sense of its importance in depending on nuclear arms is equally ridiculous. What would impress the rest of the world would be our voluntarily scrapping them.Anthony MatthewLeicester\n• We’ve heard President Trump’s announcements that “the time for talks is over, they do not work”. Actually, history says they have worked several times. The first occurred in 1992, when the North and South signed the declaration of denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula. This included a joint inspection agency, like ABACC for Argentina and Brazil, to inspect nuclear facilities in both countries. The second was the agreed framework of 1994 that resulted in a cessation of North Korea’s nuclear programmes in exchange for the US’s agreement to build two PWR nuclear reactors. This lasted until 2002, when claims of faults by both sides brought its end. Next there were a series of six-party talks in Beijing, beginning in 2003, that produced an agreement to abandon all North Korean nuclear weapons programmes and return to the non-proliferation treay. A young physicist in my group at Los Alamos was a technical adviser to these talks. I believe the failures of these actions were partially due to US demands to deal with other activities it did not like. The success of the recent Iran nuclear talks is partly because the negotiating states dealt with Iran’s nuclear programme alone, without attaching other points such as Iran’s support of Hezbollah.Dr Douglas ReillyLos Alamos, New Mexico, USA\n• What hasn’t been discussed is how British nuclear designs have been purloined by North Korea to build production plants for its nuclear explosives. There is evidence that the British Magnox nuclear plant design – which was primarily built as a military plutonium production factory – provided the blueprint for the North Korean military plutonium programme based in Yongbyon. Here is what Douglas (now Lord) Hogg, then a Conservative minister, admitted in a parliamentary reply in 1994: “North Korea possesses a graphite moderated reactor which, while much smaller, has generic similarities to the reactors operated by British Nuclear Fuels plc. However, design information of these British reactors is not classified and has appeared in technical journals” (Hansard, 25 May 1994).\nThe uranium enrichment programmes of both North Korea and Iran also have a UK connection. The blueprints of this type of plant were stolen by a Pakistani scientist, AQ Khan, from the Urenco enrichment plant in the Netherlands in the early 1970s, according to US researcher David Albright. This plant was – and remains – one-third owned by the UK government. The Pakistan government subsequently sold the technology to Iran, which later exchanged it for North Korean Nodong missiles.\nA technical delegation from the AQ Khan Research Labs reportedly visited the secret enrichment plant in the summer of 1996. Hwang Jang-yop, a former aid to former president Kim Il-sung (the grandfather of the current North Korean president) who defected in 1997, revealed details to Western intelligence investigators, according to Deception: Pakistan, the United States, and the Global Weapons Conspiracy (2007). History tells us the globalisation of nuclear energy has been a reckless mistake.Dr David LowryFormer director, European Proliferation Information Centre\n• A letter last week (Letters, 1 September) called on the UK to join the UN treaty banning nuclear weapons and pursue a leadership role to enhance security in the world. Unfortunately, there is no chance that the UK would unilaterally give up Trident. On the other hand, giving up Trident as part of a global treaty joined by all the nuclear states is not only feasible, but is a requirement of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. I wrote to the prime minister and asked her to reconsider the government’s position on the UN treaty. Her defence secretary, Michael Fallon, answered by saying that the treaty risks undermining and weakening the NPT. This hypocrisy undermines the truth. The NPT came into force in 1970 and requires the nuclear states to pursue negotiations on a treaty to ban nuclear weapons at an early date. After nearly 50 years the nuclear states are clearly in breach of this legal obligation. Theresa May recently condemned North Korea for acting illegally. She was right to do so but we should not forget that she was a pot calling the kettle black.Jim PragnellOtford, Kent\n• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com\n• Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters\n"

        "text": "\nThis week we commemorate 80 years since the famous battle of Cable Street, in which the labour Zionist youth movement I grew up in, Habonim, stood shoulder to shoulder with anti-fascists and leftwing demonstrators to prevent the British Union of Fascists from marching into the Jewish East End.\nAs the labour movement celebrates this milestone in the struggle against fascism and antisemitism, it is also faced with an inquiry into bigotry closer to home: the Chakrabarti report.\n\n\n\n\nThis antisemitism report deserves Labour’s calm, close attention. No chance | Keith Kahn-Harris\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong other findings, Chakrabarti correctly identified “Zio” as a term of racist antisemitic abuse. Yet the word that the insult is derived from – Zionism, a belief in the right of the Jewish people to self-determination – is an ideology that has enjoyed a long and proud history of support from the British labour movement.\nThe year before the battle of Cable Street, the future Labour prime minister Clement Attlee noted that Labour party conferences would “never falter” in their “active and sympathetic co-operation” with the Zionists. According to Attlee, Nazism and fascism demanded that this support was “all the more necessary”.\nIn the same year, the future president of the World Trade Union Conference, George Isaacs, called upon the Trades Union Congress to extend its blessing and help to the Jewish people in building, “a new Jerusalem in Palestine”.\nThe labour movement saw in Zionism the manifestation of its own ideals, as persecuted and downtrodden Jews fought for their equality among the nations. In so doing, they were struggling against history and prejudice, and liberating themselves while building a progressive and egalitarian society. Yet despite this support for Zionism and staunch opposition to anti-Jewish racism, parts of the left have never been wholly immune to the disease of antisemitism.\nThe 19th-century utopian socialist Charles Fourier regarded Jews as “parasites, merchants, usurers”. His fellow French socialist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon wrote: “The Jew is the enemy of humankind. They must be sent back to Asia or be exterminated.” Russian revolutionary Mikhail Bakunin described the Jews as “comprising a single exploiting sect, a kind of blood-sucking people.” Even Karl Marx – his parents being baptised Jews – equated the Jewish spirit with “huckstering”. For many, it is very comfortable to view antisemitism as belonging solely the domain of the far right, yet reality shows otherwise.\nToday, leftwing antisemitism often conceals itself behind the mask of anti-Zionism, whereby the existence of the Jewish state is rejected, regardless of its borders. Within such a paradigm, Israel is the Jew among the nations, the epicentre of evil, and the ultimate global pariah. In this perverse view, it is the Jewish state – rather than the Jewish people – poisoning wells, spreading disease and craving the blood of gentile children.\nEven some on the left who would not use such language themselves, still march in solidarity with those who do. Hamas in its charter shamelessly blames Zionists for “the French Revolution, the Communist revolution [and both] world wars”, and calls for the murder of Jews everywhere, fuelling an indiscriminate campaign of violence against innocent Israeli civilians. Meanwhile, the leader of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, claims that it is better for all the Jews to “gather [in Israel ] from all parts of the world” so that they do not have to be chased down, for “the final and decisive battle”.\nDisappointingly, the response in some parts of the labour movement is not to say, “These are the antisemites we oppose”, as their heroes did in 1936, but rather “These are our comrades, with whom we stand in solidarity!” And so the bellowing cries, “We are all Hezbollah now,” or “From the river to the sea Palestine will be free” – a barely concealed call for genocide – echo menacingly through London.\nCable Street teaches us that the labour movement must completely unshackle itself from the prejudices expressed by Proudhon and Bakunin. It is one thing to savour the memory of marching down Cable Street against the British Union of Fascists 80 years ago. But if today you find yourself marching down Oxford Street in solidarity with the antisemitic Islamists of Hamas and Hezbollah, then you need to stop what you are doing, turn around, and start marching in the opposite direction.\n"

        "text": "\nTrying to piece Donald Trump’s foreign policy together, one cannot be blamed for missing the grand strategy in it all. Maybe Trump is a realist; or maybe he wants to dismantle the US-led international order. Perhaps he is purely a dealmaker.\nWhatever the approach, one theme is consistent in Trump’s actions and words: his desire to make US foreign policy appear as unpredictable as possible. As Trump so succinctly summarized it himself during a foreign policy speech in April 2016: “We have to be unpredictable.”\nCall it a “doctrine of unpredictability”, if you like.\nTrump believes that the US should pursue the foreign policy of a gambler, shedding the more “predictable” aspects of foreign policy that have, until now, helped keep the world somewhat stable. As gambler-in-chief, Trump’s perceived unpredictability will supposedly give him leverage to negotiate anything with anyone at anytime.\nThe idea might not seem so ridiculous at first blush – after all, a good poker face is an important part of success when staring down opponents.\nBut foreign policy isn’t a poker room at a Trump casino. The only thing that a doctrine of unpredictability is really sure to do is gamble with national security – shattering alliances, destabilizing relationships with adversaries and suppressing public debate in the US.\n\n\n\n\n \n\nForeign policy isn’t a poker room at a Trump casino.\n\n\nCrafting a foreign policy of unpredictability, Trump believes, would give the US the upper hand in its dealings around the world. This strategy is premised on the notion that friends and enemies alike should not know what the US would do in any given situation. As Trump once put it: “I don’t want them to know what I’m thinking.”\nThis is a terrifying prospect for those around the world who rely on American leadership to underwrite global peace and prosperity.\nHis foreign policy of unpredictability would mean raising questions about US commitments to allies from Europe to Asia. When asked about US alliances with Japan and South Korea, Trump said: “There is going to be a point at which we just can’t do this anymore.” When asked about Nato, his sarcastic response made it clear that he believes that the US is committed to too many alliances: “We defend everybody. When in doubt, come to the United States. We’ll defend you.”\nThe dangers here are manifold. Undercutting US alliances emboldens adversaries to test those alliances, weakening regional stability in places like Europe and Asia where Russia and China are already worrying neighbors. \nAnd while Trump believes he can squeeze more money from US allies in an approach reminiscent of a protection racket rather than an alliance, those allies may very well come to believe they too can get better deals elsewhere. Apparently Trump is comfortable with this, as was evident from his willingness to see other countries in north-east Asia acquire nuclear weapons.\nThe consequences of this scenario could deal a blow to US national security interests. The deeply destabilizing effect the absence of alliances would have on north-east Asia, for instance, would be devastating. Likewise, a Nato without a reliable US ally could be the straw that breaks Europe’s back.\nMuch has been written about how Trump’s desire for unpredictability is akin to what Richard Nixon reportedly referred to as his “madman theory”. In 1968, Nixon told his adviser HR Haldeman: “I want the North Vietnamese to believe I’ve reached the point where I might do anything to stop the war.” Later, in 1969, consistent with the so-called madman theory, Nixon raised military alert levels in what some analysts believe was an attempt to rattle the Soviet and North Vietnamese leaders.\nWhile some amount of unpredictability is indeed necessary when dealing with adversaries, too much ambiguity can be destabilizing. Trump’s policy statements to date don’t leave others wondering how far he’ll go – they leave everyone wondering what his basic policy is.\nFor instance, Trump has signaled wildly different instincts on how he would deter Chinese assertiveness in the South China Sea. In a Washington Post interview, Trump stated: “I don’t think we are going to start World War III over what they did”, while in a New York Times interview he said: “Look, would I go to war? There’s a question I wouldn’t want to answer.”\nIt seems much more likely that adversaries would interpret this foreign policy of unpredictability as malleable, rudderless and unprincipled, something they can take advantage of rather than something to be feared.\nThis weakness would be exacerbated by a perception that Trump does not have a firm grasp of foreign policy. Whether it’s the “one China” policy, nuclear weapons or the difference between Hamas and Hezbollah, reading Trump’s tweets and listening to his statements make it hard to believe that he has a firm grasp of any top foreign policy issues. His use of “unpredictability” as a mask for his ignorance can only last until world events and the need for a real-time US response reveal otherwise.\nThere’s a crucial difference between employing the madman theory and being an actual madman.\nTrump’s doctrine of unpredictability will also have consequences domestically. When talking with the media, Trump has used the unpredictability excuse numerous times to evade answering foreign policy questions. If this continues as the Trump administration’s public approach, unpredictability could become a guise for withholding information from the American people.\nThe aftermath of Nixon’s presidency – including the Church committee investigations that revealed tremendous executive overreach and violations of the law – made very clear the perils of a president and an executive branch that doesn’t believe in transparency in the conduct of foreign policy.\nIn foreign policy, every American should demand predictability – and transparency – from the president. US national security depends on it.\nThis is an abridged version on as essay the originally appeared in Democracy Journal.\n"

        "text": "\nPut aside any image of a global terrorist in an Afghan cave or an armed camp in Pakistan’s tribal areas. Forget the triumphalism of an Iranian Revolutionary Guards commander. Kassim Tajideen arrives in a Beirut restaurant wearing a flat cloth cap and chats over a lunch of spiced fish.\nThe fact he can’t pay with a Visa card is one of the lesser disadvantages of being listed by the United States Treasury Department as a financial supporter of Hezbollah, the Iran-allied Lebanese Shia Muslim group the United States classifies as a foreign terrorist organisation.\nTen months after Iran’s nuclear agreement with world powers, its leaders complain that continuing US sanctions are deterring would-be foreign investors. Many of the remaining blocks to trade result from the US designation of Iranian entities, including the Revolutionary Guards (IRGC), as terrorist, and a major reason for this designation appears to be their links to Hezbollah. A recent Supreme Court judgment has allowed the dispersal of $2bn of frozen Iranian assets to relatives of US marines killed in Beirut in 1983 by Shia militants allied to Iran, while Treasury officials are taking steps to implement legislation introduced in December threatening to sanction any bank dealing with Hezbollah.\nA US Treasury Department spokeswoman has reiterated to Tehran Bureau that Kassim Tajideen has contributed “tens of millions of dollars” to Hezbollah. This Tajideen denies. His lawyer, Chibli Mallat, regards the process of listing as undermining the rule of law. Along with a leading Washington law firm, Mallat has conducted an extensive dialogue with the US Treasury over Tajideen’s case. While the Treasury is not required to present evidence - the details in such cases are classified as a state secret - some journalists and academics echo their charge that Tajideen is a terrorist.\nKassim Tajideen is reluctant to put a figure on the millions that his inclusion on the terrorism register since May 2009 has cost his businesses, based mainly in west Africa. But he says he has lost $8-10m with funds frozen in the US and the legal or accountancy fees incurred in his efforts to be delisted or, as he puts it, clear his name.\nA self-made businessman, Tajideen was born to a humble family in 1955 in mainly Shia south Lebanon, long before Hezbollah existed. He left school at 11. Tajideen says he has no interest in politics and has never voted; that even in Belgium, where he has nationality and where voting is compulsory, his wife filled out his ballot paper.\nHe says this indifference goes back to childhood: “I left Lebanon for Africa in 1976, shortly after the [civil] war started. I never had any friendship with politics here in Lebanon.” Over the following three decades and more, Tajideen built up a network of trading and retailing businesses, dealing mainly in foodstuffs, in Sierra Leone, Ivory Coast and Angola.\nBut in listing him in 2009, the US Treasury said Tajideen was “an important financial contributor to Hizballah (sic) who operates a network of businesses in Lebanon and Africa”, including “cover companies” for Hizballah, and who had “contributed tens of millions of dollars to Hizballah [sending] funds...through his brother [Ali], a Hizballah commander…” \nThe irony of the listing, says Tajideen, was that less than a month earlier a six-year legal process in Belgium had ended with the dropping of charges of financing terrorism and illegal diamond dealing. A Belgian court instead fined Tajideen and his wife 150,000 Euros each for financial irregularities unrelated to terrorism or diamonds. The Belgian investigation had begun with information provided by the Belgian security service, a letter from Tajideen’s Belgian lawyer Raf Verstraeten to Mallat in 2010 reveals, and ended with the conviction of Tajideen and his wife for “illegal capital gains, created by a system of underinvoicing …entirely accounted to the African customers” and unrelated to Hezbollah or “any other alleged terrorist organization”.\nSo the news from Washington in 2009 was a shock.\n“I was surprised, as I’d thought America was democratic,” says Tajideen. “A friend called me at midnight to tell me, and woke me up. The next day I saw my lawyer [in Belgium], although he didn’t know exactly what it would mean.”\nThe listing of ‘terrorist financiers’ is the province of the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), a section of the Treasury first developed in the Second World War to track Nazi assets. Its role expanded after the 2001 al-Qaeda attacks on New York and Washington as the US found that barring individuals and groups from the American financial system not only disadvantaged them but led third parties, like banks, to shun them. OFAC collates information supplied from government and security agencies, both US and foreign.\nWhen listed as a ‘foreign terrorist organisation’ in 1997 (it had been listed as a ‘Designated Terrorist’ two years earlier), Hezbollah was carrying out armed attacks on Israeli troops occupying south Lebanon. The US also suspected that both Hezbollah and Iran had been involved in the 1996 bombing of the Khobar Towers housing complex in Saudi Arabia, in which 19 American servicemen died.\nOver ten years earlier, in 1983, suicide bombers in Beirut probably linked to the group had killed 63 people, including 17 Americans, in the US embassy, and 241 marines in the US and French military headquarters. The Beirut attacks were crucial not just to how Washington saw Hezbollah but how it saw Iran, which had at the time deployed hundreds of Revolutionary Guards in Lebanon’s Beqaa valley to train Shia militants.\nWhen he was listed 26 years after these attacks, Tajideen felt no part of any conflict between the US and Iran. To clear his name, he first approached a lawyer in the US but then, dissatisfied with progress, turned to Lebanese lawyer Chibli Mallat, known as both an author and human rights practitioner, indicting Ariel Sharon in Belgium for crimes against humanity and launching a campaign in 1997 to indict Saddam Hussein. His magnum opus is perhaps Philosophy of Nonviolence, published last year by Oxford University Press; Mallat has also offered a legal critique of the whole concept of the “war on terror” as a way of dealing with violence, writing in 2002 that “9-11 was a crime against humanity, a category which, unlike ‘terrorism,’ is well defined in international law and carries the common responsibility of humankind”.\nWhen Tajideen went to see him, Mallat set stringent conditions for his involvement.\n“I told Mr Tajideen that if he had nothing to hide and would open up all his files, there was a chance of removing the listing,” says Mallat. “I told him that if he wanted to hide anything, it was better not to start; and that if I took the case and later found any fact showing he had supported Hezbollah financially, then I would simply walk away.”\nMallat has what he calls “a history of disagreements” with Hezbollah, including his accusation that it started the 2006 war with Israel, and he has more recently told the Orient news TV channel that Hezbollah’s military support for president Bashar al-Assad in Syria is illegal.\nTajideen agreed to Mallat’s conditions and the lawyer swung into action. Mallat recalls: “I said at the meeting at OFAC that I have a reputation, that I think my client is genuine, that he doesn’t support Hezbollah and should be let off the list. I told OFAC he was ready to open whatever paper they wanted. But with OFAC, they don’t tell you what they want. It’s more, why don’t you try to do things, we’re happy to listen and to read...”\nAfter a first petition to Treasury was rejected in 2010, Tajideen also hired WilmerHale, the leading Washington law firm, and then a major international accountancy firm. The latter, according to Mallat and Tajideen, has done over 4,000 hours’ forensic investigation into Tajideen’s business affairs.\nTajideen and his lawyers began a lengthy, discursive dialogue with the Treasury, with face-to-face meetings as well as interchanging letters and documents. He wound down all his companies listed in 2009, and when he opened new ones he informed Treasury, meaning these companies have been operating even with Tajideen listed.\nThe accountants – Mallat and Tajideen will not disclose their identity, saying confidentiality is a condition of their role – drew up both for Tajideen as an individual and for his companies a series of SOPs (standards of operation), measures designed to ensure transparency. According to Tajideen, these led to significant financial losses for his companies, for example in holding local currencies at higher than desirable levels.\nThe accountants monitored the application of the SOPs and presented their findings to Treasury, including two quarterly reports submitted in 2013. This was all before Treasury relisted Tajideen in October 2015, six years after the original listing. \nA long explanation sent to his Washington lawyer was essentially a classified document of which large chunks had been blacked out. Much that was not blacked out was, according to Tajideen, factually wrong or inconsistent in describing his businesses: it confused real estate companies with other companies, confused the Chouf region of Lebanon with the south, gave the wrong number for his companies in Angola, misunderstood the nature of shell companies, and ignored many steps taken to increase transparency.\nThe document, says Mallat, justified the continued terrorism listing on the grounds that Tajideen had failed to prove his case, in other words to prove his innocence.\nThis is the crux of Mallat’s argument. In a usual legal process, the lawyer would seek to disprove a charge, and would do so by exercising his primary instinct as a lawyer: examining the evidence. But Treasury does not present evidence.\nMallat explains: “The people at OFAC say, ‘Sorry we can’t give you the evidence’. In any court of law that would be laughed at as surreal, because you can’t convict someone without presenting evidence his lawyer can rebut. The great advance of the rule of law in history is precisely to establish the basic premise that someone is innocent until proven guilty.”\nListing – without presenting evidence – is a major tactic in the “war on terror”. In an email, Mallat compares being listed to mort civile (civilian death) under the French ancien regime: “You suddenly see yourself completely shut out from basic amenities like having a cheque book, transferring money, or using a credit card. Except that this is worse, there is no due process and no available remedy.”\nTajideen’s legal team does draw satisfaction that the charges against him – according to what they say was in the Treasury letter to them of October 2015 – now have moved from giving “tens of millions of dollars to Hizballah”, as was alleged in 2009, to making unspecified donations to Hezbollah schools and employing two party members. \n“The SOPs drawn up by the accountancy firm involve higher diligence on all kinds of activities, including hiring employees,” says Mallat. “If he [Tajideen] knows they are members of Hezbollah he will fire them. Regarding the 12 schools, we have gone to land records, which show most were all established way back before Hezbollah existed, and that several are public [state] schools.”\nMallat believes this is where US policy starts to unravel. Many state employees in Lebanon – teachers, soldiers, civil servants – are members of Hezbollah. As are three government ministers, not one of whom is listed.\nTajideen’s sense of being lost in a twilight world of shadows has been increased over the years by media reports calling him a “terrorist financier”, and in particular blurring his relationship with his brothers, two of whom - Ali and Hussein - have been described by the US as supporters of Hezbollah, as indeed according to election results are hundreds of thousands of Lebanese including Christians. “We haven’t taken out legal action against a variety of claims in the media about my client because we chose a route of dialogue and co-operation with OFAC,” says Mallat. “Suffice to say, there are a number of media claims based solely on Treasury statements or on hearsay.”\nThere is evident circularity between media reports, books, the Treasury and what is more or less gossip. The fullest published account of Tajideen is in Hezbollah: the Global Footprint of Lebanon’s Party of God, a book written by Matthew Levitt, director of the Stein Program on Counterterrorism and Intelligence at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, who is a former Treasury counter intelligence official and who in March testified before Congress on Hezbollah. Levitt has also recently been appointed associate fellow of the Henry Jackson Society, who describe him as “a leading authority on illicit finance related to terrorism” .\nA section in Levitt’s book features Tajideen and is sourced almost entirely to Treasury press releases and the strongly anti-Hezbollah NOWLebanon website. \nLevitt’s account of Kassim Tajideen’s arrest in Belgium in 2003 refers to charges of “large-scale tax fraud, money laundering and trade in diamonds of doubtful origin, to the value of tens of millions of Euros”. But he does not mention that six years later, all charges related to terrorism and diamonds were dropped.\nLevitt’s book, published in 2013 and reprinted in 2015, makes great play of the links between Tajideen and his brothers, of whom two - Ali and Hussein - were listed in 2010 for “providing support” for Hezbollah, when the Treasury press release also suggested Ali was a former Hezbollah commander. \nLevitt portrays Ali Tajideen not just as a commander but as a major player in Jihad al-Binna, a construction company designated by the Treasury in 2007 for links to Hezbollah, and asserts “the Tajideen brothers” had used another company to purchase land on behalf of Hezbollah.\nHere Levitt relies on Warriors for God, a 2011 book by the British journalist Nick Blanford, in stating Ali Tajideen bought land between Jezzine and the Bekaa valley in an area, writes Levitt, where “Hezbollah was said to be building Shi’a communities aimed at linking Shi’a communities in the east near Nabatiyah with others in the west”.\n“Was said”? By whom, exactly? \nThis is what Blanford wrote: “An Iran-funded NGO, the Iranian Organization for Sharing the Building of Lebanon, which was contracted to repair war-damaged roads in the south, turned a little-used, potholed lane that crossed the mountains between Jezzine and the southern Bekaa Valley into a gleaming asphalt highway. I began hearing stories of vast tracts of land in the area being snapped up by Ali Tajieddine (sic), a Shia businessman who had made a fortune in Africa and whose alleged connections to Hezbollah in December 2010 earned him a designation on the U.S. Treasury Department’s list of terrorist financiers. In the tiny Druze hamlet of Sraireh, squeezed on to the side of a narrow valley above the Litani, a resident told me Tajieddine was paying between $2 and $4 per square meter of land, often accepting the seller’s initial asking price and paying in cash.”\nSo what are the facts?\nMallat says Levitt’s charges over land purchases by the “Tajideen brothers” conflate land bought by his client with land bought by his brother Ali: “The origins of all this appear to be in 2007 [two years before Kassim Tajideen was listed, and four years before Blanford’s book was published] when Walid Jumblatt [the Druze leader] accused the Tajideens of buying land as a front for Hezbollah. For all I know, that might have been a trigger for his listing.”\nJumblatt was, and remains, an opponent of Hezbollah. Like Mallat, he supported the Cedar Revolution of 2005 against the presence of Hezbollah’s ally Syria in Lebanon. In May 2008, when Hezbollah asserted military control over west Beirut after a dispute over security at Beirut airport, Jumblatt’s Druze militia fought back Hezbollah’s attempt to take over Druze territory, with clashes involving artillery and mortars. \nThis did not deter Mallat when he took on Tajideen’s case in 2009: “I arranged a meeting between my client and Walid [Jumblatt], which was held in Mukhtara [Jumblatt’s family seat]. Walid was sceptical at the beginning. There were a lot of maps [showing the location of land]. They met more than once, and even became friendly. It was development land. In 2011 Jumblatt wrote to OFAC saying he’d investigated the issue and didn’t think Tajideen has anything to do with Hezbollah. This is probably a different piece of land to [that referred to in] Levitt, but it’s hazy. The plot discussed with Walid [Jumblatt] has nothing to do with Jezzine [it is well to the north].”\nThe letter from Jumblatt to OFAC, then, was fully two years before Levitt published his book, and four years before he republished it. While Blanford did interview Ali Tajideen, Levitt interviewed neither brother. Nor did he quote Jumblatt. Neither Blanford nor Levitt mentioned Jumblatt’s letter to OFAC.\nKassim Tajideen says Levitt’s account is simply wrong, that while he knows his brother Ali has bought land near Jezzine “for development”, he has never himself bought land with any of his brothers. “I own land in my village, in Beirut and in Delhamiya, near Jiyeh, but up the mountain [this is the land discussed with Jumblatt]. I am developing it now, for sale.”\nKassim Tajideen’s lawyers have reported details of this land ownership and development to OFAC – all according to the SOPs. \nLevitt’s account has another interesting aspect. In January 2010, an Ethiopian Airways passenger jet heading for Addis Ababa crashed into the sea after taking off from Beirut. Among the 90 killed was Hassan Tajideen, a fourth brother, who was flying back to Africa with four employees from his food importing company, Arosfram.\n“Speaking to the press at ‘the Hezbollah equivalent of a state funeral’,” wrote Levitt, “one of Hassan’s cousins said Hassan ‘had been living in Africa for over 30 years. He was a successful businessman, with ties to Hezbollah, a movement he strongly supported’.”\nLevitt sources this to two articles on the NowLebanon website, one by Mona Alami that included a picture of the funeral. A second was written by Tony Badran, a research fellow at the Washington-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies, where Levitt acts as an adviser: this alleged Kassim Tajideen was part-owner of Arosfram (although Badran gives the name as Arosfran).\nKassim Tajideen laughs at the notion his brother Hassan received a Hezbollah funeral, even if party officials were there, as would be common in south Lebanon: “There were many people there, especially as he was the first person [who had died in the crash] to be buried.” Tajideen says he has never heard of Ali Badran, the “cousin” quoted by Mona Alami, and points out that the blue baseball caps worn in the picture of the funeral printed in NOWLebanon are those of the municipality, not the yellow ones worn by members of Hezbollah. \nKassim Tajideen does not deny that his brother Ali supports Hezbollah. But he says he does not know what role, if any, Ali has in Jihad al-Binna, and doubts he was ever a military leader: “If he were a commander, anyone would know, even a small child. If someone is a commander, can he be in his office all the time, and have 50-60 engineers or whatever working in his construction company?”\nBut Tajideen’s wider point is that he is not responsible for Ali, or any other of his brothers. “I cannot answer for them. And after all, isn’t the brother of [Osama] bin Laden a business partner of the Bush family?”\nNonetheless, after he was listed in 2009, Tajideen says he broke off all business links with his brothers and even reduced social contacts. “Of course I see them at family gatherings, like the funerals of my father and mother.”\nThe whole story leads back to west Africa, where Lebanese fleeing poverty at home began arriving in the nineteenth century. The Lebanese have vied with the Irish as the world’s largest diaspora, and their remittances home still make up around a fifth of Lebanon’s economy.\nThere was nothing unusual, then, in Kassim Tajideen going to west Africa. Nor was there anything usual in his doing business with his brothers, which is common among the Lebanese. And in Africa of the 1970s and 1980s, with instability and lack of effective government, business practices were far less transparent than in the west.\nWhen Kassim Tajideen recalls arriving in Africa in 1976 as a young man of 21, his entrepreneurial juices are very evident.\n“I started in Sierra Leone where I had family, my mother’s brother. They and other Lebanese had been there a long time, some back to the 19th century. They had a shop, and I helped. In the beginning, I had to learn. My family helped me, and when I knew a little of the business, I opened my own shop, in Kenema, the southern city. I was 23.\n“After a few years, Hassan, my younger brother [later killed in the plane crash] came to join me and I opened in Freetown [the capital]. We each ran a shop. Business was easier then, people gave you more credit, especially if you had a good name. In the beginning, in Kenema and Freetown, we used to buy locally – food, sugar, rice, vegetables, oil. We bought and sold locally.”\nTajideen later brought out another brother, Hussein, and opened more shops. In 1986 he moved to Cote d’Ivoire and in 1989 opened a headquarters in Belgium. Conditions in west Africa were far from easy with instability in Sierra Leone that would lead to full-scale civil war in 1991, but Tajideen managed to succeed.\n“Communications were a challenge, money transactions and transfers were hard, I saw we needed an office in Europe. Being a European company was seen as an advantage. Africa was only telexes, even the fax was only just starting. It was easier in Europe to open LCs [letters of credit], and having an office in Europe helped our expansion in Africa. I went to Angola because the [civil] war finished [in 1992] and as a businessman I could smell business.” \nGiven the difficulties of transferring money and enforcing contracts, and the lack of a functioning banking system, much business in Africa worked on trust. Trading partners often balanced out payments over time rather than transporting cash. With central banks lacking foreign exchange, diamond traders were one means of transferring payments.\n“Ahmad [another brother] was in Congo. If he couldn’t finance some goods, I might put money and have some profit [in return]. It [co-operation with my brothers] was by deal, not partnership or joint ownership. When they had a shipment of rice and could not finance it, I would. With brothers, you trust each other, and you may not always have detailed official records. I dealt with registered diamond traders who had a licence to export and import, in Africa and Belgium, as a means of transferring money.” Tajideen insists he did not personally buy or sell diamonds, simply using diamond dealers to make financial transfers.\nBut diamonds figured in the start of Tajideen’s listing saga, in the initial charges he faced in Belgium back in 2003. He was visiting home in Lebanon at the time, and took a phone call from an employee in Belgium who said a colleague and the company accountant were in jail. Both Tajideen and his wife went voluntarily to Belgium, where they were arrested.\n “My wife flew to Belgium before me, went to the police, and was kept there. When I followed three days later and reported to the police they told me to come back the next day.” \nTajideen suspects the arrests resulted from information slipped to the Belgian authorities by a commercial rival. But this did not diminish their seriousness.\nThe arrest warrant referred not just to blood diamonds from Angola. Tajideen was also alleged to be financing Hezbollah as well as an obscure organisation, the Arab European League. The charges were enough for Tajideen to be held for five months in jail under emergency legislation.\nBut he was then released. It took six years for most of the charges to be dropped, a period when Tajideen stayed mainly in Belgium, although he retained his Belgian passport and travelled internationally, including to the US and Lebanon.\nWhen he and his wife were finally convicted of laundering and forging documents, the Belgian court made clear this was not linked to any ‘terrorist’ organisation or to diamonds. Tajideen and his wife faced a 150,000 Euro fine for financial irregularities, a small percentage of their losses through disruption to their businesses. \nBut then came the US listing, and this had a far bigger impact on his businesses, probably costing hundreds of millions. Among his suppliers had been Tyson Foods, one of the world’s largest food processors. \n“Any US company wanted to come to Angola, they contacted us - we organised a hotel, showed them places,” says Tajideen. “The USDA [US Department of Agriculture] used to send us suppliers, because they liked us and saw we were reliable, that we paid on time. \n“We became the agent for Tyson in Africa for ten to 15 years, building up in the last five or six years to $100m [turnover] a year. They used to visit us in Belgium and Africa, I used to visit them in Atlanta. When my son and daughter went, Mr Tyson gave them his plane to go see the plant.”\nA sense of being let down by the US is shared by one of Tajideen’s sons, Hussen, 30, who has followed his father into business, inheriting not just his acumen but the consequences of his listing.\n“Recently I wasn’t allowed to transfer money from one of my accounts here [in Lebanon] to one of my accounts overseas,” says Hussen. “Another bank I went to made me close my account. My sisters and her kids, who are 12, ten and seven, had to close their accounts, because they are his [Kassim’s] grandchildren.”\nWhere the case goes now is anyone’s guess. When Tehran Bureau approached the US Treasury, a spokeswoman declined to confirm or deny various points put to them – including whether the department had met representatives of Tajideen, whether it had exchanged letters and documents with them, whether it had received results of forensic accountants’ examination of his business affairs, and whether it had received a communication from Jumblatt expressing his conclusion that Tajideen was not linked to Hezbollah. The Treasury spokesman refused to explain what was meant by a “Hezbollah school” or why Tajideen was listed while three Lebanese government ministers in Hezbollah were not.\n“We stand by the press release of 2009, which notes that ‘he has contributed tens of millions of dollars to Hizballah and has sent funds to Hizballah through his brother, a Hizballah commander in Lebanon’,” the spokeswoman said. “We do not have any additional details on Kassim Tajideen to offer at this time and we generally do not comment on the possibility of future actions, engagement with specific SDNs, or delisting requests except with the parties themselves and their counsel.” \nIn the jargon, an SDN is a “specially designated national”. Treasury has a long list. Back in Beirut, Kassim Tajideen is finishing his lunch and pauses, in silence, before Arabic coffee arrives. He’s clearly left wondering what more he can do, but as a man who succeeded in business in west Africa it’s hardly surprising he’s not afraid of looking me square in the eye.\n“I’m a Muslim, and I’m from the south of Lebanon,” he says. “Should I change my name? Will that solve the problem? The Americans have records of everybody, they know us very well. If somebody is lying, you know. Maybe you can’t be 100% sure, but most often you can tell.”\nThe Tehran Bureau is an independent media organisation, hosted by the Guardian. Contact us @tehranbureau.

        "text": "\nAs the green surrender buses trickled out of Aleppo last Wednesday, Bashar al-Assad’s two biggest backers reacted very differently.\nRussia, which had brokered the deal with Turkey to allow the refugees to leave, was urging the convoy on towards the countryside, where the first of the city’s final refugees were to be disgorged. Iran, on the other hand, was looking for ways to stop it.\nTo Moscow, the ceasefire was the pinnacle of Russia’s intervention in Aleppo, a moment when it could mount a new case as a peacemaker, after bombing opposition groups to capitulation for 15 months. To Tehran, allowing remaining civilians and rebel fighters to leave was a potential loss of leverage – at precisely the time that Iranian influence on the battlefield had started to eclipse that of Russia’s.\nThe divergence marked a seminal moment in the Syrian war; the mutual interest in securing Assad that had brought the two countries together had suddenly given way to a feud about who calls the shots now that the war is nearly won. The Russian air force matters little now. The Iranian revolutionary guards count for more.\nBesieged populations have been bargaining chips throughout the six-year conflict, and Iran has played a direct role in turning the fate of cornered opposition communities into political victories that secure Assad and strengthen its own hand.\nAllowing the last desperate holdouts of Aleppo to leave, without first seeking terms, was not in the Iranian playbook. And, within hours of Turkey and Russia announcing a deal, Iran had sabotaged it, demanding the lifting of a siege of two Shia villages north of Aleppo, Fua and Kefraya, which had been surrounded by the al-Qaida-inspired Jabhat Fateh al-Sham. It also wanted a trade of prisoners and bodies of slain Hezbollah and Iraqi militants under its tutelage.\n\n\n\n\n \n\nVictory in Aleppo matters enormously for both sides, but when the dust settles in Aleppo, it counts for more in Iran\n\nMartin Chulov\n\n\n\nVictory in Aleppo matters enormously for both sides, but when the dust finally settles in Aleppo, it counts for more in Iran. Securing Syria’s second city and industrial heart is much less to do with re-establishing state sovereignty than about asserting its own influence and agenda in the strategic heart of the region.\nAleppo is a crossroads in Iran’s project to build a land corridor to the Mediterranean coast. It is also likely to be a new centre of Tehran’s geopolitical projection, which has been on open display elsewhere in the conflict.\nIranian officials have directly negotiated with the opposition militia, Ahrar al-Sham, about the fate of the battered opposition-held town of Zabadani, west of Damascus. Iran proposed a swap of the town’s Sunnis, who would be sent to Idlib province, for the residents of Fua and Kefraya, who would in turn be relocated to Zabadani.\n“The Iranians want no Sunnis between Damascus and the Lebanese border,” said one senior Lebanese official yesterday. “There is a very clear plan to change the sectarian tapestry of the border.”\nIn the Damascus suburb of Darayya, where opposition communities surrendered in August, and accepted being flown to Idlib, 300 Shia families from Iraq have moved in. Further to the west, near the Zainab shrine, Iran has bought substantial numbers of properties, and also sponsored the arrival of Shia families, securing the area as a bridgehead before Zabadani.\nSecuring corridors of influence with Shia communities marks, potentially, Iran’s most assertive moment since the Islamic revolution of 1979, after which Tehran’s proxies have gradually projected its influence, through Hezbollah, through the US invasion of Iraq – which switched political power from Sunnis to Shias – and now through the chaos of Syria.\nRussia’s goals have been less about ideology, and more about realpolitik. Vladimir Putin now has a renewed stake in the region, at the expense of the US, which he believes abdicated a decades-long role under Barack Obama, and which Donald Trump has little interest in reclaiming. Russian influence is likely back in the Middle East to stay. But, as America found out, it will be checked by the fervour of an ascendant regional heavyweight.\n"

        "text": "\nOn Tuesday, as Khan Sheikhun became the latest place name to be added to Syria’s map of horrors, I was sitting in the Beaux Arts splendour of the Senate buildings in Washington for an interview with John McCain, chairman of the armed service committee, former Republican presidential candidate and established hawk in the aviary of American security policy.\nMcCain was on forthright form, berating secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, for empty rhetoric and leaving the Syrians to sort out their own fate. “To make a statement that the Syrian people will determine their own future themselves is one of the most unusual depictions of the facts on the ground that I have ever heard of. What about the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, what about the Russians, what about Hezbollah?”\nA few hours later, the ghastly story of poison gas attack on the opposition stronghold in Idlib province gave us pictures of human suffering at its most vile: the dying filmed foaming at the mouth, a tangle of lifeless bodies, dead babies in the arms of a father.\nThe likelihood that this happened at the behest of anyone other than Bashar al-Assad, with the support or acceptance of his Russian allies, is negligible. Even Moscow’s supple version of events got so tangled that it ended up with a yarn worthy of a Bourne film, about the “accidental” unleashing of gas bound for terrorists somewhere else.\nThe first place to look for those guilty of chemical gas attacks is to those who have used the method before, as Assad did on a massive scale on the outskirts of Damascus in 2013. Having failed to win the vicious civil war, even with the help of Hezbollah, Iran and Russia, he is desperate and foolish enough to do it. By Thursday, Washington’s response was what it should have been in 2013 – and would also have been had Hillary Clinton won the 2016 election, namely a hefty strike on airfields to discourage Assad from another gas attack.\nA complicating factor is that this is the first major decision of international significance taken by the president to demonstrate a goal beyond self-interest or rhetorical fireworks. It convolutes an argument on intervention that has sprouted moral complexity and unintended consequences since Bill Clinton edged his way into the Bosnia and Kosovo conflicts in the early late 1990s, followed, with less settled outcome, by the Blair-Bush era of bigger stakes interventions in Iraq and Afghanistan.\nWhere these latter involvements were marked by too great a degree of self-belief by the purveyors of liberal intervention, the new variety presents the opposite conundrum. They run completely counter to Trump’s previously expressed convictions. “Policy whiplash” is the phrase doing the rounds in Washington, as the man who once declared that Syria was “not our problem” declared “no child of God” should have suffered a gas attack, with a rapid order of punitive airstrikes to follow.\nIf the Kremlin and Damascus were caught out by the swiftness of Washington’s response, so were those closer to home. So, instead of the daunting plod through a solemn “authorisation of military force” votes in Congress, the strikes happened with a very Trumpian crash, bang, wallop, directed from a “situation room” in Mar-a-Lago, a makeshift tent near the golf retreat from which America’s global interface is run. China’s President Xi showed up for his planned summit on trade, found he had stepped into another film entirely and kept a low profile.\nThe sight of Trump engaging in an interest other than his own eats away at the fundamentals of the philosophy of “America First” that swept him to the White House. Syria’s crisis is a running sore, abandoned by Barack Obama, but it is not a direct threat to the US. Reacting to it so forcefully runs counter to the general Trump doctrine that the country should focus inwardly, rather than end up bearing the world’s burdens.\nConspiracy mongers suggest that this has more to do with Trump turning on Russia, to shake off his opaque pre-election entanglements with the Kremlin. But that relationship was already heading for the deep freeze. More likely, the lord of misrule in Mar-a-Lago has done what he has done so often – confused friend and foe alike by acting purely on instinct.\nIsolationists, such as Ukip’s Nigel Farage and Paul Nuttall, both of whom vehemently oppose the airstrikes, are upset to find themselves dealing with a Clinton-Bush-Blair continuum, when they expected a withdrawal from world affairs. Trump’s Republican detractors, such as David Frum, slide quickly into convoluted critiques, which boil down to saying that Trump did not approach this decision in the manner of a more considered person. No surprise there. America’s liberal class, still in a reactive spasm to anything involving Trump, defaults to the view that even if they approve of the strikes in this case, there must be something wrong with them, which looks as morally convoluted as anything the president himself could muster.\nIn this confusion, the political spectrum bends and twists. In Britain, it leaves Farage and co ending up at the same place as Jeremy Corbyn, who is busy uttering platitudes about preferring a ceasefire to American bombings. The sole alternative put forward by the non-interventionists is to call on the atrophied muscle of the UN, which as Angela Merkel caustically noted, has a security council that had not even managed to muster a response in the aftermath of a chemical weapons attack. (Note: we should bank this as Merkel’s pitch for the UN secretary general job, should she fail to be re-elected in September.) Doubtless, the UN will arise from its torpor to tell us that it would be great if people did not slaughter their own populations but, with tiresome frequency, they do. That is why interventions still have their place, even if their thresholds have become higher since Iraq and Afghanistan. As Tom Watson and Yvette Cooper, both speaking well on this for non-Blairite middle Labour, concluded, there are good reasons to draw lines on indiscriminate chemical weapons attacks, even when deeper disagreements remain about how to handle Syria’s endgame.\nBut if Labour is, once again, divided on foreign policy, there are implications for Theresa May’s government. Britain finally committed to join airstrikes in 2015. The bitter arguments that led to the decision ended in a very small participation indeed (by the standards of British military capacity). We have become so wrapped up in our own arguments about intervention that we take ourselves a lot more seriously than anyone else.\nTwo things stand out. One is that, under the Trump administration, the number of sorties flown against mainly Islamic State targets has increased sharply from just over 5,000 last September to nearly 8,000. The other is that only a few hundred of these have featured US allies. Far from being sucked into a quagmire, a more realistic assessment of British involvement is that we are marginally relevant in such conflicts. The careful statements of “proportionality” by May and her defence secretary, Michael Fallon, are commentaries on the situation rather than meaningful acts of approval.\nOne way or another, there will be an end to the war in Syria and, in its messy, unsatisfactory way, last week’s events have brought it closer. What happens next matters a lot more than whether we approve of what has occurred in the last few days. When I asked a senior former British commander in Iraq what the jeopardy of the next crucial months in Syria entails, he said briskly: “A bugger’s muddle of powers tripping over each other – or America hitting the Russians by accident.” Dr Strangelove is never far from such scenarios. Last month, Russian aircraft mistakenly bombed Syrian Arab fighters who were being trained by the Americans, stationed only a couple of miles away. Unscheduled clashes, as the battle to retake Raqqa from Isis intensifies, constitute the bigger risk of escalation.\nTo build on the retributive strike, Washington will have to grind through the process of trying to establish a no-fly zone, against the will of an intransigent Vladimir Putin. Even Trump, the great inverter of norms, cannot escape these inevitabilities or the slog involved. To defeat Isis militarily and forestall further atrocities by a reckless Assad, America will have to commit to being part of some war-ending deal that means it remains involved in Syria.\nThe cry of the isolationist is always: “Stop the world, we want to get off”. It is a false promise and Khan Sheikhun shows us precisely why. We have no guarantee that Trump will get the next steps right, but the alternative of facilitating yet more outright war crimes by the failing Assad regime would have been far worse. That may be a modest claim for the battered doctrine of intervention against tyrants bearing sarin gas, but it is nonetheless right.\nAnne McElvoy is senior editor at the Economist\n"

Forced from home by war, this is a man who has lost everything. In a video set on infinite replay, Sarkissian is seen again and again striking his home. His is an act of utter futility, but as a survivor of war this is all that is left to him: to feign control and agency in a world where you have none.\n\n\n\n\nLebanese PM Saad Hariri suspends resignation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarkissian’s work has resonance for the Lebanese, not only because Lebanon currently hosts over one million Syrian refugees, and not only because many Lebanese continue to be tormented by 15 years of brutal and brutalising civil war, but also because of the profound untenability of Lebanon itself.\nFor three weeks now, the Lebanese have believed themselves to be marked, yet again, for invasion. On 4 November, the prime minister of Lebanon, Saad Hariri, announced his resignation from Saudi Arabia, citing assassination fears and Hezbollah and Iran’s “unacceptable influence” over Lebanese politics. Those close to Hariri repeatedly stated that the Saudis forced his resignation and then detained him. The Lebanese government and parliament took three unexpected steps. First they united, second they demanded their prime minister be returned to his country and third they accused Saudi Arabia of holding him against his will.\nLess public were the Lebanese government’s efforts to mount an international campaign to pressure the kingdom to release Hariri. Seemingly in response, Hariri returned on Tuesday to mark the nation’s independence day and, within a day of returning home, Hariri put his resignation on hold. This lends weight to the theory that Hariri was forced to resign.\nOrdinarily, the question here should be: how can one nation take another nation’s leader hostage? But not for Lebanon, as the integrity of its political and territorial borders are routinely and profoundly violated. The Saudis have warned that Hezbollah’s participation in the Lebanese government is seen as an “act of war”, not against the Lebanese people but against the Saudi kingdom itself. Ordinarily, this is an unacceptable turn of logic, but the Saudis understand that logic and international law do not apply to the treatment of Lebanon.\n\n\n\n\nSaad Hariri returns to Lebanon after surprise resignation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn all demeaning and facile analysis of proxy wars being fought out between Saudi Arabia and Iran, between Sunni and Shia forces, what is silenced is who Lebanon is and how its people are struggling with yet again the threat of aggression, violence and invasion by external forces.\nThe Lebanese, like their Syrian counterparts, have survived a litany of war horrors, but their war and the numerous border incursions is still something the Lebanese cannot bring themselves to speak about. I suspect in addition to the trauma inherent to war, there is also a sentiment among the Lebanese, best articulated by a sniper’s graffiti preserved on the wall inside the Beit Beirut museum, “I want to say the truth, my soul has become defiled.”\nThis is a country of soul-destroying poverty and ostentatious wealth, as if one is not an affront to the other. Lebanon is a nation in which international film festivals are held, citizens speak three languages sometimes in addition to their mother tongue, while children pull on your clothes begging for food. \nEverywhere in Lebanon new buildings rise up from the rubble; internationally-designed apartment blocks in Beirut make Australian apartments look like sub-standard, communist brutalist architecture. This is a nation literally being rebuilt, but even as they rebuild, the Lebanese know that at any moment their nation could fall prey to war and invasion.\nThis nation of six million has welcomed 1.5 million Syrian refugees. These refugees come from a nation that was an occupying force in Lebanon for 29 years. \nYou can visit the grounds of the International Fair of Tripoli littered with architecturally complex buildings designed by Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer. One of them was converted by the Syrian army when it was an occupying force to serve two purposes: to hold Lebanese prisoners captured by the Syrians, and to execute them against its outer wall by firing squad.\nThis is a moral complexity that the Lebanese are able to hold. It makes our own position of detaining and turning back asylum seekers morally untenable. \nWhile racism and orientalism has changed and adapted to modern sensibilities around race, what hasn’t changed is the rhetoric that all that occurs in the Middle East is a function of culture and religion. Everything from war to civil unrest to economic decline is reduced to religious hatred and tensions over identity. The Christian-Muslim, Shia–Sunni divide has come to replace any meaningful analysis of the way in which complex global and geopolitics have wreaked havoc on Lebanon and the region. Little analysis is brought to bear on the ways in which globalisation of neoliberal economic policies have devastated the economic livelihoods of many in the region. \nMiddle Eastern nations know that their security and prosperity is beholden to the politics of the US and Russia. Right now, both countries have differing visions of the Middle East, and with their different allies brought to the fore. Saudi Arabia’s current threats of violence are not so much a failure of politics as its calibration. \nHariri was widely understood to be Saudi’s man in Lebanon. There is broad consensus among Middle Eastern media that his failure to replace Iran’s “unacceptable” influence in Lebanon with their own earned him a place among the growing number of individuals currently being detained by the crown prince in his efforts to consolidate his power.\nHariri’s return to Lebanon changes only the optics of the situation; it is unlikely he is a free man. The kingdom has rendered his Saudi-based construction firm bankrupt and his family continue to reside in the country. Hariri’s return to government doesn’t mean he will play a key role in their efforts to control Lebanon. The Saudis may well find another Lebanese politician to compromise. As it is, the kingdom now appears to be on a much more aggressive footing. \nAny war rhetoric coming out of Riyadh is alarming. In pursuit of its political objectives, the kingdom has been accused of transgressing both legal and moral limits. \n\n\n\n\nThe Guardian view on Lebanon: great power rivalry in a tiny state | Editorial\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n At present, the death toll is mounting in Yemen from the Saudi-led coalition’s military campaign against the Houthis. Its current blockade of the country has resulted in seven million people being placed at risk of famine and a devastating cholera outbreak should render the blockade illegal by the international community.\nThe consequences for Lebanon of Saudi’s wrath are potentially catastrophic. The Lebanese have long understood that they lack the military and political might to hold foreign powers at bay. This is why so many Lebanese politicians become beholden to foreign governments. But this is surely when international law should most stringently be applied. However problematic Iran or Hezbollah’s influence in Lebanon is, it is for the Lebanese to resolve, not for Saudis to demand. \n\nJoumanah El Matrah is the CEO of the Australian Muslim Women’s Centre for Human Rights and a PhD student at Swinburne University\n\n"

        "text": "\nIt is sadly appropriate that the re-election of Jeremy Corbyn as Labour leader has coincided with a escalation of the appalling assault on the people of Aleppo by Assad’s regime and Russia, dropping a barrage of napalm, chlorine and barrel bombs, murdering citizens sheltering underground and destroying what remains of their hospitals and shattered medical facilities (Report, 1 October).\nIt is three years since Labour, pressured by the Stop the War campaign (chaired by Corbyn), won a vote in parliament preventing the government from supporting President Obama’s proposal to use military action to stop Assad using chemical weapons. Obama then dropped his proposal, which clearly gave Assad’s regime and Russia confidence that they could do whatever they liked to the people of Syria, with the devastating consequences we are now seeing. The current bombing is to be followed, it seems, by a massive ground assault, which is likely to see a huge escalation in mass killing. The troops preparing for this murderous onslaught come in large part from those Corbyn has called his “friends” in Hezbollah. Hezbollah has in fact invaded Syria from Lebanon and is itself an agent of another foreign power – Iran.\nCorbyn’s supporters like to tell us all that he is thoroughly decent, a man with principles. But these are principles that have enabled many on the left today to ignore and collude with what are not just war crimes (it is after all a war of the state against its own people), but also crimes against humanity, if not genocide. We now urgently need to reassert the core socialist values of solidarity with those suffering injustice, oppression and facing annihilation.Philip SpencerEmeritus professor in Holocaust and genocide studies, Kingston University\n• Jeremy Corbyn made his name as a peace campaigner. The children of Aleppo only know the peace of the grave. Corbyn looks for moral high ground to occupy rather than supporting an intervention that would have saved them. The devastating consequences of the commons vote in August 2013 still appear to be too sensitive a subject for any journalist to raise with him.Brian DevlinGalashiels, Scottish Borders\n• David Owen’s suggestion (Opinion, 30 September) that “peace in Syria is possible” through a direct Turkish military assault upon Syrian government forces is Orwellian. The US, UK, Turkish and Saudi governments have already poured billions of dollars in cash, weapons and training into rebel forces since 2012. If David would like them to escalate, he can write that, but he shouldn’t insult readers by talking about paths to peace.Daniel GreenBoston, USA\n"

        "text": "\nBoris Johnson intensified the Conservatives’ personal attacks on Jeremy Corbyn on Tuesday, accusing him of siding with Britain’s enemies in the fight against terrorism.\n“For 30 years, [Corbyn] has been soft and muddle-headed on terror. He has been soft and muddle-headed on defence,” Johnson said. “He has taken the side of just about every adversary this country has had in my lifetime, from the IRA to Hamas, from Soviet communism to [Argentina’s] General Galtieri.”\nJohnson said he did not mean to draw a comparison between the EU and nefarious regimes and terror organisations. “I don’t mean to compare our European friends to any of these people, but it is psychologically impossible to imagine him having the grip or the firmness to get the right Brexit deal for this country,” he said. \nIn a series of attacks on the Labour leader, Johnson made several claims which have been strongly denied by the party. “Jeremy Corbyn [is] at the very best weak and vacillating on terror. He says he’s now in favour of shoot-to-kill,” Johnson said. “He wasn’t until the events of the weekend. I do not see how we can trust him with the safety of our country.”\nHowever, Corbyn has repeatedly said he is in favour of the action police took to neutralise the three terrorists who attacked bystanders in London Bridge on Saturday night. \nIn a BBC interview last year, where he said he was “not happy with a shoot-to-kill policy in general”, Corbyn made clear he was referring to state assassinations, rather than police responding to a terror attack to save lives. \nJohnson also attacked Corbyn’s stance on the nuclear deterrent, though the Labour leader has committed the party to keeping Trident, despite being a committed unilateralist throughout his time as an MP.\n“A guy who pre-emptively informs any power that would threaten to engage in nuclear blackmail that as our prime minister he, Corbyn, would not under any circumstances deploy Trident, so making a making a nonsense of our nuclear deterrent,” Johnson said.\n“He is all over the place on our nuclear deterrent. We are spending £31bn on Trident. What’s the point of this thing if he wants to send it to sea with no nukes aboard, so the whole country is literally firing blanks? It would be a disaster.”\nCorbyn’s previous scepticism about Nato was also attacked by Johnson, who has been a notable absence in much of the Conservative campaign, which has centred on the prime minister. “I don’t think people in this room or around Britain realise quite how much other countries look to us and depend on us,” Johnson said. \n“We are one of the great nuclear powers of the world. We are the second biggest Nato contributor. We have a huge military presence around the world ... They would be appalled if Britain was suddenly abstracted, taken away, from the defence of Europe and of the world. And that would be the real tragedy, in my view, of a Jeremy Corbyn premiership.”\nWith polls suggesting that Labour’s vote is surging because of an enthused youth vote, Johnson said some people were voting for Corbyn because they were too young to remember communism or the IRA.\n“The trouble is young people these days – I’m 52 – do not remember nationalisation,” he said. “They don’t remember Soviet communism. They don’t even remember socialism. We don’t want it back in this country. It would be an absolute disaster.”\nLabour activists protested as Johnson arrived at Shildon Civic Hall, County Durham, and shouts of “Tories out” could be heard from within the hall as Johnson gave his speech to rows of Conservative activists. \nLabour’s Helen Goodman is defending a majority of around 3,000 in Bishop Auckland, which includes Shildon, and colleague Jenny Chapman has a similar slim majority in neighbouring Darlington. Though the area has traditionally been a Labour heartland, the Tories are hoping to win several neighbouring seats. \n“This is one of the most deprived wards in the United Kingdom,” one activist shouted. “That’s thanks to Tory austerity. There are two food banks in this town.”\nHowever, the area voted heavily for Brexit, which was the other main focus of Johnson’s speech. The foreign secretary said Labour “would arrive in Brussels like a family of herbivores at a watering hole of lions... They would be eaten for breakfast.” \n"

        "text": "\nIndirect talks between Syrian rebel factions and government representatives have opened in Kazakhstan, as Russia takes on the role of Middle East power broker.\nThe meetings, scheduled to last two days at a luxury hotel in the Kazakh capital, Astana, will focus on how to extend the ceasefire negotiated after the opposition’s crushing military defeat in Aleppo at the hands of the Russian air force and Iranian-backed militias.\nIt had been hoped the talks would lead to a face-to-face meeting between opposition fighters and representatives of Bashar al-Assad’s government. However, rebels said on Monday they had no plans for direct talks.\n\n\n\n\nMillions displaced and 500,000 dead – will new peace talks end Syria’s agony?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe talks are sponsored by Russia, Turkey and Iran. The US, the EU, Saudi Arabia and the UN are, for the moment, largely marginalised. Russia faces a new set of challenges as it attempts to move from participant in the conflict to peace broker.\nLeaders of the Syrian opposition delegation, representing as many as 12 factions, claimed on the eve of the Astana talks that Moscow genuinely wanted to move to a neutral stance but was being held back by the Iranian and the Syrian governments.\nMohammed Alloush, the leader of the opposition delegation, said the failure of Moscow to put pressure on Iran and the Syrian government to end what the opposition says are widespread violations of the Turkish-Russian brokered ceasefire would be a blow to its influence in Syria.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  UN special envoy Staffan de Mistura (back to camera) speaks to the head of the Syrian opposition delegation Mohammed Alloush (right) before the talks. Photograph: Sergei Grits/AP\n\n\n“It’s a real test of the power of Russia and its influence over the regime and Iran as a guarantor of the deal so, if it fails in this role, there will follow bigger failures,” Alloush said. “Russia wants to move from a direct party in the fighting to a guarantor and neutral one and this point is being obstructed by the Syrian regime that wants it [the ceasefire] to fail and Iran that is fighting this with its sectarian militias in Syria.”\n\nAreas of control in Syria\n\nRussia believes the talks can be more productive than previous efforts led by the UN, partly because the military balance has changed and partly because the negotiations are between the Syrian government and fighters, rather than with political leaders representing the opposition but often living outside Syria.\nThe Syrian opposition says the government and Iranian-backed militias are continuing military offensives in several areas in Syria, including in Wadi Barada, near Damascus, regardless of the ceasefire. But the opposition factions have few cards at their disposal and may have to choose between agreeing to separate from terrorist groups, such as the al-Qaida-linked Jabhat Fateh al-Sham (JFS) – formerly the Nusra Front – or face their destruction.\nSome of the worst fighting in recent days has been between opposition groups in Idlib, one of the last rebel strongholds in Syria.\nMoscow invited all the opposition fighting groups except Islamic State and JFS to the Astana talks, but the once powerful Turkish-backed Ahrar al-Sham refused to attend after a fierce internal debate. The decision leaves tens of thousands of fighters outside the talks, which was also the case when it refused to participate in the Geneva talks in 2016. \nMoscow believes the diplomatic backdrop of the Astana talks is more favourable than last spring’s abortive talks in Geneva, partly because the opposition has been weakened and divided by the Aleppo defeat. It also believes Washington under Donald Trump is interested primarily in defeating Isis, rather than ousting Assad from power.\nTurkey appeared to reverse its five-year demand for Assad to stand down on Friday, saying it could no longer insist on a resolution of the conflict requiring the Syrian president’s removal. “We have to be pragmatic, realistic. The facts on the ground have changed dramatically, so Turkey can no longer insist on a settlement without Assad. It is not realistic,” said the Turkish deputy prime minister Mehmet Şimşek. \nAnkara claimed his remarks had been over-interpreted, but many observers regarded his statement as a confirmation of the Turkish-Russian rapprochement under way for many months\nIn return for Turkish flexibility, Russia has gone along with the continued insistence by Turkey that the Syrian Kurdish PYD is barred from talks. Washington has relied on the PYD, particularly its armed wing, the People’s Protection Units (YPG), to oust Isis in north-west Syria and it looks as if the Trump administration has not yet acceded to a Turkish request to abandon the Kurds.\nTurkey and Russia are working together militarily in northern Syria to show they can provide an alternative to the PYD.\nWith the talks formally due to end at lunchtime on Tuesday – early in the morning UK time – any agreement is unlikely to spread beyond the terms for deepening the ceasefire and providing humanitarian access, as well as agreeing on broad principles for a future Syria.\nThe talks may reveal the extent to which tensions between Tehran and Moscow over the future of Syria can be contained. So far, there has been silence, for example, over whether the Iranian-backed Hezbollah should be forced to quit Syria.\nRussia and Iran are both seeking to exploit the military and political victory with commercial and military deals with Assad.\n"

        "text": "\nPriti Patel appeared to be on the verge of leaving the cabinet after her government department confirmed that she held two more meetings with Israeli officials without following protocol and notifying fellow ministers or officials.\nThe international development secretary was already facing demands she should quit the post after failing to come clean with Theresa May over 12 other meetings she has held with senior Israeli figures, including prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. \nSources from the Department for International Development (DfID) confirmed on Tuesday night that Patel held further meetings in September with Israeli government officials without adhering to proper procedures. \nOn 7 September, she met Gilad Erdan, the minister for public security, and was photographed with him on the House of Commons terrace.\nOn 18 September, while in New York, Patel met Yuval Rotem, an official from the Israeli foreign ministry.\nNeither meeting was set up or reported in a way which accorded with proper procedures, sources said.\nThe disclosures add to the pressure upon Patel, who was forced to apologise for holding the 12 undisclosed meetings without government officials present whileon a family holiday in August. \nAs the accusations against her mounted, Patel had already faced censure from Downing Street on Tuesday night, after it emerged she had failed to inform the prime minister of departmental discussions over plans to send aid money to the Israeli army to support humanitarian operations in the Golan Heights.\nShe was also rebuked by No 10 after giving the false impression in an interview with the Guardian that foreign secretary Boris Johnson and the Foreign Office knew about the meetings. \nAt 13 out of a total of 14 meetings with Israeli officials over August and September, she was accompanied by Lord Polak, a lobbyist and a leading member of Conservative Friends of Israel.\nNo 10 on Tuesday said Patel had not informed the prime minister about the “aid to Israel” discussions at a crunch meeting on Monday which was supposed to draw a line under the row. \n\n\n\n\nBoris Johnson and Priti Patel: is this the best British diplomacy has to offer? | Mary Dejevsky\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead, May learned about the proposals from reports in the media, a Downing Street source said.\nConservative MPs failed to rally behind Patel on Tuesday when her conduct was debated in parliament, which will be noted by her critics within the cabinet and the party.\nPatel was not present in the chamber for the meeting, because of a “longstanding commitment” to visit Uganda and Ethiopia with Liam Fox, Downing Street said.\nThe UK does not recognise Israel’s permanent presence in the Golan Heights, which was seized from Syria in the 1967 war, and so providing aid to the Israeli army in this or other occupied territories would be likely to contravene UK policy.\nPatel came under pressure following reports by the BBC on Friday that she had used a holiday in Israel to meet a series of ministers without informing any UK government officials. \nOn the same day, she told the Guardian that Johnson, the foreign secretary, and Foreign Office officials knew of the meetings. \nPatel was hauled into Downing Street for a meeting on Monday, after which No 10 issued a statement saying that a possible breach of the ministerial code had been discussed. \nOn Tuesday morning, it emerged that a conversation had taken place between Patel and Israeli officials about funnelling money via the Israeli army. \nThe prime minister’s spokesman said: “The secretary of state did discuss potential ways to provide medical support for Syrian refugees who are wounded and who cross into the Golan for aid. \n“The Israeli army runs field hospitals there to care for Syrians wounded in the civil war. But there is no change in policy in the area. The UK does not provide any financial support to the Israeli army.”\nMay learned of Patel’s meetings with Israeli politicians on Friday – a day after the PM held a meeting with Netanyahu in Downing Street to mark the centenary of the Balfour declaration.\nPatel has clarified her previous remarks to the Guardian in which she had appeared to suggest that Johnson knew of her schedule beforehand.\nA statement issued by Patel and the DfID said: “This quote may have given the impression that the secretary of state had informed the foreign secretary about the visit in advance. \n“The secretary of state would like to take this opportunity to clarify that this was not the case. The foreign secretary did become aware of the visit, but not in advance of it.”\nPatel also said: “This summer I travelled to Israel, on a family holiday paid for by myself. While away I had the opportunity to meet a number of people and organisations. \n“I am publishing a list of who I met.‎ The Foreign and Commonwealth Office was aware of my visit while it was under way‎.\n“In hindsight, I can see how my enthusiasm to engage in this way could be misread, and how meetings were set up and reported in a way which did not accord with the usual procedures. I am sorry for this and I apologise for it.”\nPatel did not tell British diplomats she was holding the meetings, which is the convention. \nThe Labour party called for an immediate investigation into whether Patel broke the ministerial code of conduct.\nIn Patel’s absence from parliament, only four of her own party’s backbenchers spoke in the debate and expressed concerns and reservations about recent events involving Patel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Israeli forces are seen near a border fence between the Israeli-occupied side of the Golan Heights and Syria. Photograph: Ammar Awad/Reuters\n\n\nCrispin Blunt, a former chair of the Commons foreign affairs committee, said it was important for cabinet ministers to understand both sides of the Israel–Palestinian conflict.\nImplying that Patel did not fully understand the Palestinian perspective, he told Alistair Burt, an experienced minister for the Middle East: “He [Burt] is probably the most equipped of her ministers to take her very gently in hand, and I hope he does.”\nSir Hugo Swire, the former Foreign Office minister, said the public wanted “transparency and accountability” from ministers. Fellow Tory Bob Blackman said it was important to clarify the responsibility of ministers when they went abroad.\nThe Israeli military’s main humanitarian operation in the Golan Heights is Operation Good Neighbour, an effort to aid Syrian civilians.\nThat has seen wounded Syrians being brought across the border – often in the middle of the night – to be treated in Israeli hospitals in the country’s north. Israel is also said to supply a small medical clinic at an undisclosed location just inside Syria.\nThe existence of the Israeli military’s aid efforts was disclosed shortly before Patel’s visit and has been held up by the Israeli government since as an example of its humanitarianism, even towards the citizens of a country with which it does not have friendly relations.\nOn the other side of the equation – and an issue that would have rung alarm bells if diplomats had been present – is the fact that Israel is also player in the Syrian war.\nThe country has launched more than 100 airstrikes during the war, usually against Hezbollah weapons stores inside Syria, and carried out targeted killings.\n"

        "text": "\nIf Donald Trump is going to pursue “the ultimate deal” between Israelis and Palestinians after his brief visits to Saudi Arabia, Israel and the occupied West Bank, the effort looks likely to be based on a 15-year-old peace plan that was barely noticed at the time, has been gathering dust ever since, but remains a rare green shoot in the arid landscape of Middle Eastern diplomacy.\nThat plan was the Arab Peace Initiative (API), unveiled by the then Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah at a summit in Beirut in March 2002. Its launch was soon overshadowed by a far bigger, bloodier drama: a Palestinian suicide bombing that killed 29 elderly Israelis celebrating the Passover holiday. The worst attack of the second intifada triggered Israel’s direct reoccupation of the West Bank, which it had partly turned over to the PLO after the1993 Oslo accords.\n\n\n\n\nThe Middle East 'peace process' was a myth. Donald Trump ended it | Rashid Khalidi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut talk of the API has increased recently. The idea is simple: Arab states will recognise Israel in return for a Palestinian state, its capital in East Jerusalem, in line with the pre-1967 war borders. So far, only Egypt and Jordan have signed peace treaties with Israel, without any linkage to the Palestinian question.\nAnd interest now appears to be reviving – at least in Washington.\nDiplomats report that the Trump administration has been urged to revisit the plan by Egypt, Jordan and Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas, who sounded unusually upbeat after visiting the White House last month. Abbas and the US president met again in Bethlehem on Tuesday, but Trump made no mention either of Israel’s occupation or an independent Palestinian state.\nAlong with the Saudis, the states that are keenest on the API are its neighbours the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain. The entire Arab League reaffirmed support for the initiative in 2007 and repeated that at the last summit in Amman in late March. Syria and Iraq are of course preoccupied with their own grave crises.\nNow the Saudis and their allies are reportedly offering incentives – dangling the prospect of access for Israeli companies, direct communications and over-flight rights in exchange for freezing West Bank settlements and easing the blockade on the Gaza Strip, controlled by Hamas. The ideas were outlined in a paper shared among Gulf countries, according to the Wall Street Journal.\nThese ideas build on significant below-the-radar trade and cooperation between Israel and those states, including discreet intelligence and security links. Diplomats describe a winning combination of Israel’s technical capabilities with Arab human intelligence assets. \nHebrew markings have been seen on Israeli-manufactured ordnance used in the Saudi-led campaign against Houthi rebels in Yemen. The UAE is known to have bought military equipment from Israel.\nIsrael’s announcement of greater freedoms for Palestinians to build in the part of the West Bank dominated by settlements was intended as a confidence-building measure. But that was overshadowed by tensions over hunger-striking Palestinian prisoners. \nPalestinians suspect that what looks like the dilution of the original API is designed to turn it into another “roadmap” for the incremental progress they have come to distrust since Oslo. Abbas’s unpopularity and the debilitating split between his Fatah movement and Hamas are further barriers to progress.\nPalestinians were suspicious of Arab states pursuing their own interests even before Israel’s creation in 1948, and the raison d’etre of the PLO from the mid-1960s was to boost Palestinian independence – not rely on others.\n\n\n\n\nTrump's tough talk on extremism weakened by backing for autocracies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBinyamin Netanyahu likes to boast that Israel gets on well with the Sunni Arab gulf states, which also oppose Iran – the standard bearer of the Shia world – and its Lebanese ally Hezbollah, which are both helping shore up Bashar al-Assad in Syria. Saudi Arabia and Israel both opposed the 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran. Trump’s adoption of the same anti-Iranian narrative on his visit to Riyadh delighted the Israelis. \nNetanyahu has said in the past that he could support the API with “modifications”. The Palestinians have always rejected revisions – and are likely to fear that the Saudis and their Gulf allies may be prepared to settle for less than independence. Still, openly improved relations remain unlikely without significant progress on the Palestinian front.\n “Ending the occupation of our country will pave the way towards implementing the Arab Peace Initiative, and would aid efforts spent on fighting off terrorism and extremism in both the region and the world,” as Abbas put it. \nIt remains to be seen whether, 15 years on, the API can become an active element of the search for Israeli-Palestinian peace.\n"

        "text": "\nOver the past four months, Yemen has been ravaged by a cholera outbreak that the UN has branded the worst in the world. About 7,000 new cases are reported daily – 436,625 have been recorded since the end of April – and already there have been more than 1,915 deaths.\nThe epidemic is one aspect of a broader humanitarian emergency in Yemen. Two-thirds of the population – 18.8 million people – require some form of emergency aid. Food production has collapsed and 4.5 million children and pregnant and lactating women are acutely malnourished. Only 45% of health facilities are functioning, and 14.8 million people lack access to basic healthcare. About the same number require assistance to access safe drinking water and sanitation.\n Cholera, a bacterial infection, is spread by water containing contaminated faeces. It can be easily prevented and easily treated. Cholera first spread from the Ganges delta in 1817, and the resulting pandemics killed tens of millions of people across the world over the 150 years. Modern improvements in water and sanitation infrastructure, and better access to medicines and healthcare, have brought a marked fall in the number of cases. Today, outbreaks occur chiefly in areas where water, sanitation and health systems are inadequate, or where they have been destroyed by natural or manmade disasters. \nUN agencies, respected media outlets – including the BBC and New York Times – and influential medical journals such as the Lancet all argue that two years of conflict have created conditions conducive to a cholera outbreak. This narrative, while true, tells only part of the story. It fails to account for the possibility that one party might be more culpable for the outbreak and the other more affected by it. \n\n\n\n\nYemen: more than one million children at risk of cholera – charity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Yemeni civil war began in September 2014 when Houthi rebels, a group of Zaydi Shia from northern Yemen, took control of the capital, Sana’a, and then, with help from forces loyal to Ali Abdullah Saleh, the former president, overthrew the government the following January. The internationally recognised regime led by President Abed Mansour Hadi set up a parallel government in the southern port of Aden.\nSince March 2015, Saudi Arabia has led a coalition of Sunni Arab states that has attempted to restore the government using airstrikes, an air and naval blockade, and ground troops. The US and UK provide the coalition with logistical support and military equipment. The Saudis have accused Iran of assisting the rebels, but there is limited evidence for this claim and it is denied by the Houthis and Iran.\n At least 10,000 people have been killed and 40,000 injured in the conflict. Both sides stand accused of disregarding the wellbeing of civilians and breaching international law. The rebels have indiscriminately fired artillery into residential areas in government-controlled areas and Saudi Arabia. But as the Saudi-led coalition commands far greater resources, it has been able to cause destruction of a totally different magnitude. \nThe Saudi air force has carried out indiscriminate attacks that have caused the majority of civilian deaths and injuries during the conflict. Airstrikes have targeted civilian infrastructure, including hospitals, farms, schools, water infrastructure, markets and the main port of Hodeida. They complement a Saudi-led naval and air blockade of rebel-controlled areas that has caused shortages of many essential items, including food, fuel and medical supplies. \nIt was not until four weeks after the start of the outbreak that the first plane carrying medical aid was allowed to land in Sana’a. The government no longer pays public employees working in rebel-controlled areas. About 30,000 health workers have not received a salary for almost a year. Sanitation workers and water engineers in Sana’a have been on strike for months, leaving uncollected rubbish on the streets and municipal drains clogged. \n So it is not surprising that rebel-controlled areas are disproportionately affected by the cholera outbreak. About 80% of cases – and deaths – have occurred in governorates controlled by the Houthis. In rebel-controlled areas the attack rate – the number of cases among every 1,000 people – is 17, compared with 10 in government-controlled governorates. The percentage of people with cholera who die is 0.46% in rebel-controlled areas, compared with 0.3% in government-controlled governorates. Thus, a person living in areas under rebel control is 70% more likely to contract cholera and, if they do, 50% more likely to die.\nThese numbers indicate that the outbreak is not simply an inevitable consequence of civil war. It is rather a direct outcome of the Saudi-led coalition’s strategy of targeting civilians and infrastructure in rebel-controlled areas. Criticism of the US and UK governments’ support for the Saudi-led intervention, this has not led to a policy change. In December 2016, the Obama administration banned the sale of precision-guided bombs to Saudi Arabia due to concerns about civilian casualties in Yemen, but in May 2017 the Trump administration agreed to sell $500m such weapons as part of a $110bn deal. The following month a bipartisan effort to stop the sale failed by a few votes in the Senate. Last month in the UK, the high court rejected activists’ claims that ministers were acting illegally by continuing to sell fighter jets and precision-guided bombs to Saudi Arabia when they might be used against civilians in Yemen. In the absence of strong international condemnation of Saudi-led operations, it is hard to foresee a quick end to this public health emergency and the broader humanitarian crisis.\n\nJonathan Kennedy is a lecturer in global health at Queen Mary University of London\n\n"

The militias, made up mainly of Iraqi Shia fighters, had been advancing towards the base throughout the week.\nThe US military said the strikes were aimed at stopping the militia advance and protect fighters it has sponsored throughout the civil war and in the fight against the Islamic State terror group.\n\n\n\n\nIran changes course of road to Mediterranean coast to avoid US forces\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe clash underscores the complexity of the fast-changing battlefields of Syria and Iraq, where a splintered opposition is struggling to hold ground, Isis faces military defeat, and forces allied to the Syrian leader, Bashar al-Assad, are in the ascendant.\nOpposition units in the area continue to be backed by the CIA. They were raised to fight Isis, but have also been positioned as a bulwark against Iran-backed forces that have crossed from Iraq and been instrumental in recent gains made across Syria by the Assad regime.\n“A convoy going down the road didn’t respond to numerous ways for it to be warned off from getting too close to coalition forces in al-Tanf,” said a US defence official in Washington. “Then there was finally a strike against a lead portion of that movement.”\nThe Russian deputy foreign minister, Gennady Gatilov, said on Friday claimed the strike had hit civilians and said it was unacceptable. Syrian state TV reported that military sources said the “brazen attack” had hit a Syrian army position “producing a number of martyrs and causing material damage.”\nThe US defence secretary said that the attack did not mean that the US would be getting more involved Syria’s civil war.\n“We are not increasing our role in the Syrian civil war, but we will defend our troops,” Jim Mattis said. “We will defend ourselves (if) people take aggressive steps against us. And that’s been a going-in policy of ours for a long time.” \nAn opposition leader in al-Tanf said several thousand militiamen were trying to clear anti-Assad forces from the highway, in order to push west towards Mayedin and Deir Azzour, two crucial legs of a land route that Iran is trying to clear towards Damascus.\nThe Guardian reported earlier this week that senior Iraqi and Iranian officials had recently moved the course of the corridor about 140 miles south of its original route because of a strengthened US presence along its original course, through Syria’s Kurdish north-east.\nEarlier on Thursday, Iran’s Fars news agency, which is linked to the country’s powerful Revolutionary Guards Corps, claimed 3,000 members of Hezbollah had been moved to al-Tanf to combat a US plot.\n\nsyria map\n\nThough they remain central to the US-led campaign to defeat Isis in eastern Syria and western Iraq, the forces sponsored by Washington are becoming central to US fears that Iran is finalising a corridor that would secure influence from Tehran to southern Lebanon.\nUS commanders are planning to move forces north from the Jordanian border and south from the Kurdish north towards Deir Azzour, one of the last bastions of Isis in Syria. The planned push, however, is being viewed by Iran as a threat.\n“It didn’t start off about Iran, and it still isn’t totally about them,” said a senior European military official. “But it is becoming that way.\nOn the eve of a visit to Riyadh, where he has vowed to reset relations with Saudi Arabia, Donald Trump has taken a hardline stance against Iran, and the Assad regime, which Tehran heavily backs.\nRiyadh has been pushing for a reset of bilateral relations, which winds back a US pivot towards Iran under the Obama administration in favour of renewed ties between Washington and Riyadh that had been deeply strained during the former president’s second term.\n"

The committee will consider the matter at its next meeting on Tuesday.”\nOne of the MPs on the committee who has complained is Tim Loughton, the Tory MP for East Worthing and Shoreham.\nSources close to the committee said it was normal for the witness in question to be summoned back if members made demands for a recall and cited their grounds.\n\n\n\n\nJeremy Corbyn says he regrets calling Hamas and Hezbollah 'friends'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of several complaints is understood to relate to comments Corbyn made about one of his constituents, Paul Eisen.

He attended Paul Eisen’s events years after everyone knew about his Holocaust denial.”\nAt last week’s hearing, Corbyn told MPs investigating accusations of antisemitism in the Labour party that he regretted once calling members of Hamas and Hezbollah “friends”.\nThe Labour leader said he had used the phrase to describe the militant groups during a meeting in parliament in 2009. “The language I used at that meeting was actually here in parliament and it was about encouraging the meeting to go ahead, encouraging there to be a discussion about the peace process,” he said.\n"

        "text": "\nDonald Trump and the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, have spoken by telephone amid an escalating row over the US president’s sharing of highly sensitive intelligence with Russia, reportedly supplied by Israel.\nThe intelligence breach is the latest drama to affect Trump’s visit to Israel and the Middle East next week, although a spokesman for Netanyahu insisted the 20-minute call – initially not publicised – concerned only details of Trump’s trip.\nThe confirmation of the call came after the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, offered to hand over records of Trump’s talks with the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, to the US Congress. He dismissed the scandal over the intelligence-sharing as “schizophrenia”.\n\n\n\n\nHow Trump's Russia meeting spurred a crisis at the White House\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS officials say Trump shared details about an Islamic State terror threat related to the use of laptop computers on aircraft with Lavrov and Russia’s ambassador to the US, Sergey Kislyak. \nUS media outlets including the New York Times reported on Tuesday that the US ally that supplied the intelligence – on the understanding it not be shared – was Israel.\nTrump on Twitter has strongly defended the sharing of the material, after White House spokesmen denied the story.\nA spokesman in Netanyahu’s office confirmed the phone call had taken place on Tuesday afternoon, but did not say who initiated it.\nIn January, citing unnamed sources, Israel’s Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper reported that US intelligence officials had warned their Israeli counterparts about the risk of sensitive material provided by Israel to the US being leaked from the new administration.\nThe article cited concerns about Trump’s attacks on the US intelligence community as well as fears of alleged Russian intervention in the presidential election. It did not suggest, however, that Trump himself might disclose highly sensitive intelligence material to Russia.\nThe claims about the source of the intelligence on the laptops threat could not come at a more delicate moment. Trump’s visit on Friday, which was already set to be a complicated and sensitive visit diplomatically, has suddenly become even more complex.\nThough there has been no confirmation that Israel was the source, a series of remarks by Israeli officials suggested a desire to draw a line under the affair.\nRon Dermer, Israel’s ambassador to the US, told the New York Times that the countries’ intelligence services would continue to cooperate on counter-terror matters. “Israel has full confidence in our intelligence-sharing relationship with the United States and looks forward to deepening that relationship in the years ahead under President Trump,” Dermer said in a statement.\nIsrael’s defence minister, Avigdor Lieberman, on Wednesday tweeted praise of the “deep, meaningful and unprecedented” security cooperation between the countries, adding: “That is how it has been and that is how it will continue to be.”\nAmnon Sofrin, a former head of the Israeli security service Mossad, said cooperation between the US and Israel was so vast that Trump’s action was unlikely to undermine it. “It may cause small damage, or a local one, but not a disaster,” he said. “None of us in the intelligence community likes this event, but it can be put aside.”\nBehind the scenes and in the media, however, others appeared less certain, raising questions about whether Israel could seek new arrangements for sharing its most sensitive intelligence.\nIn a newspaper column headlined “Dangerous amateurism”, the Israeli intelligence expert Yossi Melman said Trump presumably had passed on the information “not out of malice but simply due to his lack of understanding of the rules of the game”.\n“If he did this with malicious intent, then that is a different story, which borders on treason and espionage,” he wrote in Maariv. “There is no doubt that officials in the US intelligence community are also embarrassed by the president’s amateurism. But at this point, what can they do?”\n\n\n\n\nCould Trump go the way of Nixon? The parallels with Watergate are uncanny | Jonathan Freedland\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor all the reassuring noises coming from Israeli officials, there are real concerns about the perception of a compromised or leaky Trump White House, not least in relation to Russia. Those concerns were amplified on Tuesday by unnamed sources quoted by Yediot suggesting that Israel might need to reassess how it shared intelligence with the US. \n“The problem isn’t the information but the extremely sensitive sources [that were used] to obtain it, some of which took years of investment,” the paper quoted one source as saying. “The Russians aren’t stupid; they’re going to realise where it came from and either they or their allies, all of whom are enemies of Israel, will take appropriate measures.”\nIntelligence ties between the two countries have been strengthening over the last decade and a half, not least in relation to Iran and its clients, including Hezbollah.\nIsrael’s intelligence minister, Yisrael Katz, said he had complete confidence in the US intelligence community despite the latest controversy. “Intelligence cooperation between Israel and the United States regarding the threats posed by Iran and its proxies and Isis and its affiliates will continue and deepen,” he said.\n"

        "text": "\nIran has changed the course of a land corridor that it aims to carve to the Mediterranean coast after officials in Iraq and Tehran feared a growing US military presence in north-eastern Syria had made its original path unviable.\nThe new corridor has been moved 140 miles south to avoid a buildup of US forces that has been assembled to fight Islamic State (Isis). It will now use the Isis-occupied town of Mayadin as a hub in eastern Syria, avoiding the Kurdish north-east, which had earlier been mooted by Iranian leaders as a crucial access route.\nThe changes have been ordered by Maj Gen Qassem Suleimani, commander of the Quds force, and Haidar al-Ameri, the leader of the Popular Mobilisation Front in Iraq, whose Shia-dominated forces have edged closer to the Iraqi town of Ba’aj, a key link in the planned route and where the Isis leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, is known to have been based for much of the past three years.\n\nTehran's route to the sea\n\nThroughout the war with the terror group, and for several years earlier, Iran has been attempting to carve out areas of influence across Iraq and Syria that it and its proxies control. But as the project has taken shape, the evolving Syrian conflict has added new and unpredictable dimensions that have made securing such a corridor increasingly difficult.\nThe US buildup in north-eastern Syria has alarmed officials in Baghdad and Tehran. Senior Iraqi sources have told the Guardian that Iranian leaders believe the stepped-up presence aims to deter Tehran’s ambitions.\n“In response they are doing all they can to make this corridor happen as quickly as they can,” said a senior Iraqi official. “That means finishing off Ba’aj as quickly as they can, then kicking out Isis from Mayadin and Deir Azzour. They want to do this before the Americans get there.”\nBa’aj has become an especially potent prize as the war against Isis in Iraq enters a final phase. As Iraqi police and military units continue to squeeze Mosul, Shia militias who have been stationed for the past seven months in Tel Afar, northwest of Iraq’s second city, began a push over the weekend that has taken them to within three kilometres of Ba’aj’s outskirts.\n\n\n\n\nAmid Syrian chaos, Iran’s game plan emerges: a path to the Mediterranean\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservers said Isis was fighting fiercely to defend the town, which has remained a hotbed of salafi jihadi fighters since the US-led invasion of Iraq 14 years ago. Intelligence officials in the region believe that Baghdadi was in the town for much of March and numerous reports placed him there in February and for much of the battle to retake Mosul.\nThe fall of Ba’aj would be devastating to Isis’s shrinking presence in Iraq, leaving parts of Anbar province as the its last remaining stronghold in the place where it all began for the terror group more than a decade ago.\nAs Isis has rapidly lost ground in Iraq, attention has been diverting to the next – and possibly final – phase of the war, the push to take its last strongholds in Syria, which include Raqqa and Deir Azzour. The makeup of the force that will be sent to take both cities has yet to be finalised, with the US continuing to support Syrian Kurdish groups – to the chagrin of its ally Turkey who is robustly pushing for Arab units that it backs to do the job.\nThe political jostling has made the battlefield in Syria even more complex, forcing Iran to change course on one of its most important long-term goals, just as its progress had seemed assured.\nThe corridor had been marked out in Syria with minimal disruption, crossing from the Iranian border into Jalawla, in Diyala province, across the south of Mosul to Shawqat, then north to Tel Afar. The pivot to the west, bypassing Sinjar, has now pitched Iranian-backed forces into direct combat with Isis, serving the twofold goal of taking an increased role in the war and laying a cornerstone along the new course.\nThe plan has been driven by Shia militias under Iranian direction and has empowered minority communities to secure legs along the way. Kurdish PKK fighters, who had travelled from Turkey, had been central to securing a leg from Mt Sinjar to the Syrian border, but the change in course has taken the corridor to the south.\nIraqi officials say that the newly chosen route is from Deir Azzour to Sukhna to Palmyra, then Damascus, and towards the Lebanese border, where the central goal of emboldening Hezbollah could partially be achieved through demographic swaps. From there, a path to Latakia and the Mediterranean Sea has also been envisaged, giving Iran a supply line that avoids the heavily patrolled Persian Gulf waters.\n"

Then he tried to move the debate on to local authority cuts affecting social care, housing and further education, but struggled to prevent Cameron coming back to antisemitism. He repeatedly called on Corbyn to condemn Hamas and Hezbollah and withdraw previous comments describing the proscribed groups as friends. \nCorbyn attempted to turn the debate towards the Tory campaign for the London mayoralty, claiming that Cameron had smeared the Labour candidate, Sadiq Khan. \nSnap verdict\nA wretched 17 minutes for Corbyn. This is not the first time Cameron has attacked Corbyn’s alleged extremist sympathies at PMQs, but this latest onslaught was particularly timely and pertinent. Corbyn made a reasonable fist of trying to defend himself, dissociating himself from the “friends” remark about Hamas - although not retracting it as bluntly as Cameron proposed - and pointing out, quite rightly, the hypocrisy of the Tory attacks on Suliman Gani. \nThe Cameron broadside was not especially fair, because there is probably no one in parliament who believes that Corbyn actually approves of Hamas rocket attacks on Israelis. The Labour leader, however, has been more sympathetic to groups such as Hamas than MPs in the political mainstream, meaning that Cameron’s comments had enough justification to give them potency. Cameron exploited that to the full, and with brutal effect.\nBest lines\nThis PMQs will be remembered for Cameron pursuing the “friends of Hamas” question.\n\n\n\n\n \n\nHe [Corbyn] referred to Hamas and Hezbollah as his ‘friends’, now he needs to withdraw those remarks.\n\n\nCorbyn’s response? \n\n\n\n\n \n\nI’ve made it very clear Labour is an anti-racism party and no place for antisemitism. \n\n\n\nFor more on PMQs and the day’s politics, read our politics live blog with Andrew Sparrow.\n\n"

Sometimes life has been better, sometimes it is less bad. But the nature of suffering is that when it is happening it is all-consuming.”\nIn the conflict zones of the Middle East, he said, every part of life was dominated by suffering. “That is true whether you are a Christian or not but in this region in addition to the suffering of war, conflict and the tragedies of death and injustice, Christians especially are experiencing persecution, are especially threatened.”\nReferring to visits last week to the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan, which is home to 80,000 Syrians, and to Gaza and the Galilee, he said that, even on a brief visit to “probably the most complicated region of conflicts in the world”, suffering and injustice was evident.\n“Whether it is the utterly disrupted lives of the refugees we met in Zaatari refugee camp last week, or the tears of the Iraqi Christians later that day, seemingly forgotten by the world, one sees endless heartbreak.\n“In Gaza, there is heroism from the doctors at the hospitals, from patients and above all groups of women, but also the ever-looming fears. In Nazareth, across Galilee you hear the voices of anger, or of fear and insecurity, of division and of the impact of almost a century of struggle and conflict, that affect every inhabitant of the region, all of whom tell their stories of fear, of struggle.”\nSuheil Dawani, the Anglican bishop of Jerusalem, who jointly presided over the service of communion, offered prayers for more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners who have been on hunger strike for the past three weeks in Israeli jails.\nSince arriving in the region last Monday, Welby has met King Abdullah of Jordan, visited the Holocaust memorial Yad Vashem and the holy sites of all three monotheistic religions in Jerusalem’s Old City, made a brief trip to Gaza, and visited a Christian school and a kibbutz in the Galilee.\nIn Gaza, he met representatives of the Christian community – mostly Orthodox – whose numbers have dwindled from about 5,000 a decade ago to about 1,000 now. The last Anglican left the Gaza Strip this year, according the archbishop’s aides.\n\n\n\n\nJustin Welby: Christians must unite with Jews to halt rise of antisemitism\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGaza was “genuinely breathtaking, something I’ll never forget”, Welby told the Sunday programme on BBC Radio 4. Aides said he had been struck by the physical devastation of the region, the “collective trauma” of its people and their anxiety about the future. He was also inspired by the resilience of those he met, including medics who have committed to staying in the Strip.\nThe trip – the longest Welby has made since becoming archbishop more than three years ago – will include visits to Bethlehem, where Palestinians have been affected by the separation barrier built by Israel, and Hebron, one of the tensest places in the West Bank, where a few hundred hardline settlers live in the heart of the city. \nThe archbishop will also have talks with the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and is hoping to meet the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas. He will make a speech on reconciliation at the Peres Peace Centre in Jaffa later this week.\nLambeth Palace said it had made a commitment to the British government, in line with official policy, not to meet representatives of Hamas, nor visit Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, which are illegal under international law.\nWelby’s aides said the trip was laying the basis for long-term relationships in the region. His focus was humanitarian and on affirming the Christian community.\n"

In a series of tweets on Tuesday morning, it said aircraft would be relocated from the airbase to their home bases in Russia. \nState television showed footage of soldiers loading an Ilyushin-76 transport plane with equipment to be returned to Russia. An unspecified number of Su-34 fighter jets were among the first group to set off for the long-distance flight back.\n“Personnel are loading equipment, logistics items and inventory into transport aviation aircraft,” the defence ministry wrote, adding that Shoigu had ordered the “main part” of the contingent in Syria to be redeployed.\n\nSyria map\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, the first planes from Latakia landed at an airbase near Voronezh, where they were greeted by families and friends.

It gave renewed impetus to peace talks that began in earnest this week in Geneva, and which are aimed at finding a political solution to a conflict that has lasted five years and killed close to half a million people.\nMoscow’s sudden decision, taken after a meeting between Vladimir Putin and his foreign and defence ministers, highlighted its leverage over the peace negotiations amid the absence of options for western powers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n \nPutin deserves no credit for Syria withdrawal, says Philip Hammond - video\n\n\nWhile state television covered the withdrawal with fanfare, the deputy defence minister, Nikolai Pankov, suggested the bombing campaign was far from over. At a ceremony to mark the withdrawal at the Hmeymim airbase, he said the Russian planes remaining in Syria would continue to carry out missions.\nThe Syrian government sought to downplay the significance of the Russian withdrawal, saying it had been agreed through a mutual understanding between Assad and the Russian president, and that Russia would continue to back the regime’s army.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  A pilot of an Su-34 fighter bomber prepares to leave the Hmeymim air base for the permanent base in Russia.

Kerry told reporters on Tuesday that he would meet Putin and Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov in Moscow. \nSalem al-Meslat, the opposition high negotiations committee’s chief spokesman, said: “We do not know if it is a full withdrawal or a partial withdrawal. If it is a full withdrawal it will make this political process in Geneva much more successful.”\nAsked if the Russians must leave the country altogether, he said that would be preferable, but added “the important thing is they do not target civilians and there are no more military operations in Syria”. \nHe added that Russian troops could remain here and there, including at their existing bases. “We can be their partners if they fight Islamic State and want to fight terrorism. Up until now they have been bombing civilians,” he said. \nHe suggested Putin was now clearly the dominant player in Syria. “The Syrian government delegation has come here to Geneva to waste time. For them they say Assad is a red line, but we set no preconditions. But the decision-maker now in Syria is Russia, not the regime. If they are really putting pressure on the government, then we can make quick progress,” he said. \n“But we want another good brave decision from Putin and that is to be on the side of the Syrian people. We know there have been big efforts from the [United] States and the Europeans that really made Putin take this decision. We have waited a very long time, and we can wait another day to really judge the decision of Putin.”\n"

        "text": "\nOne year ago, the killing of the Russian ambassador to Ankara by a former Turkish policeman would have provoked a rupture in Turkish-Russian relations on the scale that followed the shooting down of a Russian plane by the Turkish jets in November 2015. \nBut ahead of Andrei’s Karlov’s funeral on Thursday, there has been no Russian démarche. Instead the two countries appear drawn closer towards a new embrace, taking Turkey ever further away from the west.\nTurkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, declared for the first time it was obvious that the assassin was a follower of Fetullah Gülen, the cleric living in American exile and allegedly the ringleader of a shadowy movement behind July’s abortive military coup. His followers even implied the CIA may have been involved in Karlov’s murder.\nRussia has sent 18 investigators to Ankara, but Moscow accepted Ankara’s condolences delivered in person by Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, the Turkish foreign minister, when he arrived in Russia on Tuesday for a prearranged meeting with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov.\n\n\n\n\nWhy killing of Russian diplomat may well bring Turkey and Russia closer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reason for the Russian restraint is simple. The president, Vladimir Putin, after the fall of Aleppo, is in the middle of a power play, and the death of a diplomat, however talented and tragic, will not avert him from his chosen course.\nExasperated by what he sees as the American failure to deliver on its promises to isolate the jihadis in the Syrian opposition, Putin plans with Turkey and Iran to prepare his own Syrian peace roadmap. He wants to capitalise on his military victory with a diplomatic triumph. Tuesday’s meeting between the foreign ministers of Turkey Russia and Iran, with its portentous Moscow Declaration, is supposed to be the first stage in the closure of the civil war on Russian terms.\nAt this point at least, the Gulf States, Europe and the US are excluded from the process. Moscow even said “almost every level of dialogue with the US is now frozen. We don’t communicate with one another, or if we do at minimal level”.\nBut Putin may find diplomatic success more elusive than victory on the battlefield. Above all, he depends on the help of Turkey, the most loyal supporters of the Syrian opposition through the past five years. Apart from energy cooperation, the best deal he can offer Erdoğan is a guarantee that the Syrian Kurds on Turkey’s southern border will not be strengthened by any agreement. Hatred of Kurdish independence, even more than hatred of the Gülenists, binds Erdoğan’s supporters together.\nBut Turkey itself is internally divided. There is a strong Eurasianist group around Erdoğan that want to cut their losses with the EU after years of being rebuffed and lack of gratitude for housing millions of Syrian refugees. Others say Europe remains the only viable route to economic modernisation.\nIn Moscow, Çavuşoğlu pointedly said a ceasefire in Syria should not only exclude terrorist groups such as Islamic State and Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, but also Lebanon’s Hezbollah – which fights on the government side. Lavrov implied Hezbollah, like Russia, was in Syria at the government’s invitation.\nAnti-Iranian feeling is at a fever pitch in Erdoğan’s party since it is Tehran’s artillery, as much as Moscow’s air power, that led to the humiliation of Aleppo.\nPossibly unclear himself of his strategy, Putin has said his initiative is designed to complement, and not conflict with, the UN’s existing peace process. But his move has caused unease in the UN; Staffan de Mistura, the UN Syrian special envoy, has announced he will convene rival UN talks on 8 February in Geneva.\nSo far, the UN talks have been plagued by Syrian government objections to the composition of the opposition delegations, the role of the Syrian Kurds and whether it is a requirement that the Syrian government accepts that the president, Bashar al-Assad, will stand down in some way at the end of a transition process.\n\n\n\n\nUS Syria policy: signs of shift as Trump son meets pro-Russia Damascus figure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPutin’s rival peace show may take place in Astana, the capital of Kazakstan. Surrounded by the world’s largest steppe, the futuristic, even bizarre, city is not an entirely random venue to choose since it has played a role in trying to normalise relations between Turkey and Russia, two of its closest allies. \nIt hosted members of the Syrian opposition for talks in May 2015 and has overseen various other international mediation efforts, including 2013 talks between Iran and the P5+1.\nThe May 2015 Syrian talks were initiated by Randa Kassis, the head of the Coalition of Secular and Democratic Syrians.\nMany rebel groups regard Kassis as part of a tame tolerated opposition with little popular support, but she met Donald Trump’s son in Paris recently, suggesting her political star is in the ascendant. However, any attempt to re-stage these talks without key members of the opposition, including those in the Riyadh-convened high negotiations committee are likely to leave them discredited.\nPutin may just be starting to find his role as the great disrupter is a lot easier than that of the great conciliator.\n"

        "text": "\nJust over a month into Syria’s uprising in 2011, the leader of Lebanon’s Druze sect, Walid Jumblatt, travelled to Damascus to visit Syria’s then security tsar, Mohammed Nasif. As well as being the Assad family’s most trusted senior official, he was also the linchpin of Syria’s close ties with Iran and Hezbollah, a man bound more than most to the fate of the regime.\n“He said to me at the time, it’s either us, meaning the Alawites, or them, meaning the Sunnis,” Jumblatt recalled. “I knew which way this was going then. He added, ‘even if it cost us a million dead’.”\nMore than five years later, the toll in the now raging war is well past a quarter of that estimate – international monitors stopped counting last August. The sectarian dimension to the fighting foreshadowed by Nasif is a reality. So is the destruction of much of the country, including the ancient city of Aleppo, which after years of being viewed as the key to Syria’s fate last week slipped from the grasp of the opposition and into the hands of the Syrian regime’s allies, led by Hezbollah.\nThe encirclement of Aleppo is a significant moment in a war that has led to more unrestrained savagery, international repercussions and unlikely alliances than most others in modern times. Another emerged last week, as Hezbollah and Syrian troops were beating back the al-Qaida-aligned Jabhat al-Nusra from farmlands to the north of the city. As that battle raged, the US was drafting a deal with Russia that would create a joint operations centre to coordinate attacks on al-Nusra and Islamic State.\nThe move has created despair among the ranks of the Syrian opposition, which insists that a pact between Moscow and Washington will entrench the Syrian leader, whom Russia and Iran have saved from defeat over the past 12 months. Adding to the alarm of the now diminished rebel ranks is a detente, also signed during the week, between Moscow and Ankara, after a seven-month standoff, as well as the Turkish prime minister’s remarks that Ankara was interested in peace with Damascus.\n“This all means that Assad is no longer at risk,” said a senior official in the western-backed Syrian opposition. “This means that he has won.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  A civil defence member looks for survivors amid rubble of damaged houses after an airstrike on rebel-held Old Aleppo. Photograph: Abdalrhman Ismail/Reuters\n\n\nIn the eyes of the exiled political opposition and rebel fighting groups still in Syria, the political realignments mark a decisive phase in a war that they believe they can no longer win. In recent years, as Bashar al-Assad’s allies have weakened the rebels’ position, a belief endured among opposition military leaders that if they could not win the war, Assad could not either. That view has changed.\n“I’m sitting here in a ruined house in eastern Aleppo,” said Abu Sobhi Jumail, a Syrian opposition fighter who has fought across northern Syria for the past five years. “I have the Russians in the skies, the Syrian air force too, when its planes can fly. I have Isis to my east, Hezbollah to my north and al-Qaida [Jabhat al-Nusra] in between. They abandon us, and tell us to rely on God, and then condemn us when we are forced to seek help [from al-Nusra]. Without them we would all have been killed a year ago. That is not politics. That is life and death.”\nSince Russia launched its large-scale intervention last October, opposition units that had been backed by Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the US have been the prime targets of Moscow’s bombers. Isis has largely been spared, with notable exceptions such as in Palmyra.\nTurkey, too, has mostly left the jihadis alone, concentrating its fight on Syria’s Kurds, whom it views as a subversive extension of Turkish Kurdish groups, which Ankara continues to fight.\nThough remaining a supporter of the Syrian opposition, including Islamic elements such as Ahrar al-Sham, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has focused much of his energies on ensuring that Syria’s Kurds do not seize control of more of the shared border and that their use by the US as proxies in the fight to seize land from Isis in eastern Syria does not amplify the Kurds’ ambitions.\n\n\n\n\nSyrian rebels stunned as Turkey signals normalisation of Damascus relations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“We are doomed in Aleppo,” said Suleiman Aboud, who fled with his family from the rebel east of the city in February. “The next phase of this will be revenge. No one has paid a price for all these abuses. That is what hugging Assad does. This revolution was noble. It may not have been fully democratic, but people are allowed to fight oppression. We have the same rights to safety and freedom as you.”\nAcknowledging the immense suffering across rebel-held parts of the country, Gareth Bayley, the UK’s special envoy for Syria, said: “The situation on the ground in Syria is dire. The UK is deeply concerned by the regime and its allies taking ground and harming civilians in Aleppo and rural Damascus. This is in direct violation of the cessation of hostilities and there is appalling suffering amongst the population.”\nThere is no way out of eastern Aleppo and north to the Turkish border, with the last remaining supply line severed. A blockade that has all but taken hold over the past year is now likely to be enforced, say the few remaining residents of the eastern half of the city.\n“For a long time people have been out of ideas,” said Abu Subhi. “There is no enthusiasm to assist us. They want it all to go away. But you will all be judged for what has happened in Syria. I won’t be alive to witness it, though.”\n"

        "text": "\nUS forces in southern Syria have shot down an Iranian-made armed drone in the second such incident in 12 days, in a further sign that Washington and Tehran’s agendas are colliding along the Syrian-Iraqi desert frontier.\nA US F-15 fighter jet opened fire on the drone in the early afternoon because it was approaching a US outpost near al-Tanf where US advisors were training an anti-Isis local militia, according to the Pentagon spokesman, Capt Jeff Davis.\n“The F15 intercepted the armed UAV [unmanned aerial vehicle] after it was observed advancing on coalition positions. It had ‘dirty wings’, meaning it was loaded with ordnance. The UAV did not make an attempt to divert,” Davis said. \nAl-Tanf is a strategic point near the Syrian, Iraq and Jordanian borders. In a similar incident on 8 June, an Iranian-made drone of the same kind dropped a bomb near US troops at the same training outpost before it was shot down by a US plane.\n\n\n\n\n‘The war after Isis’: has Trump opened the door to conflict with Iran?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“We have said before that demonstrated hostile intent and actions of pro-regime forces towards coalition partner forces in Syria that are conducting legitimate counter-Isis operations in Syria, will not be tolerated,” Davis said. “We do not seek conflict with any party in Syria other than Isis but we will not hesitate to defend ourselves or our partners if necessary.”\nRussia accused the US-led coalition of “complicity with terrorism” by shooting down the drone. “In Syria this type of strike is akin to complicity with terrorism,” deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov told the Interfax news agency.\nAnd as Isis is dislodged from its current strongholds and outside powers compete for control of the vacated territory, the potential for clashes has escalated rapidly. \nTensions are also manifesting themselves in other arenas. On Tuesday, the US reported that a Russian fighter jet came within five feet of a US warplane over the Baltic Sea. US officials said the plane was armed and flying “erratically”. The incident is one of a long string of close encounters as Nato and Russian forces exercise in close proximity.\nUN secretary general Antonio Guterres warned that the recent incidents could be “very dangerous” and lead to an escalation of the war in Syria.\n“I strongly hope that there will be a de-escalation of the situation because these kinds of incidents can be very dangerous in a conflict situation in which there are so many actors and in which the situation is so complex on the ground,” said Guterres.\nIn Syria, Russia announced on Monday that it had suspended a military hotline with US forces and threatened to shoot down coalition planes that flew west of the Euphrates river after the US shot down a Syrian-piloted bomber that flew too close to a US-supported force advancing on the Isis bastion of Raqqa in northern Syria. \nJust before the shooting down of the Syrian bomber, US officials say there was a movement of regime ground troops with tanks and artillery towards two towns near Raqqa that were held by US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). \nAccording to the Pentagon, US warplanes conducted a show of force to try to warn off the advance including strafing runs near regime lines. \nAt that point the Syrian government Su-22 approached and the US aircraft also tried to warn it off by firing flares and carrying out a “head butt manoeuvre”, which entails flying just in front of an aircraft so it is jostled by the wake of the jet engines. \nAccording to the Pentagon account the Su-22 pilot ignored the warning and went into a dive to bomb SDF positions. After that the Syrian jet was shot down by the US warplanes.\nThe US military said there were no signs on Monday that the “deconfliction” channel had been suspended and that they were keen to defuse tensions. On Tuesday, Davis said: “We remain available on our end. I’ll leave it to the Russians to state their level of participation.”\nThe spokesman said that US air operations were continuing, including west of the Euphrates, with some changes to altitude and flight plans in order to “mitigate risk”. On a previous occasion in April when Moscow declared it was closing the deconfliction line as a response to a US missile attack on a Syrian regime air base, the channel was left open and continued to operate normally. \nHowever, Australia announced it was suspending its flights as part of the coalition while there was uncertainty over the deconfliction channel. “As a precautionary measure, Australian defence force strike operations into Syria have temporarily ceased,” the Australian department of defence said on Tuesday.\nAustralia has six fighter jets based in the United Arab Emirates that strike targets in Syria and Iraq.\nThe Iranian drones shot down in the Syrian desert are of the time, Shahed-129, a relatively new addition to Iran’s substantial drone armoury. The Pentagon said it was not aware who was operating the drones shot down over the past two weeks but said that Iran has provided this drone type to the Syrian regime and to the Lebanese Shia militia, Hezbollah. But US officials said that units of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) were known to be in the area.\nGalen Wright, an expert on Iranian armaments who runs a blog on the subject, the Arkenzone, said that the Shahed-129 required a runway to take off and land. “Even if its Syrian, Iraqi or Lebanese personnel pushing the buttons, IRGC personnel or advisors are almost certainly nearby,” Wright said. “Especially given that Shahed-129s are still relatively rare.”\n"

        "text": "\nDonald Trump was the subject of startlingly strong abuse from major sports stars on Saturday, after he criticised NFL players protesting against racial injustice and withdrew an invitation for the NBA-champion Golden State Warriors to visit the White House, breaking a tradition dating back to the Reagan years.\n\n\n\n\nTrump blasts NFL anthem protesters: 'Get that son of a bitch off the field'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers star forward LeBron James called the president a “bum” while the Buffalo Bills running back LeSean McCoy went further, calling Trump an “asshole”. Even NFL commissioner Roger Goodell was critical, saying in a statement: “Divisive comments like [Trump’s] demonstrate an unfortunate lack of respect for the NFL.”\nIn their own statement, the Warriors accepted they would not be going to the White House. But they said they would use their trip to Washington in February – they play the Washington Wizards on the 28th of that month – to “celebrate equality, diversity and inclusion”.\nOn Friday, point guard Steph Curry, the NBA champions’ star player, told reporters he planned to vote no when the players came together to decide whether to visit Trump. The Warriors could “inspire some change” and “send a statement” by snubbing the president, Curry said.\nOn Saturday morning, Trump tweeted: “Going to the White House is considered a great honor for a championship team, Stephen Curry is hesitating, therefore invitation is withdrawn!”\nIn a statement issued later, the Warriors said: “While we intended to meet as a team at the first opportunity we had this morning to collaboratively discuss a potential visit to the White House, we accept that President Trump has made it clear that we are not invited.\n“We believe there is nothing more American than our citizens having the right to express themselves freely on matters important to them. We’re disappointed that we did not have an opportunity during this process to share our views or have open dialogue on issues we felt would be important to raise.\n“In lieu of a visit to the White House, we have decided that we’ll constructively use our trip to the nation’s capital in February to celebrate equality, diversity and inclusion – the values that we embrace as an organization.”\nReports that the Warriors might skip their White House visit first surfaced in June, a day after they defeated the Cavaliers to win a second NBA title in three seasons. It was unclear if the team ever received a formal invitation. There was no immediate White House comment.\nTrump’s tweet came after a rally in Alabama at which he abused NFL players who have chosen to kneel during the national anthem. “Wouldn’t you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, ‘Get that son of a bitch off the field right now. Out! He’s fired. He’s fired!’” the president said.\n\n\nBryan Armen Graham \n(@BryanAGraham)\nTrump's tweet rescinding the Warriors' White House invitation was sent at 8:45am ET. Fox & Friends ran this item roughly 20 minutes earlier. pic.twitter.com/EPYUeMGS2f\n\nSeptember 23, 2017\n\n\nOn Saturday James, a three-time visitor to the Obama White House after winning titles with the Miami Heat and the Cavaliers, launched an extraordinary outburst against Trump.\n“U bum,” James tweeted. “Stephen Curry already said he ain’t going! So therefore ain’t no invite. Going to White House was a great honor until you showed up!”\nMcCoy’s tweet read: “It’s really sad, man … our president is a asshole.”\nThe Houston Rockets point guard Chris Paul, who is president of the NBA players’ union, wrote: “With everything that’s going on in our country, why are YOU focused on who’s kneeling and visiting the White House??? #StayInYoLane.” He added: “And I doubt he’s man enough to call any of those players a son of a bitch to their face.”\nCurry, a two-time NBA most valuable player and the face of the Warriors franchise, had made his feelings clear when asked to respond to comments from the chief executive of Under Armour, his primary sponsor, that Trump was “a real asset” to the country.\n“I agree with that description, if you remove the ‘et’,” Curry said, wryly.\nTrump’s tweet about Curry was sent from his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, approximately 20 minutes after the morning news program Fox & Friends aired an item on the player’s comments. Trump is a well-documented fan of the popular Fox News show; many observers have noticed its role in setting the president’s agenda.\nHe returned to the offensive on Saturday afternoon, writing: “If a player wants the privilege of making millions of dollars in the NFL, or other leagues, he or she should not be allowed to disrespect our Great American Flag (or Country) and should stand for the National Anthem. If not, YOU’RE FIRED. Find something else to do!”\n\n\n\n\nSteph Curry: Golden State Warriors can send statement with White House snub\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral key members of the Warriors set-up have previous spoken out against Trump. Coach Steve Kerr has been among the most vocal critics of the president’s policies, most notably his entry ban on travelers and refugees from six Muslim-majority countries.\nKerr’s father, Malcolm, was killed by two gunmen in 1984 while he was president of the American University of Beirut. Islamic Jihad, a precursor of Hezbollah, claimed responsibility for the murder.\nKerr said: “I would just say that as someone whose family member was a victim of terrorism, having lost my father, if we’re trying to combat terrorism by banishing people from coming to this country, by really going against the principles of what our country is about and creating fear, it’s the wrong way of going about it.\n“If anything, we could be breeding anger and terror. So I’m completely against what’s happening.”\nJohn F Kennedy was the first president to host the NBA champions, when the Boston Celtics visited in January 1963. The visit became an annual occurrence under Ronald Reagan. Golden State visited Barack Obama after winning the title in 2015.\nOn Saturday the national-champion men’s college basketball team, University of North Carolina, said they would not take up their own invitation to visit the White House.\n"

        "text": "\nResidents of east Aleppo have said they hold grave fears for as many as 500 men who were seized by forces loyal to Bashar al-Assad as they overran opposition strongholds in the city.\nThree families contacted by the Guardian said there had been no word from their sons and nephews who had been arrested in the Masakan Hanano district, which fell on Sunday to Iraqi and Lebanese militias within hours of the biggest ground offensive of the war being launched.\n“They took my nephew and my uncle, one was 22 and the other 61,” said one man who fled Masakan Hanano. “I don’t know if I’ll ever see them again.”\nRecaptured neighbourhoods were handed over to the Syrian military, which detained the men across northern Aleppo. After capitulating as the pro-Assad forces arrived, rebel groups were frantically trying to defend what remained of their heartland in east Aleppo, a broken and twisted corner of Syria’s second city that has come to define their plight nationwide.\nThe collapse of rebel defences has led some military observers to predict that the fall of the city could take place before the end of the year, a development that would spell the end of the opposition’s aim of reorienting power away from Assad, the Syrian president.\n\n\n\n\nPro-Assad forces seize third of east Aleppo in rapid advance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRussian bombers, which have pulverised east Aleppo for much of the past year, were again active on Tuesday, targeting what remained of neighbourhoods closer to the Old City, which demarcates the rebel east and the regime-held west.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n \nUN Syria envoy: ‘I can’t tell you how long eastern Aleppo will last’\n\n\nThe United Nations said 16,000 people had fled the offensive in recent days, with thousands more likely to join them. Aid agencies say as many as 250,000 people still live in east Aleppo, which over the past year has become one of the most uninhabitable places on earth.\n“Intensified ground fighting and indiscriminate aerial bombardment over the past few days in eastern Aleppo city has reportedly killed and injured scores of civilians,” said UN humanitarian chief, Stephen O’Brien. “There are no functioning hospitals left, and official food stocks are practically finished.”\nO’Brien said up to 20,000 people had fled the west of the city in recent weeks amid a failed opposition bid to take a corner of Aleppo’s southwest in order to open a supply line to the east.\nWest Aleppo remains comparatively unscathed, four and a half years after rebels from the north Aleppo countryside first stormed into eastern neighbourhoods, ousting Syrian forces in a day-long rout.\nSince then, Aleppo has been one of several centres of gravity in the Syrian civil war, its fortunes central to the fate of the conflict itself. Over the past year, the city’s importance to the regional dynamic has been emphasised by the buildup of large numbers of militias sent to Syria to defend Assad’s battered army, which had been unable to reclaim lost areas under its own steam. Iraqi militias have been critical to the fight, as have Hezbollah forces from Lebanon.\nIraqi analyst Hisham al-Hashimi said as many as 15,000 Shia fighters had been sent from Iraq to Syria, with many deployed around Aleppo.\n\n\n\n\nSyria's war-scarred citadel of Aleppo: a history of cities in 50 buildings, day 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHashimi said the Iraqi fighters have been leading attacks but would not hold areas inside Aleppo. Senior sources connected to Hezbollah confirmed on Monday that the group had played a lead role in the fighting. Up to 1,700 members of the group have been killed fighting in Syria since the start of the nearly six-year war, the sources confirmed.\nForces loyal to Assad continued on Tuesday to maintain a stranglehold around the eastern edge of Aleppo, blocking potential escape routes to the countryside. “To be honest, it is very dangerous to try to leave,” said Hassan Mustafa, a local from the Bustan al-Qasr area. “But our resolve is broken. Their tactics have worked. They have bombed us to our deaths, even while we still breathe.”\nA second local, who refused to be identified said: “It is hard to hold the faith. For so long we have dreamed that people were coming to help us. The reality is no one will. We will die in this place. And humanity will die with us.”\nEuropean diplomats cautioned that the total recapture of the city could lead to retribution against local communities, which had held out since mid-2012. “I’m not just talking about army-aged men,” said one senior official. “This could well lead to something off the scale, involving people from all walks of life. There is no way to police this, and little means to bring the perpetrators to account.”\n"

        "text": "\nDonald Trump, the man who just over a month ago wanted to bar entry of all Syrian refugees into the United States, now wants us to think that he cares deeply about Syrian children. I don’t believe it.\nWhat I do believe is that our president is a bad actor. He was a bad actor on his old television show, and he’s still a bad actor today. And he’s a bad actor in both senses of the term, which is to say his actions are poorly executed and morally questionable. \nAddressing the nation from his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, the president announced that he had authorized “a targeted military strike on the airfield in Syria from where the chemical attack was launched”. Trump was referring to a chemical weapons attack on Tuesday that killed more than 80 people, including dozens of women and children, in the rebel-held town of Khan Sheikhun. The chemical attack had in all likelihood been carried out by the Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad.\nBut what will the US’s military strike – a barrage of at least 59 (offensively named) Tomahawk cruise missiles aimed at a lone airfield – really accomplish? \n\n\n\n\nTrump's response to Syria chemical attack exposes administration’s volatility\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to reports, the missiles targeted only a single Syrian airfield and not Syria’s air defenses. In other words, the attack does not ground Syria’s air force. Nor did the attack strike any of the Russian aircraft currently bombing Syria. In fact, the Russians were alerted of the attack beforehand (who may, in turn, have also alerted the Syrians). The attack does not significantly degrade the military capabilities of Bashar al-Assad.\nSo why attack in the first place? Once again, we’re being told by military officials that their actions are intended “to send a message.” What nonsense this is. Will Bashar al-Assad now cease his murderous actions because he’s just been delivered “a message”? How are we supposed to believe there is any strategy to Trump’s actions anyway? Just last week, Nikki Haley, Trump’s UN ambassador, said of Assad: “Do we think he’s a hindrance? Yes. Are we going to sit there and focus on getting him out? No.”\nWhat the erratic flip-floppery of Trump’s foreign policy really means is that America’s foes can easily manipulate the Trump administration into greater and greater military quagmires. \nHas the administration considered how Lebanon’s Hezbollah will react to the US bombing their close ally Bashar al-Assad? Is the Trump administration prepared to put large numbers of troops on the ground to accomplish its goals? Will it militarily challenge Russia if needed? Or does the US military now only “send messages”?\nThe administration seems to have no vision of what it wants to accomplish or what it can accomplish. Trump ended his announcement of Thursday’s strike with the modest goal of ending “terrorism of all kinds and all types.” Good luck with that. Meanwhile, the heart of the problem is that the United States seems always to have only one solution to war: make more war. \nNone of this exonerates the murderous, thuggish and brutal regime of Bashar al-Assad. The moral and strategic imperatives of our world today demand that the Syrian civil war be brought to a swift and just conclusion. And we must recognize that the end of Syria’s civil war will not be found through military means but through careful deliberation between many different parties. \nBut we are moving farther away from those goals. At its best, Thursday’s reckless and largely ineffective bombing does little but make US lawmakers feel good about themselves. At its worst, it deepens a war which the US has no idea how to end.\n"

        "text": "\nLast week, thousands of people around the world shared the image of five-year-old Omran Daqneesh, who was pulled from the rubble of his home in Aleppo. But fewer shared news that his 10-year-old brother had died from injuries sustained in an airstrike, and even fewer know the names of Ghina and Nagham, my nieces, aged eight and 10, who were shot by a sniper in Madaya, southern Syria, three weeks ago, while drinking water from a spring.\nMadaya is a small town in the Damascus countryside which has become a haven for displaced people during this war. In June last year the Syrian regime, supported by Hezbollah militias, attacked the nearby town of Zabadani, causing a huge wave of people to flee to Madaya. We now have 35,000 displaced people living here, which is around three times the usual number of residents.\nPeople have been trying to grow vegetables to feed the expanded population, but these attempts have been doomed to fail because of an acute water crisis in the region. The fresh water network is completely disrupted because of shelling. This means the only way to obtain fresh water has been to buy very expensive tanks of it or to transport it in plastic containers or gallon-tanks fed by plastic pipes laid from springs in the town. There are three freshwater springs nearby, including the Bukain spring, which the regime and the Hezbollah militias are trying to gain control of – sniper fire is aimed at anyone trying to approach.\n\n\n\n\n \n\nOur town has become a pawn; used by the regime to put pressure on opposition fighters the Free Syrian Army\n\n\nOne of those victims was my niece. According to the doctor’s report, the bullet that hit Ghina shattered her thigh bone. For eight days, our family listened to Ghina’s screams as she suffered without painkillers. She was crying and begging someone to relieve the pain: “I cannot bear the pain … it was not my fault, I was only going to drink water. I want to run and play like other children do and I want to be able to walk again. I don’t want them to cut my leg off. I promise you I will come back to Madaya after the operation. I just want you to get me out of here.”\nOur town has become a pawn; used by the regime to put pressure on opposition fighters the Free Syrian Army in Zabadani. The roads leading to us have been blocked with barriers and barbed wire. Mines were laid in the surrounding agricultural land, preventing food and medical supplies. This has led to a serious food and health crisis. More than 180 people have died from hunger, a shortage of drugs and medical supplies, or have been killed by mines or sniper fire while attempting to flee. The siege has lasted 500 days so far, despite a truce that began in September which has slowed the bombing and allowed some humanitarian aid to get through. However, the blockade is still in place and the aid which has reached us is not nearly enough.\nMadaya today has not received any aid for more than 100 days. Everyone, without exception, is suffering from a shortage of calcium and many are malnourished and anaemic. Recently, more than 45 cases of typhoid were recorded, most of them among women and children, and there are no drugs or antibiotics available.\nWe are lucky enough to have family members in the UK and through their help we managed to launch an international campaign to get Ghina the medical assistance she needed. She was eventually evacuated to Damascus via the Syrian Red Cresent. My family and I were hugely relieved, but tension spread when other families with ill children discovered that Ghina would be evacuated from Madaya, while their loved ones would not. Some in the town said Ghina couldn’t leave alone without other children being evacuated. After intense negotiations with our family and the Hezbollah militias, Ghina was evacuated in the middle of the night. The next day, we tried to keep our good news quiet, but news travels fast in a besieged town.\n\n\n\n\nOmran’s picture must be a turning point in Syria’s war | David Nott\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the following days I was bombarded with requests from other Madaya residents to help their children. Thankfully the humanitarian groups that had helped us continued to put pressure on the regime to evacuate 14 other children in need of urgent care, including 11-year-old Yemaan who had been diagnosed with meningitis. And on Friday the Syrian Red Crescent was able to rescue 36 children from Madaya and rebel-held Foaa and Kefraya.\nBut after Omran, Yemaan and Ghina, what now? The situation in Madaya is only getting worse and many more children will get ill. I’m convinced many will die if the siege is not broken. Winter is coming and many are spending what little they have stocking up on fire wood and dried beans.\nEveryone is worried about the coming months, there are very few supplies and the entire town is relying on more aid to make it in. We urge the UN to keep getting food parcels into us, especially flour, rice and milk for babies. We are all hostages of the regime’s war game, and we just want to be free to go. Don’t forget about us, world. We are living in an open air prison. Don’t forget about Madaya.\n• If you would like to make a donation to help Ghina, visit the Just Giving page.

        "text": "\nFeminist groups in Lebanon have called for protests over the appointment of a man as the country’s first-ever women’s affairs minister.\nThe choice of Jean Ogasapian to run the ministry has sparked widespread disbelief and mockery over what many perceived as an insult to Lebanon’s active women’s rights movement.\nNasri Atallah, a Lebanese writer, described it as “the ultimate act of mansplaining”.\nThe Lebanese government convened this week for the first time since Saad Hariri was sworn in as prime minister. It capped two and a half years of a political vacuum during which the country had no president.\nAmid the political jockeying for seats in the cabinet, which are divided by sectarian loyalties and allegiance to the country’s many warlords-turned-politicians rather than any measure of competence, Ogasapian’s appointment drew strong derision.\nKAFA, a prominent women’s rights organisation, called for protests under the slogan, “No women, no legitimacy”.\n“The government that has been announced is a clear indictment to all the politicians who took part in creating it,” the organisation said in a statement. “It is an insult to all women.”\nLebanon faces many challenges in advancing women’s rights in a nation that has a thin veneer of westernisation but remains deeply patriarchal. Domestic violence is pervasive in the country, and Lebanese women cannot pass on their citizenship to their children if they marry foreigners. \nOnly this month, the parliament began the process of repealing an article in the penal code that allowed the halting of a rape prosecution if the perpetrator married his victim.\nCommentators on social media satirised the appointment of a man in the women’s affairs ministry – a state ministry that will probably have little power to advance women’s rights.\nOne common joke showed Rosie the Riveter, who symbolised American women working in shipyards in a second world war poster campaign, with Ogasapian’s face transposed over Rosie’s.\nRima Njeim, a popular radio host, joked that a male women’s affairs minister could extend maternity leave until a newborn starts school or make all women retake their driving licence tests.\nOthers pointed out that few of the other ministers were suited to their jobs. The tourism minister, for example, has a degree in physics; the minister of culture is a vascular surgeon; the agriculture minister is a lawyer; and the minister of public health holds a degree in engineering.\nLebanon’s new government, led by the son of the assassinated former prime minister Rafik Hariri, faces numerous problems, including decaying infrastructure and power cuts to recurring crises in rubbish collection, caring for a refugee population from Syria that numbers more than a million, and containing the fallout from the war in which Hezbollah, the most powerful military organisation in the country, is fighting for the regime of Bashar al-Assad.\n"

        "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jun/06/qatar-saudi-arabia-west-diplomatic-rift-gulf-states",
        "text": "\nThis week Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt announced that they were again cutting diplomatic ties with Qatar. In a sharp escalation, they have also closed their borders to Qatari aircraft and ships, and the Gulf states have said that Qatari citizens in their countries must leave within two weeks. It is unclear how the standoff will be resolved, but the Saudis and their neighbours are making a clear play for western support, accusing Doha, Qatar’s capital, of backing terror groups including al-Qaida and Islamic State.\nHow did we get here? Before 2011, few in the west knew much about Qatar, the tiny Gulf Arab emirate whose main claim to fame was being the richest per-capita country in the world thanks to an abundance of gas and a paucity of people. But as unrest spread across the Middle East and leaders who had seemed to be immovable monoliths began to topple, an unlikely champion of the revolutionaries on the streets emerged: little Qatar and its Arabic and English-language news service, al-Jazeera.\n\n\n\n\nGulf plunged into diplomatic crisis as countries cut ties with Qatar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot everyone was pleased. The emirate had “too much money”, the Yemeni president Ali Abdullah Saleh said shortly before being deposed, and wanted to be a “big player” in the region. It had fomented a “conspiracy” against the Yemeni government to prove a point, he argued. Foreigners started to take note of the ambitious emirate, and for a while articles on its foreign policy and real estate dealings (Qatar owns billions of pounds’ worth of London property, including the Shard and Harrods) proliferated.\nIt was hard to know what to make of Qatar. Since 2011, Doha has backed rebel groups in Syria and Libya, but also provided troops to help to quell unrest in neighbouring Bahrain. The contradiction was typical of a country that has operated a scattershot, independent and at times maddeningly inconsistent foreign policy, doing its best to punch above its weight wherever it can.\nQatar hosts one of the biggest American military installations in the Middle East, a logistical and operational hub that was crucial to US operations in Iraq – operations of which al-Jazeera was and is a prominent critic. While maintaining relations with Washington, Doha has also managed to build bridges with Iran, develop ties with Hamas and Hezbollah – both designated terrorist organisations by the US – and, for good measure, attempted a thaw in relations with Israel.\nUnsurprisingly, its approach to foreign policy has rubbed some of Qatar’s ostensible allies up the wrong way. “Qatar can’t be an American ally on Monday that sends money to Hamas on Tuesday,” John Kerry, then a US senator, said in 2009. Hacked emails from Hillary Clinton fingered Qatar as a clandestine sponsor of Isis “and other radical Sunni groups in the region”.\nQatar’s Gulf Arab neighbours are even less enamoured of the idiosyncratic course charted by Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, the emir who came to power in a bloodless coup in 1995. Hamad was seen as a maverick who undermined Gulf unity, and meddled in the affairs of neighbouring regimes. Gulf Arab leaders were hopeful that Hamad’s 2013 abdication in favour of his 33-year-old son Tamim would improve matters, particularly after the then Saudi king Abdullah bin Abdulaziz summoned the young emir to Saudi Arabia’s capital Riyadh and demanded pledges of loyalty. But by 2014, the Saudis were so infuriated by Tamim’s continued foreign adventurism that they, along with other regional allies, pulled their diplomats from Doha.\n\n\n\n\nThe Qatar spat exposes Britain’s game of thrones in the Gulf | Paul Mason\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the diplomats eventually returned to their embassies, tensions were never properly resolved – hence the developments this week. The problem for western leaders is that the accusations being made against Qatar bring into focus a wider set of contradictions in their dealings with the Gulf states. Saudi Arabia has also been criticised, for example, for its support of hardline Islamist factions in Syria. A leaked Clinton memo named Riyadh as a sponsor of radical Sunni militias alongside Doha, and this week reports emerged that a UK government report had identified Saudi Arabia as a key sponsor of groups involved in radicalising young Britons.\nMeanwhile the real issue for Riyadh and Abu Dhabi is not so much Doha’s backing for extremist groups as its relationship with the Muslim Brotherhood, its diplomatic ties with Iran and the critical tone al-Jazeera often takes towards other Gulf states. Saudi Arabia sees itself as the regional hegemon, and is sick and tired of Doha’s refusal to toe the line on foreign policy.\nThis leaves western policymakers in a tricky position. Qatar is a major investment destination for UK, US and French energy firms, who have ploughed billions of dollars into gas export facilities which, in turn, play an important role in European and American energy markets.\nDoha is a huge investor in overseas markets, and has committed to spending £5bn in the UK in the run-up to Brexit. The US has 10,000 personnel at the al-Udeid airbase, and would struggle to find a new home for its troops and planes. Not inconsequentially, Doha is also meant to the host the World Cup in 2022. Western powers can’t just pick a side.\nBarack Obama was troubled by the contradictions of the US’s relations with the Gulf states, which he saw as double-dealing “free riders”. His successor, Donald Trump, made a point of travelling to Saudi Arabia on his first foreign trip as part of a reset in relations with the Gulf monarchies – a move that may well have emboldened it to cut ties with Doha. Now, he will have to deal with a diplomatic crisis that threatens to lift the lid on the murkier side of that relationship.\n"

        "text": "\nLabour has accused the Conservatives of creating “fake news” after a Tory attack video that went viral was edited to show Jeremy Corbyn refusing to condemn the IRA, when in fact the Labour leader said: “I condemn all the bombing by the loyalists and the IRA.”\nThe 85-second montage of Corbyn’s quotes has been circulating online for the last week and has been viewed 5.3m times, three times more than any other political campaign video. The Conservatives are also paying Facebook to insert it into people’s news feeds. It is subtitled: “On June 9th, this man could be Prime Minister. We can’t let that happen.”\n\n\n \n\n\nPlay Video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1:25\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Tory attack ad in full\n\n\nIt includes a clip from Corbyn’s appearance on Sky News last month when interviewer Sophy Ridge asked whether he could “condemn unequivocally the IRA”. The Labour leader said: “Look, bombing is wrong, all bombing is wrong, of course I condemn it.” Ridge responded: “But you’re condemning all bombing, can you condemn the IRA without equating it to.” Corbyn said: “No.”\nThe clip was cut off there but the full quote was: “No, I think what you have to say is all bombing has to be condemned and you have to bring about a peace process. Listen, in the 1980s Britain was looking for a military solution, it clearly was never going to work. Ask anyone in the British army at the time … I condemn all the bombing by the loyalists and the IRA.”\n\n\n \n\n\nPlay Video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1:10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Corbyn's response in full\n\n\nThe number of people who have watched the film is similar to a televised party election broadcast audience, but because it is on Facebook it is not regulated by Ofcom, which can only consider complaints about “unjust or unfair treatment of individuals or organisations” in TV party broadcasts.\nAnother Facebook advert paid for by the Conservatives claims Corbyn wants to abolish Britain’s armed forces. This is false. The Labour manifesto pledges to spend 2% of GDP on defence and states: “We will ensure that our armed forces are properly equipped and resourced to respond to wide-ranging security challenges.”\n“The Conservatives are running a hateful campaign based on smears, innuendo and fake news,” said a spokesman for Corbyn. “They do so because they have nothing to offer the British people and their super-rich donors fear Labour’s plan to transform Britain for the many not the few.”\nBut a Conservative spokesman said: “We make no apology for drawing attention to the fact that Jeremy Corbyn has spent a lifetime siding with people who want to do Britain harm, would weaken our defences and make our country less safe. We encourage all readers to watch it and share with their family and friends.”\n\n\n\n\nDoes the Tory attack ad take Corbyn's remarks out of context? | Robert Booth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe video also features Corbyn talking about “friends” in Hamas and Hezbollah and proposing to “close down Nato”. \nAmong the next most-viewed political videos were a Green party clip showing co-leader Caroline Lucas asking the home secretary, Amber Rudd, during Wednesday’s BBC debate: “I genuinely wonder how you sleep at night.” It has been viewed 1.7m times. But Labour had a hit of their own with more than 4 million people watching a clip of ITV’s political editor asking Theresa May “a question from Jeremy Corbyn from Islington” during an interview on Facebook Live.\nThe Guardian asked Conservative HQ if they wanted to highlight false claims in any Labour ads, but it declined.\nThe row came as the main parties cranked up their spending on Facebook advertising with six days to go until the election. Despite the Labour leader’s rising popularity the Conservatives are heavily targeting Corbyn with nine out of 10 of their adverts attacking him, according to an analysis of 889 Facebook ads placed by the three main parties into the feeds of more than 8,000 voters. The data has been gathered by the Who Targets Me project and analysed by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism.\nOne is subtitled: “A leader who supports our armed forces or one who wants to abolish them? The choice is clear: Corbyn and your security is too big a risk.”\nThe false claim may derive from the Conservatives’ attack video which includes a clip of Corbyn saying the words “abolish their army”. It is taken from a speech he gave at a Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament event in 2012 when he said: “Wouldn’t it be wonderful if every politician around the world, instead of taking pride in the size of their armed forces, did what the people of Costa Rica have done and abolished their army and took pride in the fact they don’t have an army?”\n\n\n \n\n\nPlay Video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n0:32\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Corbyn's speech at a CND event in 2012\n\n\nAnother widely circulated Tory ad states: “Putting Jeremy Corbyn in charge of Britain’s Brexit negotiation – and our immigration system – is too big a risk to take.”\nThe strategy appears to reflect the wider approach being taken by Conservative-supporting newspapers of turning fire on Corbyn as polling day approaches.\nLabour, by contrast, is hardly mentioning Theresa May in its social media campaign with only 9% of the 136 different ads seen so far by Who Targets Me referring to the prime minister.\nThe adverts that Labour is promoting hardest are not related to policy, but are urging people to get out and vote. The next most common topics addressed in paid for ads by the party are the NHS and tuition fees. The Conservatives are focusing most on Brexit, the economy and security while the Liberal Democrats are using Facebook ads to talk about Brexit and dementia but also to seek donations.\n"

        "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/13/donald-trump-war-media-despots-freedom-press-crackdown",
        "text": "\nGeorge W Bush’s ‘war on terror’ gave cover to despots around the world – from China, to Turkey and Russia – for violent crackdowns of minority groups seeking greater freedoms. Once these groups were re-cast as ‘terrorists’, it was hard for the West to criticize the states that used heavy-handed tactics against them. Now, Washington DC has invented another ‘war’ that has regimes across the world delighted: the war on the media.\nIn mid-February, Venezuela booted CNN En Espanol from the airwaves, claiming, in a fancier version of Trump’s language, that CNN’s reports “defame and distort the truth.” After the White House in late February barred several news outlets, including the New York Times and Politico, from attending a routine briefing, a government spokesman in Cambodia cited that as an inspiration – and threatened to expel news outlets that don’t follow Phnom Penh’s orders. \nAlso in late February, Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs website launched a page featuring foreign media reporting that it claims contains false information. The Ministry decorated each article – which come from outlets including The New York Times, Al-Jazeera, and the tiny Santa Monica Observer, among others – with the word ‘Fake.’ (“Stop spreading lies and false news,” a Russian foreign ministry spokesperson told a CNN reporter in early March.)\nThese attacks serve two main purposes. They intimidate the media, and strive to ingratiate the country’s government with Trump. \n“To get on the United States’ good side, leaders would use the phrase ‘war on terror,’” said Keith Richburg, a longtime Washington Post foreign correspondent who’s now the director of the Journalism and Media Studies Centre at Hong Kong University. “Now we may see every dictator and autocrat” using the same anti-media language Trump uses, to harass foreign and domestic journalists. “Great opportunity for them to kick out American reporters, and deny them visas,” Richburg said. \n\n\n\n\nWhy Trump wants to disempower institutions that protect the truth | Lawrence Douglas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the weeks following 9/11, Bush made sure to emphasize his respect for Islam, and for Muslims. “Islam is peace,” he said in a speech six days after the attacks. “These terrorists don’t represent peace.” Today, despite potentially huge budget cuts, the State Department will almost certainly continue to support American journalists abroad, and to advocate for press freedom globally. But will Trump stand up for the journalists, operating internationally, who come from outlets critical of him and his White House? That seems unlikely.\nWhile Trump has never specifically discussed whether he would protect journalists abroad, he has long been unsympathetic to Americans caught in international plights. \nIn 1990, when asked about Americans kidnapped in Lebanon during that country’s civil war, Trump told Playboy he blamed the Americans for being in Lebanon – and not the militant group Hezbollah for capturing them. “You feel very bad for him,” Trump added, “but you cannot base foreign policy on his capture.” \nIn December 2015, MSNBC asked Trump how he felt about Russian President Vladmir Putin’s killing of journalists who disagreed with him. In a stunningly wrongheaded display of moral equivalency, Trump replied, “Well I think our country does plenty of killing, too.” \nDuring his campaign, Trump infamously said of John McCain, a decorated Vietnam vet who was tortured in a Vietnamese prison, “I like people who weren’t captured.” Trump’s remarks “show a complete lack of empathy,” David Kaye, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, told me.\nBesides America, Trump’s war on the media will likely have the greatest repercussions in China, a country where foreign media plays an essential role in transmitting accurate information. \nIn their English language commentary, Chinese state media outlets have started adapting Trump’s phrases to denigrate Western journalists’ criticism of China’s human rights abuses. \n\n\n\n\nA top White House official told the media to 'keep its mouth shut'. That's a threat | Francine Prose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Foreign media reports that police tortured a detained lawyer is FAKE NEWS, fabricated to tarnish China’s image,” the newspaper The People’s Daily, a mouthpiece of the Chinese Communist Party, tweeted on March 3. \nThat lawyer, Xie Yang, had earlier said that his interrogators punched him, kicked him, threatened to turn him into an “invalid,” and deprived him of sleep. “I wanted to end their interrogation of me as quickly as I could,” Xie told his lawyers, “even if it meant death.” (The People’s Daily tweet features a macabre photo of man with a shaved head, presumably Xie, smiling behind bars.)\nChinese officials have long been suspicious of American reporters, but fearful of American reprisal. Trump’s war on the media – and America’s shrinking global standing caused by some of Trump’s actions and policies – emboldens Beijing. \n“I now feel more vulnerable,” a longtime American foreign correspondent in Beijing, who asked to speak anonymously, told me, “because the moral gravitas of the Obama administration, and its discourse on press rights, has been wiped out.”\nIn October 2001, Bush told then Secretary Jiang that “the United States and China can accomplish a lot when we work together to fight terrorism.” Trump and China’s Communist Party Secretary Xi Jinping may meet for the first time in April. One hopes they don’t say the same thing about the media.\n"

        "text": "\nIranian leaders have claimed a military victory in Aleppo, with the Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s chief military aide boasting that Syrian president Bashar al-Assad’s forces would have been unable to retake the besieged city without support from Tehran.\n“Aleppo was liberated thanks to a coalition between Iran, Syria, Russia and Lebanon’s Hizbollah,” said Seyed Yahya Rahim-Safavi. “Iran is on one side of this coalition which is approaching victory and this has shown our strength. The new American president should take heed of the powers of Iran.”\n\n\n\n\nAleppo civilians plead for help as airstrikes resume: 'Save us'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIran’s defence minister called his Syrian counterpart to congratulate him and Mohsen Rezaie, a former commander of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards, wrote on Instagram that Iran’s aim was to cleanse “terrorists and takfiris [a term used in Iran for Sunni jihadists]” from Syria and Iraq.\nThe parliamentary speaker, Ali Larijani, also congratulated Assad’s government, saying that US and British policies had hit a dead end in Syria, Iraq, Libya and Yemen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n \n‘Are you incapable of shame?’: Samantha Power criticises Syria, Iran and Russia over Aleppo\n\n\nThe comments underline the key role played by Iranian-backed Shia militias – but they also signalled a new phase in the power struggle for Syria’s second city, the fate of which will largely determine who wins the war. \nTuesday’s Russian-Turkish deal to spare the last of the opposition was brokered with little input from Iran or the Syrian leadership, who had controlled the battle since Russia scaled back its bombardment. \nPro-Assad forces which had cornered the city’s lasted holdouts were startled by the ceasefire agreement, and were determined to transform their momentum into all-out conquest of the rebel-held areas.\nThe militias resumed their offensive before dawn on Wednesday, not long before the first of tens of thousands of trapped civilians were supposed to be evacuated. \nAirstrikes, believed to be Syrian, soon followed, and a hard-won diplomatic reprieve was in peril, as in all previous attempts to broker peace in Aleppo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Pro-government forces patrol Aleppo on Wednesday. Photograph: George Ourfalian/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\nUntil recently, Russian firepower has been decisive. But after the air campaign gave way to a ground offensive earlier this month, Iran’s proxies took the lead, giving them a driving role in what happens next.\nAccording a spokesman for one of the Aleppo factions, the ceasefire was immediately in doubt after Iran imposed conditions the rebels could not meet.\nYasser al-Youssef, of the Noureddine al-Zenki militia said Iran’s demands included the lifting of a rebel siege on Shia villages in Idlib, province, as well as deals on prisoners and missing members of Iranian-backed militias.\n“Iran has prepared to invade our besieged areas and has defied Russia’s agreement,” said al-Youssef. \nIran and the Syrian government do not want to compromise on the battlefield or at the negotiating table, believing that total domination will give them a better hand to shape the aftermath. Russia, on the other hand, sees a benefit in transitioning from bludgeoning superpower to peace-broker.\nThe clash is the first serious divergence between Tehran and Moscow, whose heavyweight interventions have saved Assad but greatly diminished Syria’s sovereignty. But with the endgame in sight, the “win first, settle up later” approach has reached a nadir.\n\n\n\n\nSectarian fighters mass for battle to capture east Aleppo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIran’s role in the Aleppo crisis is set to dominate Thursday’s regular meeting of EU heads of state in Brussels, with leaders of the Syrian opposition calling for economic sanctions to be imposed on Russia and Iran.\nThe EU, increasingly marginal to a crisis being resolved by Russia, Iran and Turkey , is certain to make it clear that it will not supply any cash for economic reconstruction unless there is a negotiated political settlement – and not a military resolution imposed by Iran or the Syrian government.\nIn a letter to EU leaders, Dr Riyad Hijib, the co ordinator of the Syrian High Negotiating Committee (HNC), called for “targeted unilateral sanctions against Russian and Iranian entities and individuals directly enabling war crimes in Syria through the supply of material assistance”.\nThe HNC also called for an urgent review of economic ties with Iran , including commercial airlines used by Iran to send weapons and fighters to Syria.\nMany EU states will be deeply reluctant to re impose sanctions on Iran so soon after lifting them as part of the wider deal on Iran’s nuclear programme. \nBut the renewed emphasis on Iran reflects the key role played by Iranian artillery in the capture of east Aleppo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n \nVoices from Aleppo: the situation is apocalyptic – video report\n\n\nShia militias have also played a decisive role. Raised by Iran’s Revolutionary Guards, the militias have been far more effective than Syrian units. Their numbers had built around east Aleppo since early last year to an estimated force of 6,000-8,000 troops, many of them battle-hardened in Iraq or southern Lebanon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Major General Qassem Suleimani, the leader of the Iranian-backed militias fighting in Syria. Photograph: HO/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\nThe militias report to the Iranian Maj Gen Qassem Suleimani, who was tasked more than a decade ago by the supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, to export the values of the Islamic Revolution into the Arab world. Suleimani’s Quds Force is one of the Guards’ most elite units, attracting ideological cadres who believe in Shia supremacy.\nUnder Suleimani’s control are several Iraqi units, Asa’ib ahl al-Haq, Abu al-Fadhil al-Abbas, and the Nujaba Front, which is affiliated with the Keta’ib Hezbollah militia. All are power players in Iraq’s political-military sphere. Lebanese Hezbollah plays the same role in Beirut and southern Lebanon, where it is interwoven into the political and security apparatus.\n\n\n\n\nThe battle for eastern Aleppo in maps: how rebel territory is shrinking\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHezbollah was the first of the Iranian proxies to join the fight alongside Assad, and has paid a heavy price for doing so. Party loyalists in Beirut say at least 1,600 of its fighters had been killed in Syria before the conquest of east Aleppo.\nShia graveyards in Najaf have similarly been filling up, with several thousand Iraqi fighters known to have been killed in Syria and buried in large dedicated plots bought by the militias over the past three years. \nMost casualties from the Iranian side have been Afghan refugees, recruited on the promise that their families would gain the right to reside in Iran. But an Iranian official said recently that as many as 1,000 Iranians had died in Syria since the conflict began. \nThe blood and treasure expended by Iran has focused on Aleppo and the western suburbs of Damascus, the site of the Zainab shrine – a pilgrimage point for Shia Muslims.\nIran has framed its war effort in sectarian terms, insisting the men it has sent to fight are in Syria to defend the shrine from Sunni extremists. In addresses inside Syria, Akram al-Ka’abi, the leader of the Nujaba Front, has exhorted his followers to seek revenge for battlefield losses to Sunni figures in the founding years of Islam.\nOn Tuesday, President Hassan Rouhani, meeting with the prominent Iraqi cleric Ammar al-Hakim, in Tehran, said his government would spare no efforts in supporting “the oppressed nations of the region, including Iraq and Syria”.\nIn a departure from his hitherto cautious stance on Syria, Rouhani telephoned Assad on Wednesday to “congratulate” him on the “liberation of Aleppo”, Fars news reported. “We see it as our duty to support those trying to force takfiri terrorism out of their territory,” he told his Syrian counterpart. \n \n• This article was amended on 15 December 2016.

        "text": "\nDonald Trump, on his first presidential visit to Israel and the West Bank, has escalated his war of words against Iran, demanding that Tehran immediately stop its financial and military support for “terrorists and militias” and reiterating that it must never be permitted to possess nuclear weapons.\nTrump referred to the Iran issue repeatedly on Monday, expanding on his speech in Saudi Arabia the day before in which he blamed “Iran’s rising ambitions” for violently destabilising the Middle East.\n\n\n\n\nTrump declares 'rare opportunity' for peace as overseas tour stops in Israel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The United States and Israel can declare with one voice that Iran must never be allowed to possess a nuclear weapon – never, ever – and must cease its deadly funding, training and equipping of terrorists and militias, and it must cease immediately,” Trump said in at a meeting in Jerusalem with the Israeli president, Reuven Rivlin.\n Trump added that he had detected, too, “a growing realisation among your Arab neighbours that they have common cause with you in the threat posed by Iran”. He returned to the theme during a joint press appearance with the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, on Monday evening.\nTrump also appeared to inadvertently confirm that Israel was the source of classified intelligence material he shared with Russian officials.\nAt the press event with Netanyahu, Trump insisted that he had “never mentioned the word Israel” during his recent meeting with Russian officials in which he divulged classified information that reportedly came from Israel.\nTrump’s visit to Israel was initially presented as an attempt to make a breakthrough in the moribund peace process between Israelis and Palestinians, but any talk of a deal has been overshadowed by his focus on Iran. \nIn his comments on arrival, Trump said he believed there was “a rare opportunity to bring security and stability and peace” to the Middle East peace process, but throughout the day, Iran seemed to concern him more.\nArriving at Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion airport, Trump flew first by helicopter to a Jerusalem under heavy security, where he became the first sitting US president to visit the Western Wall, Judaism’s most holy site, whose capture by Israeli paratroopers 50 years ago during the six day war is being marked this week.\n Trump, wearing a black kippa, stood for a few moments in silent prayer in the men’s section of what is known in Hebrew as the kotel, with his hand placed on the wall, while his wife Melania and daughter Ivanka prayed in the women’s section.\n Trump and his family were unaccompanied by senior Israeli officials for their private visit to the Western Wall plaza. Trump also made a visit to the church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem’s Old City.\nReturning to the subject of Iran later in the day, in off-the-cuff remarks to Netanyahu, Trump added that the Islamic republic appeared emboldened by the historic nuclear deal with Barack Obama. \n“It was a terrible thing for the United States to enter that deal. Iran will never have a nuclear weapon, that I can tell you.”\nTrump’s repeated focus on Iran prompted a response from the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, who insisted on Monday that stability could not be achieved in the Middle East without Tehran’s help.\n“Who can say regional stability can be restored without Iran? Who can say the region will experience total stability without Iran?” Rouhani added.\nSpeaking at his first press conference since his landslide victory in Friday’s presidential vote, the moderate Iranian cleric dismissed the summit Trump attended at the weekend in Saudi Arabia as a “ceremonial [event] that had no political value and will bear no results”.\n\n\n\n\n'One orb to rule them all': image of Donald Trump and glowing globe perplexes internet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The latest comments follow Trump’s remarks in Riyadh on Sunday. He said: “From Lebanon to Iraq to Yemen, Iran funds, arms and trains terrorists, militias and other extremist groups that spread destruction and chaos across the region.” \n Trump’s analysis – essentially relying on the old saw that the enemy of my enemy is my friend – has not, however, necessary been vindicated by recent history in the region, where Israel and Sunni Arab’s shared enmity for Iran has not equated to a common cause.\nOn the first leg of his trip in Saudi Arabia, Trump lashed out at Iran, accusing it of fuelling “the fires of sectarian conflict and terror” and calling for its international isolation “until the Iranian regime is willing to be a partner for peace”.\nThat refrain echoed the Saudi King Salman’s description of the Iranian government as “the tip of the spear of global terrorism”.\n The focus on Iran as a source of instability comes as Trump has pointedly avoided blaming Sunni states – including Saudi Arabia – for their own role in supporting extremist groups and terrorism. \n The United States brands Iran a “state sponsor of terrorism”. It says Tehran’s support for Syria’s president, Bashar al-Assad, in Syria’s civil war, Houthi rebels in Yemen’s civil war and the Hezbollah Shia political party and militia in Lebanon have helped destabilize the Middle East.\n The emerging approach by the Trump administration marks a sharp break with the policy of Barack Obama, who had sought to engage with Iran.\n Instead, Trump appears to have chosen to pick sides in uncritical alliance against Iran, not least with Saudi Arabia – agreeing $350bn in arms sales over the next decade – and giving explicit support to the Saudi-led campaign against Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen, a campaign that has drawn sharp criticism from human rights groups.\n\n\n\n\nPoliticians and protesters greet Trump in Israel – in pictures\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking on Monday, Rouhani said: “You can’t resolve the issue of terrorism by giving money to super powers. I don’t think people of America would trade the blood they gave in 9/11 in exchange for money raised in arms sales.”\nRouhani also noted the irony of Trump’s remarks, coming, as they do, after an Iranian election that strengthened moderates in the country.\n“Mr Trump visited the region at the time millions of our people went to the polls. He went to a country whose people haven’t even seen ballot boxes and elections don’t have any meaning for them. I hope one day Saudi Arabia also drives its national strength through elections. Power should not pass on through inheritance, but through elections,” he said.\nAzadeh Kian of Sciences Po University in Paris said: “Battle lines are being drawn and it’s worrying, especially when it comes just a day after the election victory of Rouhani, which showed a real dynamic in favour of democratisation and opening in Iranian society.”\n"

        "title": "UN welcomes Syria ceasefire against backdrop of deadlock and dissent",

        "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/31/syria-ceasefire-russia-united-nations-iran-turkey",
        "text": "\nA tentative ceasefire is holding in most parts of Syria as the truce’s main backer, Russia, pushes for a United Nations resolution, which it says would start a political process that could quickly take the steam out of six years of war.\nAs the most destructive year of the conflict drew to a close, Moscow and Ankara were moving frantically to secure the deal, which each side claimed offers the best hope yet of an end to a war that has had few boundaries and no apparent endpoint.\nThe UN security council welcomed the deal and plans for fresh peace talks but the resolution comes against a backdrop of deadlock among members supporting different approaches.\nEven as the bilateral push intensified, opposition groups warned that texts of agreements to be put to the UN this weekend failed to enshrine a key element of their cause – a political transition away from Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad towards a new governing body that would rebuild the country and reshape its body politic.\nThe demand was central to previous US and UN-led initiatives and senior opposition leaders said they would consider the ceasefire deal null and void unless it was honoured. The standoff marks a moment of reckoning for Russia and Turkey which, after earlier pursuing competing visions for postwar Syria, have in the past six months found much common ground and, along with Iran, are rapidly carving out spheres of influence across the once sovereign state.\nTurkey, a backer of mainstream and Islamist groups, has moved away from its earlier insistence that Assad be defeated militarily, but remains adamant that he be removed in a political process. Russia, meanwhile, has hedged, insisting repeatedly to opposition negotiators that it is not wedded to the embattled president, but refusing to commit to a transition.\nThe bilateral push has come when the anti-Assad opposition is at its weakest point in the war. Having been bombed out of Aleppo and steadily abandoned by its regional backers, six of the seven main armed groups have signed on to the peace initiative, after receiving assurances that aid will start to flow to besieged areas if it continues to hold.\n“What could we do?” asked a senior member of Jaysh al-Islam, one of the signatories to the truce. “Our backers [Saudi Arabia] have been nowhere to be seen all year. There’s no one from the Gulf here at all.” Qatar, a prominent backer of the opposition and ally of Turkey, has sharply scaled back its support in the past six months. Diplomatic sources confirmed to the Observer that the reduced backing is partly due to a threat from senior Russian officials. “That happened in around August,” said one senior regional official. “But the other reason they withdrew was they did not want to be associated with a losing cause.”\nWhile things have fallen into line for Russia and Turkey, not all stakeholders in the crisis are satisfied. Iran, which is not a driver of the ceasefire plan, but is a pivotal player in Syria’s short-term future, remains implacably opposed to Assad’s exit. Along with Russia, it has invested blood and treasure in stabilising him and safeguarding the remaining pillars of regime influence. However, now that battlefield wins have effectively ensured Assad cannot lose, very divergent views are emerging about what comes next.\n“The Russian and Iranian views on Syria are diametrically opposed, but the west is not capitalising on that,” said one senior opposition member. “The Iranian model is weak government, geographical areas of complete control by pro-Iranian forces that would guarantee a territorial passage from Iraq to Lebanon. There will be forced migration and cleansing.\n“The Russians on the other hand want a unified Syria, a strong centralised government and their own interests, specifically their military bases and contracts, being secured. The regime is now divided into pro-Russia and pro-Iran elements, with Assad being closer to Iran.”\nThough Assad casts himself as a battle-hardened leader who has prevailed over his foes, officials in Iran, Russia and Turkey are privately scathing about him, his military and the country’s political leadership. Far from presiding over a secure, sovereign state, the Syrian leader has little leverage over what happens next.\nTurkey, which had pushed for a no-fly zone near its border for much of the war, has spent the past five months building a zone of influence inside Syria, within a 60-mile gap between the towns of Irfin and Jarabulus.\nAnkara has used Syrian rebels as shock troops in a push against the Islamic State terror group which retains a presence in the area, and has backed them extensively with its own tanks and elite forces. However, even more pressing for the Turkish leadership than Isis is the presence of Kurdish groups that have used the chaos of war to move into the area and, in doing so, threatened to create a Kurdish presence along Turkey’s entire perimeter with Syria.\nThe Turkish incursion was made with Russian political cover and has served the dual purpose of thwarting Kurdish ambitions and curbing Isis. It has carved out a zone of influence which, in Turkish officials’ minds, limits the ability of Syria’s restive Kurds to link up with the outlawed Kurdish organisation PKK in southeastern Turkey, which Ankara continues to fight.\nIran too has a significant stake. Having led the ground fight for Aleppo, it aims to secure a foothold in eastern Syria, which it will reinforce with demographic shifts of Shias for Sunnis, and build through a corridor under its control, from Tehran to the Mediterranean.\nIran has long viewed Damascus as an essential pillar of its regional ambitions, vis-a-vis Hezbollah, whose presence in southern Lebanon menaces Israel and whose role in Syria helped lead Iran and Assad to the point of victory. However, establishing strategic depth, stretching through Iraq, where Iran also has a whip hand, consolidates a regional influence nearly 38 years in the making.\nAmid the heft of historical ambitions being realised, and the first tangible diplomatic momentum of the war, there is now a sense that things are shifting in Syria. An all but vanquished opposition said it would again pick up arms if its demands were not met at the United Nations security council and if regime helicopters and Hezbollah did not honour the ceasefire. However, the groups have less leverage than when their backing remained robust, and before Russia’s 15-month military blitz.\n“There has been huge pressure to sign [the ceasefire deal],” said a senior member of Ahrar al-Sham. “They gave us 48 hours. There are two documents, one signed by the armed groups and the other by Turkey and Russia as a guarantor. They gave the regime the same set of documents and they returned them with 12 changes, two of them striking, the most important of which was not to include Geneva 1 as a framework for a solution.\n“Geneva 1 dictates that there should be a governing body with full authority of the president, according to the Syrian constitution. It makes the future of the president very clear. By ignoring that you are ignoring the fact that there is a need for a real political transition.”\nRussia in particular has been determined to cast itself as a peacemaker in Syria, after a protracted role as a bludgeoning power. Its diplomatic push has sidelined UN-led negotiations, and the US.\nThree weeks before the inauguration of Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin is close to realising a goal of bringing relative stability to one of the most intractable conflicts of modern times, after helping ensure all other attempts failed. If it works, it will be largely on his terms, giving Russia a stake in the rest of the Middle East for the first time since the end of the Soviet Union.\n"

Is that really true?”\nIt also asked respondents if they believed former Muslims should be punished for leaving Islam.

In the town hall meeting, he said he did “not condone any violence toward Muslims at all”, but added “I won’t back down” and “they need Jesus”.\n“I will not tolerate something like Islam to come into the United States,” Bennett said, calling the religion “a cancer in our nation that needs to be cut out”.\n"

        "text": "\nThe Obama administration is conducting a final review of its Syria policy as it enters its last hundred days, but the rethink is not expected to lead to any radical changes or significant military interventions that could bring US and Russian forces into head-on confrontation.\nThe secretary of state, John Kerry, will travel to Lausanne in Switzerland on Saturday to meet the Russian foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, and their counterparts from the Middle East. Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar are expected to attend. Iran’s participation is in doubt, possibly as a result of the dire state of its relations with Saudi Arabia. \nKerry will brief the UK, French and German governments in London on Sunday, on his way back from Switzerland. \nThe ministers go into the Lausanne meeting with low expectations, diplomats said. The best of the likely outcomes would be a humanitarian pause in the bombing of eastern Aleppo for two or three days to allow some basic humanitarian supplies to reach the embattled rebel-held districts, home to 275,000 people.\n\n\n\n\nGround down by savagery – the agony of Aleppo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe US state department said Kerry would also use the meeting in Lausanne for side meetings on the mounting civilian death toll from the conflict in Yemen, and in particular the Saudi investigation into the coalition bombing of a funeral hall in Sana’a on Saturday. Human Rights Watch said the bomb used in the airstrike, which killed more than 140 people, was made in the US.\nOfficials in Washington are downbeat about the chances that such short truces in Syria, even if agreed, will ever be implemented. One European diplomat said Moscow was in no mood for compromise because it felt a military victory was possible. \n“They don’t care whatever we say about humanitarian law. Obviously they believe that they can win, that the Syrians can win on the ground. They believe Aleppo can fall,” the diplomat said. \nLavrov said he wanted a smaller meeting in Lausanne to allow for “businesslike” discussions among countries with direct influence on the course of the conflict, rather than the much larger forum of the International Syria Support Group. \nKerry’s flight to Switzerland comes only 12 days after he called an end to bilateral talks with Russia on the Syrian conflict. The state department said it never excluded the possibility of meeting Lavrov in multilateral settings but nevertheless Kerry arrives in Lausanne with little leverage, having admitted to Syrian opposition leaders and allied diplomats that he lost the argument inside the administration for a tougher position towards Russia and its Syrian government ally. \nThe administration review began with a meeting of top national security and foreign policy officials on 7 October, after it was clear that US-Russian talks on a ceasefire had entirely collapsed. According to Reuters, a second high-level meeting will be held on Friday. \nMilitary options will be included in the review as a matter of course, but any policy likely to bring US and Russian forces into head-on confrontation will almost certainly be discounted. The administration does not see the outcome of the struggle between the Assad regime and the armed opposition as a matter of direct national security. It ranks protecting the US and its allies from terrorism as its first priority in Syria, followed by the destruction or degradation of Islamic State and al-Qaida networks. Supporting the coming offensives on the Isis hubs of Mosul in Iraq and Raqqa in Syria rank higher on the list of priorities than humanitarian relief and the political transition in Syria, according to officials who have been briefed on the policy review.\nThe most likely outcome of the review is thought to be a new set of sanctions aimed at individuals, ministries and military units deemed to be responsible for the use of bunker-buster and incendiary bombs on residential areas, and the targeting of medical facilities. \nHowever the EU is unlikely to follow the US lead on new sanctions. The renewal of existing sanctions on Russia for its encroachment on Ukraine is due in December and is in doubt at a time when Russian counter-sanctions are affecting some EU member states after an already poor year for agriculture.\n“New sanctions? I really don’t feel it on the European side,” the European diplomat said. \nThe belief in some western capitals that eastern Aleppo will fall by the end of the year was challenged by Charles Lister, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute in Washington. Lister said the densely populated area could only be captured by ground troops and the Syrian army was too demoralised and disorganised to carry out the offensive, leaving Russia, Iran and the Assad regime to rely on Hezbollah and other Shia militias to do the job.\n“Eastern Aleppo is an intensely urban combat environment and if there’s one thing we know about these militia forces, it’s that they have a poor track record of offensive urban warfare operations,” Lister said.\n“The key here is how heavily Hezbollah is involved on the ground, as they’re perhaps the only force that has truly demonstrated a capacity for success in urban fighting. The opposition has also planned a substantial counter-offensive on pro-regime lines south-west of the city, as well as other offensives in Hama and Latakia which would seek to draw regime resources away from any Aleppo operation.”\nLister added: “Ultimately, the opposition’s key strengths are its knowledge of eastern Aleppo’s terrain and the regime’s substantial manpower shortage. There’s little doubt that Aleppo will eventually fall should current events continue as they are, but I wouldn’t bet on the battle for the city being quite as quick or easy as the prevailing narrative currently suggests.”\n"

The Real IRA admitted responsibility for his murder.\nLast month a 74-year-old man from Glasgow, Patrick Gillespie, was charged with withholding information in connection with the MI5 agent’s murder. Gillespie, who has an address in Glasgow’s East End as well as one in Donegal, was granted bail.\nBefore being exposed as a British spy, Donaldson was a prominent figure in Sinn Féin and eventually became head of the party’s administrative team at the Stormont parliament in Belfast. Donaldson was also renowned as a “fixer” for the republican movement’s leadership and was responsible for the removal of candidates the party’s hierarchy were concerned about and their replacement with those who would toe the line.\nAt one time he was also in charge of international relations for Sinn Féin and spent time in the Middle East meeting Palestinian factions and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Throughout that period, Donaldson was also working for British intelligence.\nThe inquest into his death has been delayed at least 19 times, resulting in his family taking legal action against the authorities. It is understood the delays are partly connected to sensitive material that the Garda Síochána possesses, namely the journal that Donaldson was writing after being unmasked as a British agent.\n"

        "text": "\nAhmed Abdu was six when the civil war started in Yemen. Nine years old now, he is small for his age, but once a month he makes a four-mile trek from his mountain village of A’unqba, in the country’s central highlands, to the nearest market where food is available. For half his life, hardship and scarcity have been the norm.\n“Before the war you could eat whatever you wanted – chicken, chocolate bars, anything,” says Ahmed, sitting cross-legged in a terraced maize field. “Now it’s a bit of tea and just a handful of food, one bite only.”\nIn A’unqba they first used electricity via generators in 2010. The nearest tarmac road is less than two miles away, although climbing the precipitous rocky highlands of Taiz governorate, which peak at more than 3,000 metres, driving that distance off-road can take up to an hour.\nThe village has one television set between 45 families, a mosque and a small shop where a can of sardines costs more than double the price in markets on the main road at the bottom of the mountain.\n\n\n\n\nSaudi Arabia still barring aid to Yemen despite pledge to lift siege\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPity the poor civilians in Yemen’s vicious, deadlocked civil war, where the warring sides have been reduced to trying to grind each other into submission through blockades and sieges intended to make everyday life as difficult as possible.\nThe fighting in central Yemen escalated on 22 March 2015 after northern Houthi rebels, supported by military units loyal to the former president of 33 years, Ali Abdullah Saleh, moved into Taiz city, 10 miles north-east of A’unqba.\nFour days later a rapidly formed coalition of nations, led by Saudi Arabia, launched a bombing campaign to push back the Houthi-Saleh forces, who by then controlled Yemen’s four largest cities, including the capital, Sana’a, and had forced the incumbent president, Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi, into exile in the Saudi capital, Riyadh.\nThe battle against the Houthis for control of Taiz by the loosely aligned factions of the “Taiz resistance” has continued ever since. The city epitomises the bogged-down conflict that has divided a nation with the Houthi-Saleh forces using siege tactics to restrict the access of supplies including water, food and medical provisions in one of the most water-scarce areas of the country.\n\n\n Timeline Yemen's civil war  \n\n\n Show \n\n\n Hide  \n\n\n2011 An Arab Spring-inspired uprising forces Yemen’s authoritarian president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, to agree to leave office.\n2012 Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi, previously Saleh’s deputy, takes over as president following an election. He was the only candidate. He struggles to unite the country’s divided political landscape, cope with food insecurity and al-Qaida threats.\n2014 Houthi rebels (who belong to the Zaydi sect of Shia Islam) make advances and begin capturing the north of the country, an area they have historically controlled. In September they enter the capital, Sana’a. Hadi flees to Aden.\n2015 A renewed rebel offensive forces Hadi to flee to Saudi Arabia, which views the Houthis as an Iranian proxy force. It begins bombing what it says are “military targets” associated with the Houthis and forces loyal to Hadi’s predecessor, Saleh. The Saudi air campaign receives backing from a coalition of Sunni Arab states, as well as logistical support from the US, UK and France.\nJune 2016 The Saudi-led coalition is included on a UN blacklist of states and groups that violate children’s rights in conflict, reporting it is responsible for 60% of child deaths and injuries. After Riyadh protests, the UN removes it from the list. Human Rights Watch warns of “political manipulation”. At least 6,200 people have been killed, 2.8 million displaced.\nOctober 2016 An airstrike by the Saudi coalition hits a funeral in Sana’a, killing 140. The UN announces a 72-hour ceasefire, which is allegedly broken by both sides.\n2017 Devastated by two years of fighting, Yemen is described by the UN as the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. Millions facing famine and the threat of cholera. \nNovember 2017 Saudi Arabia imposes a blockade on Yemen’s ports, following the firing of a missile at Riyadh from rebel-held territory in Yemen. Medicines, vaccines and food are prevented from entering the country. The heads of the World Food Programme, Unicef and the World Health Organisation warn “untold thousands of innocent victims, among them many children, will die”.\nRebecca Ratcliffe\n\n\n\n\n\nWas this helpful?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you for your feedback.\n\n\n\n\nThen there is the blockade, imposed by the Saudis in an attempt to crush the Houthi rebels. In peacetime Yemen imported 90% of its food, more than 70% of which usually comes through the Houthi-controlled port of Hodeidah, where the Saudi-led coalition placed heavy restrictions on imports until shutting down access completely on 6 November.\nThe tightening of the blockade, which the Saudi kingdom said was necessary to prevent Iranian weapons from being smuggled in to the rebels, included stopping aid and humanitarian workers from entering the country. Last Thursday, agencies said that aid was still blocked a day after the Saudi coalition stated it would allow humanitarian supplies in.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n \nAhmed Abdu, aged nine. Most of his family are across the frontline and he has been left to care for ageing relatives.  Photograph: Iona Craig\n\n\nAhmed’s village was cut off by the fighting for five months during the first year of the war, when mortar rounds and missiles landed in the terraced fields surrounding his home. Although remote rural areas are able to grow corn and other basic crops during the rainy season, climate change has had an impact on their ability to survive during conflict. In the past, villages would store enough food to last for three or four months in times of emergency. In recent years less rainfall, resulting in reduced harvests, means little if any food is stored for periods of crisis. The wider restrictions on imports imposed by the Saudi coalition have driven up food prices, along with the rapid deprecation of the Yemeni currency since its flotation in August.\n“The price of wheat has gone from 4,000 rial [£11] to 7,300 rial,” said Ahmed as he trudged down the mountain towards the tarmac road. “The bag of sugar was 7,000, now it is 14,000, and the rice was 6,000, now it is 9,000,” he said. “My life has been changed, the Houthis and the food …”, he trails off as if daydreaming about all the things he longs to eat. “Before, I had everything to eat, everything. I was happy, at ease. Now you can’t even have one cake.”\nSchool is more or less permanently out. With teachers’ salaries going unpaid, Ahmed’s school in Taiz has been closed since May. “When they get salaries, they teach,” he said.\nCombined with the lack of government wages – unpaid since August 2015 – it means that families are living on little more than bread and oil. As a result, 70% of the population is in need of humanitarian aid.\nEven before the restrictions on aid made earlier this month, seven million Yemenis were facing famine. Save the Children warned on Friday 24 Novemberof 600 new cases of starving children under the age of five every day as a result of the tightened blockade. On 20 November Famine Early Warning Systems Network, an international body, predicted imminent mass famine across Yemen if key ports remained closed.\nAhmed’s father has been looking for work since 2015, a search that has divided his family. His two brothers, two sisters and both parents now live on the other side of the frontline, over the mountain ridge. Ahmed has stayed in A’unqba to help look after his grandparents and two aunts.\n\n\n\n\nSaudis must lift Yemen blockade or ‘untold’ thousands will die, UN agencies warn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite his baby voice, Ahmed appears older than his years. “When the war started I came here and I didn’t want to return back because of the fighting and the Houthis,” he said. “They harass you for your ID and say to you, ‘What are you doing here? You are Daesh, even if you’re a child,” he added, referring to the derogatory term widely used for Islamic State. “I will return back to my family when the war stops, God willing.”\nNama Ali, 50, lives on the other side of the conflict, in the Houthi-controlled governorate of Al-Raymah. After fleeing the conflict in her home town of Yareem, she now lives in a tent in Takareer with her children and grandchildren. Al-Raymah, just south of the blockaded port of Hodeidah, has been at the epicentre of the highest death rate from a cholera epidemic that has swept the country since April. One million suspected cases are expected by the end of the year. In Takareer the women have no choice but to continue to use the local well, their only water source, which has already infected more the 200 people with cholera.\nOxfam warned on Saturday of a fresh spike in the spread of the disease, with eight million people expected to be without running water within days as fuel supplies run out due to the continuing blockade on northern ports.\n“The punishment of ordinary civilians is never justified. These are real people whose lives are being callously jeopardised in other countries’ war games. Yemen can’t take much more. Unless the blockade is lifted, millions already in crisis will face a fresh catastrophe,” Shane Stevenson, Oxfam’s director in Yemen said in a statement.\nThe primary source of income for families in Takareer used to come from wages sent from abroad. Before the war most of the men from the village worked in construction or herding goats in Saudi Arabia. Forced to return when the Saudi intervention began, now their income comes from felling trees to make charcoal to sell in the local markets, as no one can afford to pay the inflated prices for cooking gas.\n“No salary means no money, means no food,” says Nama, whose lifestyle in a town had not prepared her for the job of fetching and carrying water from a well in the later years of her life. “The children don’t have shoes any more, their feet are like rocks.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  A Yemeni child suffering from diphtheria receives treatment at a hospital in the capital Sanaa. Photograph: Mohammed Huwais/AFP\n\n\nEducation is an issue on this side of the conflict line as well. The lack of schooling for her daughters is one of Nama’s greatest concerns for the future of her children. Their school in Yareem was bombed by a Saudi coalition airstrike. “My daughter was in the sixth grade and now she doesn’t go to school,” she said.\nNama has seen previous conflicts in Yemen, the civil war between north and south in 1994, and the long-running North Yemen civil war that lasted eight years from 1962. But those more isolated conflicts had less of an impact on the wider population. “This time everyone is affected wherever they are, even if it’s a long way from the fighting,” she said. “In this war thousands of women and children have been killed, look what they have done to Yemen,” she said in reference to the Saudi-led coalition’s military intervention.\nInevitably, as the conflict grinds on, the depth of suffering in rural areas is deepening, with more civilians fleeing the cities. At least 66% of the population was estimated by the World Bank to live in rural areas in the year before the war escalated in 2015. The proportion is now much larger. “All the men returned to the village when they lost their jobs and there was fighting in the city. We also have displaced people living here from other areas,” said the sheikh of A’unqba, Ali Hussein.\n\nControl areas in Yemen\n\nWhat began as a power struggle between two presidents: the old, Saleh, and the new, Hadi, has since been usurped by the battle for supremacy between Saudi Arabia and the perceived threat of Iran. The Houthis, who began as a revivalist movement of Zaydi Shias in the 1990s, later became politically allied to Iran. But after fighting six wars with the state under Saleh’s rule between 2004 and 2010 they increasingly became viewed by the Saudis as a proxy for the Tehran government.\nEvidence of that alliance was scarce before the Houthis’ takeover of Sana’a in September 2014. But following their own military intervention, Saudi suspicions have become self-fulfilling. Although the extent of the Iranian involvement or any degree of control over the Houthis remains unclear, the rebel group’s progressive military capabilities and weapon-making skills now bear a startling resemblance to those of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard and Hezbollah. Reports of Iran’s Al-Quds Force, the external arm of the Revolutionary Guard, providing military trainers and expertise to the Houthis, have also surfaced since 2014.\nThe war has been appropriated as a proxy conflict in a much larger regional struggle between Saudi Arabia and Iran, making the prospects for millions of civilians bleak. Aid agencies have declared Yemen the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, compounded by the worst cholera outbreak in modern history. For those in remote rural locations on either side of this divided country, it adds up to a future of more hunger and disease.\n“My wish is for the simple comforts and health for my husband, my children, and my family,” said Nama. “And not to be worn out by this war any more.”\n"

        "text": "\nAs the most intensive air bombardment of the war has rained down on opposition-held east Aleppo this week, an army of some 6,000 pro-government fighters has gathered on its outskirts for what they plan will be an imminent, decisive advance.\nAmong those poised to attack are hundreds of Syrian troops who have eyed the city from distant fixed positions since it was seized by Syrian rebels in mid-2012. \nBut in far greater numbers are an estimated 5,000 foreign fighters who will play a defining role in the battle – and take a lead stake in what emerges from the ruins.\n\n\n\n\nIran covertly recruits Afghan Shias to fight in Syria\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe coming showdown for Aleppo is a culmination of plans made far from the warrooms of Damascus. Shia Islamic fighters have converged on the area from Iraq, Iran, Lebanon and Afghanistan to prepare for a clash that they see as a pre-ordained holy war that will determine the future of the region.\nFor the past four years, Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad and his regime have insisted that his forces were capable of shaping the battle for Aleppo and that the confrontation would be fought along nationalist lines. But with the battle now imminent, the remnants of Assad’s army have been relegated to a supporting role.\nOn social media accounts, and in interviews, leaders of the Shia groups speak in strident sectarian tones about the looming battle, which they bill as part of the same struggle to orientate power in Iraq and Lebanon. \nCommanders gathered near Aleppo include battle-hardened devotees of Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, with close to a decade of experience fighting in Iraq against both US troops and Sunni militants, including the Islamic State (Isis).\nOne of the most prominent of those leaders is Akram al-Kaabi, from the Iraqi militia Harakat Hezbollah al Nujaba, who arrived in Aleppo last weekend. Surrounded by Shia iconography in the town of al-’Ais, near Aleppo, he praised his followers’ willingness to fight far from home and described them as part of an “army of resistance” defending the Shia faith from usurpers.\n“Why are you going to Syria? Because we are in the axis of resistance, and the axis of resistance has many battles all over the world,” al-Kaabi said. “If we had to go to the farthest point of the world, we would go.”\nIn a speech to his fighters which was filmed and shared on social media, al-Kaabi said: “Youth like you are conducting jihad inside Iraq and outside Iraq, your path of jihad is blessed.” \n\n\n\n\nControlled by Iran, the deadly militia recruiting Iraq's men to die in Syria\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvoking centuries-old grievances between Sunnis and Shias, he compared Assad’s opponents in Aleppo to figures from the founding days of Islam who killed the grandson of the Prophet Muhammad at the battle of Karbala in 680 AD. \n“We are facing monsters, the grandsons of Yazid and Muawiyah, and the grandsons of those who carried out the Karbala massacres – and today they want to repeat them.”\nMuawiya and Yazid are still despised by the Shia for undermining attempts by Muhammad’s son-in-law Ali to lead an early Islamic caliphate.\nAll around the edges of Aleppo, yellow and green Shia flags flutter in the wind. Banners commemorating fallen fighters – some from Lebanon’s Hezbollah and more from the Iraqi groups – have been hung from homes and lamp posts.\nThe religious iconography is viewed by the opposition as a claim on the area, which in recent centuries has been home to mostly Sunni communities.\n“Iran has been there a long time,” said Sobhi Zeitun, an opposition fighter who fled Aleppo for Turkey in May. “We could hear them on the radio for a long time. They taunted and mocked. They said they were going to kill us in the name of Ali. This is the face of Bashar, a man who hands over the country to sectarian groups, because he can’t defend it himself.”\nAs the air attacks on Aleppo intensified this week, a senior Iranian general acknowledged that forces he commands had given targets to the Russian air force\n“Many victories, such as the one in Aleppo, could not have been achieved only by air and without the involvement of ground forces,” said Major General Yahya Rahim Safavi, a senior advisor to Iran’s Revolutionary Guards. “The Russian aerial support has been effective but ground forces had been supplying them with information about the location of terrorists.”\n\n\n\n\n'Hell itself': Aleppo reels from alleged use of bunker-buster bombs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTogether with Syrian planes, Russian jets are believed to have dropped more than 1,700 bombs on east Aleppo since the start of the week. Some of the bombs have been bunker busting explosives that Save The Children said have forced the closure of schools that had been moved underground to protect students from near constant attacks.\nThe strikes destroyed two more hospitals on Wednesday, taking to more than 40 the number of hospitals and medical clinics that had been destroyed and damaged in east Aleppo since the Russian intervention to support the Syrian leader one year ago.\nMohammed Sheikh, a resident of East Aleppo, fled the fighting in the city earlier this year. He said that the battle for the city was being fought along sectarian lines but said only one side – the Sunnis – were being labelled as sectarian. “There are hardline people among us [the opposition]. We admit that and we are scared of them. But you should all be scared about what comes next. You should all face what is happening. If this continues to be about one sect fighting the other, this will be a war that will destroy civilisation.”\n• This article was amended on 30 September 2016.

        "text": "\nA doctor specialised in geriatrics tells me he has more and more patients presenting with conditions stemming from anxiety. “It’s somehow worse than the civil war [1975-90],” he says. “In the war, there were clear sides.”\n“In a war you can see the gunman in front of you, and you can hope for a ceasefire,” says Yasser Akkaoui, who has edited the Beirut-based business magazine Executive for the past 15 years. “But today in Lebanon there is a distant hand controlling things, you don’t see the threat. So there’s a fear of the unknown.”\nThis week Hassan Nasrallah, leader of the Lebanese Shia party Hezbollah, decried Saudi Arabia’s “tyrannical, criminal, terrorist and takfiri face” after the Saudis beheaded the leading Shia cleric, Ayatollah Nimr al-Nimr. In response, Ahmad Fatfat, an official in Lebanon’s mainly Sunni Future movement, called Hezbollah “an Iranian militia” that wanted to “take control of Lebanon”.\nIn neighbour Syria, where the death toll has passed 250,000 in four years, the Islamic State (Isis) this week released its latest video, showing the execution of five “spies”. Meanwhile, Israel shelled south Lebanon after Hezbollah bombed Israeli soldiers in a disputed area along the Israel-Lebanon-Syria border. Barely noticed, the UN put the death toll in Yemen at nearly 2,800 after nine months of fighting.\nAnd that’s all just since last Saturday. In Lebanon in 2015, there were suicide car bombs claimed by Isis, popular ‘You Stink’ protests against the government that were crushed by security police, fighting between Islamist and other factions in Palestinian refugee camps, and the sentencing of a former minister for importing explosives to kill politicians and religious figures.\nOrdinary Lebanese are bewildered, their population of around 4.5 million swelled by over 1.5 million Syrian refugees. Mountains of rubbish and electricity cuts are tangible consequences of government corruption and incompetence. There has been a political crisis with the presidency vacant since Michel Sleiman’s term expired in 2014, and paralysis in government for far longer. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  A Lebanese man covers his nose from the smell as he passes by a pile of garbage on a street in Beirut, Lebanon. Photograph: Bilal Hussein/AP\n\n\nAkkaoui believes Lebanon has lacked political direction since Syria withdrew its forces in 2005. “Everything in Lebanon is self-inflicted, we are unable to discern our own interests,” he says. “The Lebanese are left waiting to see who is going to rule the region. Since the development of the ‘Axis of Evil’, there has been a regional civil war, sometimes cold but increasingly hot. Will the axis of Russia-Syria-Iran gain power? We’re waiting to find out.”\nJust across the border in Syria, Russia and Iran are backing president Bashar al-Assad, from the minority Alawi sect, against a collection of rebels who are mainly Sunni and have various degrees of support from the authorities and non-governmental groups in Saudi Arabia and other Arab Gulf countries.\nThere are Lebanese from Hezbollah and Iranian Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) fighting alongside Assad, while on the other side Lebanese Sunnis have joined the rebels. So far, the violence has spilled over only occasionally into Lebanon.\nLebanon has 18 distinct religious sects. Most parties are based on sect and linked to regional interests – the mainly Sunni party Mustaqbal to the Saudis, the Shia parties Amal and Hezbollah to Iran. Lebanon’s Christians, largely hostile before 2005 to Syrian dominance in Lebanon, are now unsure where to turn: some sense Assad and Hezbollah are a better bet than militant Sunnis like Isis, and one Christian leader, Michael Aoun, is openly allied to the ‘party of God’.\n“In terms of the region, Lebanon is unimportant - beyond the fact that the Saudis and Iranians couldn’t resolve enough of their differences to allow the Lebanese to elect a new president,” says Yezid Sayigh, senior associate at the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut. “Lebanon doesn’t figure much, other than the Saudis don’t like Hezbollah, which is strong in Lebanon and that’s exactly why there is an issue about the presidency.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  A crucifix and a statue of the Virgin Mary are seen on the roof of a shop in Jdeideh, northeast of Beirut. Photograph: Patrick Baz/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\nThe problem in waiting for the end of the regional war is that there seems no sign of how and when it will end. Or if anyone will win it; or even if anyone will ‘win’ in Syria. \nBoth Hezbollah and Iran have lost ‘martyrs’ in Syrian – just over 1,000 Lebanese Hezbollahis according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, 400 Iranians according to Irna last June – but why, exactly, are they fighting there? \nOfficially to protect Shia shrines, some of which have been destroyed by Isis. And to advise an allied government fighting ‘terrorists’. \nBut also to maintain a supply route to Hezbollah in Lebanon? As part of an ‘axis of resistance’ to Israel? Even as Hezbollah’s losses in Syria approach the 1,300 killed fighting the Israelis in south Lebanon?\nThe links between Lebanon, Syria and Iran are complex. \nNadia von Maltzahn, research associate at the Orient-Institut in Beirut and author of The Syria-Iran Axis, recently elaborated to me on Tehran’s active, long-term cultural diplomacy in Syria, recalling her visits in 2008-10 to the Iranian cultural centre in Latakia, the Alawi heartland, where the Iranians’ work seem to find more resonance than in mainly Sunni Damascus. She had also noticed, on research trips to Iran, popular scepticism about such outreach.\n\n\n\n\nIran's failed cultural diplomacy in Syria\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“In Iran itself there was very little support for the policy towards the region, especially because ‘so much’ money was being spent on it,” she told me. “In 2009, even before the current situation in Syria, people in Iran were complaining about money being given to Syria and Hezbollah – probably it wasn’t based on real figures, but it was a perception.”\nIs the regional conflict about religion?\nNo, and yes, says Sayigh: “Most of these seemingly religious sectarian rivalries and disputes are about different communities competing for a resource. People identity themselves in certain ways in order to mobilise against each other. A nationalist like Hitler spoke of the ‘German nation’ when most of the ‘Germans’ in Ukraine or Poland were so distant that they were almost unrecognisable and had to be re-Germanised. These are all political agendas.”\nIran’s links with the Assad regime did not begin, as some argue, with a simple marriage of convenience between the supposed secular Baath party and Shia Iran in 1980 against their common enemy Saddam Hussein, who had attacked Iran.\nBack in the 1970s, the Qom-born Lebanese Shia cleric Musa Sadr developed close links with Iranian revolutionaries like Mostafa Chamran and Sadegh Ghotbzadeh, who were in Lebanon working with Palestinian militants. Sadr was also close to Hafez al-Assad, who had taken power in Syria in 1970 and styled himself an Arab nationalist, and Sadr’s religious ruling in 1973 that Alawi were Shia was important in helping legitimise Assad as Syrian president, a post reserved for Muslims. \nThis was not the first attempt to bring the Alawi into the Muslim ‘mainstream’ and neither was it wholly successful. The Alawis’ esoteric beliefs – including the transmigration of souls and the sense of Ali, the prophet Mohammad’s son-in-law, as divine – were one remnant of a vast variation in religion that had characterised the Levant: the valleys and mountains of Lebanon and coastal Syria were for hundreds of years attractive territory under the Ottoman Empire for minority faiths, including the Alawis, Druze, and even Maronite Christians who spoke Syriac rather than Arabic well into the 19th century. Hidden away, it was possible to practise beliefs looked down on by larger groups of Muslims and Christians.\n“Those were times when there wasn’t today’s news flow,” notes Sayigh. But even before Twitter, Facebook and YouTube, identity could adapt and sometimes needed to. “Religion as daily practice is a reinvention of tradition,” says Sayigh. “There are always different political and social agendas, and if you look at any religion you’ll see constant redefinition.”\nIn 1922 the French, ruling Syria under a League of Nations mandate and keen on ‘modernisation’, established Alawi courts under Shia judicial rules. But this did not transform the Alawis into Shia, wrote historian Martin Kramer in 1987:\n\nThis emerges from an anecdote about a visit to Latakia in the 1930s by Lebanon’s preeminent Twelver [ie Shia] divine [cleric], Shaykh Abd al-Husayn Sharaf al-Din of Tyre. To his host, a leading Sunni notable and sayyid of Latakia, he said: ‘I have come first of all to visit you and then to ask about the doctrine of the Alawis among whom you live. I have heard it said that they are ghulat’ [literally ‘exaggerators’ or ‘extremists’, usually applied to people attributing divine characteristics to members of the prophet’s family].\n\n\nIn this curious scene, a Twelver Shi’ite inquired of a Sunni about the beliefs of an Alawi. In fact, the Alawi shaykhs were no more prepared to bare their doctrines to Twelver Shi’ites than to Sunnis. The Alawis had simply chosen to judge themselves, in their own courts, by the principles of Twelver Shi’ite jurisprudence. The religious shaykhs had not decided to submit their beliefs to the scrutiny of Twelver Shi’ites, or to recognize the authority of living Twelver divines.\n\nFast-forward to the 1970s, and heady days of ‘anti-imperialism’ that brought together militant Lebanese, Palestinians and Iranian revolutionaries not just in discussion but for military training. Ali Shariati had developed ‘red Shiism’ as a kind of liberation theology, and knew Chamran and Ghotbzadeh through the Freedom Movement of Iran, founded in 1961. Long before the Revolutionary Guards went to the Bekaa in the early 1980s to train what would become Hezbollah, PLO fighters mixed in Lebanon with Chamran and others who would later lead the IRGC.\nAnd while after 1979 Iran’s Islamic Republic saw itself as neutral in the cold war between the United States and the Soviet Union, the international battle between ‘capitalism’ and ‘communism’ was helping shape the Middle East. Lebanon was caught up from 1958, when US marines came ashore on the beaches just south of Beirut to support the Christian president Camille Chamoun. Lebanon was also embroiled in the struggle of the Palestinians against Israel, especially when the PLO occupied much of south Lebanon and Beirut after their expulsion from Jordan in 1971.\nAmid the ‘anti-imperialism’ of the 1970s, Musa Sadr established Harakat al-Mahroumin (the movement of the deprived), later known as Amal and still one of Lebanon’s two Shia parties. Ayatollah Khomeini adopted the nomenclature in identifying Islam with the mahroumin and the mostazafin (dispossessed) against the mostakberin (oppressors).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Lebanon’s Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah addresses his supporters via a screen in Beirut’s southern suburbs. Photograph: Issam Kobeisi/Reuters\n\n\nBy the time he disappeared in Libya in 1978, a year before Iran’s Revolution, Musa Sadr had helped forge links between Assad and Iran’s revolutionaries, which would work to Iran’s benefit in the 1980s war with Iraq. But these links were already valued by Assad who in 1977, according to Yossi Alpher, then in Mossad, turned down an offer from the Shah’s foreign minister to cut Iran’s relations with Israel in return for Syria rejecting the Iranian opposition.\nKnowing Iran’s revolutionaries in turn helped facilitate Assad’s links with Hezbollah, which emerged in Lebanon around 1983, even if the 80s were messy years when Assad did not approve all of Hezbollah’s actions in taking western hostages or attacking US and French troops. \nBut the era of anti-imperialism was coming to an end, and this too would shape Lebanon.\n“The US Soviet divide went on until the fall of the Berlin wall in 1989, which was the same year as the Taef agreement ended the Lebanese civil war,” says Akkaoui. Brokered by Syria, Saudi Arabia and Iran, Taef opened a period in which Lebanon, even with the Israelis occupying a ‘security zone’ in the south, was at peace and even began to prosper.\nThe drift towards a new polarisation – the ‘regional civil war’ – was uneven. In 2000, all Lebanese factions welcomed Israeli withdrawal from the south and with varying degrees of enthusiasm saluted Hezbollah’s role in helping bring it about.\nSome date the change to the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq, when Iran welcomed the downfall of Saddam Hussein, a change that alarmed Saudi Arabia. Others date it to 2005, when Lebanon’s former Sunni prime minister Rafik Hariri was assassinated, or to 2008, when Hezbollah, which had refused to disarm after the Israeli withdrawal, asserted itself militarily against a Lebanese government led by a Saudi-backed coalition, over its control of security around Beirut’s airport. \nBy May 2011, ‘Arab spring’ protests prompted Saudi intervention in Bahrain to protect a Sunni monarchy facing protests amid a mainly Shia population, and in Syria demonstrations against president Assad’s regime in early 2011 morphed within months into an armed conflict with increasingly sectarian dimensions.\nBy 2015, with the Saudis using air attacks to back ousted Yemeni president Abd Rabbuh Mansour Al Hadi against the Houthis, who are mainly Zaidi Shia, the regional civil war looked distinctly Sunni-Shia. \nBut while events in Lebanon, Saudi Arabia and Iran can reverberate around the region, people may lack real knowledge of each other. Flights between Beirut and Tehran, for example, cater mainly for Shia pilgrims going to Mashhad, and Nadia von Maltzahn’s book is peppered with anecdotes of misunderstanding between Syrians and Iranians.\nInstant reactions may not be informed ones. Saeid Golkar – a lecturer at the Northwestern University, Illinois, who closely monitors Basij social media activity - contrasts a wave of meetings organised by Basijis over the Saudis’ execution of Nimr with a lack of interest, or even contempt, among many other Iranians. \n“People are saying, who cares, he’s an Arab. They’re asking, ‘Why do we need [diplomatic] relations anyway with the Saudis? They’re so backward’.” \nGolkar is uneasy about regional tensions. He believes “hardliners” in Tehran will provoke “distractions” to undermine President Hassan Rouhani in the run-up to elections in late February. “I will not be surprised if there is another crisis in the next month,” he says.\n“Ideologies can plug into all sorts of dynamics and fault lines,” says Sayigh. “In Saudi Arabia and Iran you have had governments and elites that have been actively pursuing a particular discourse, a sectarian ideology. It’s difficult to say it [Shia-Sunni tension] is a long-standing, deep-routed issue when it’s so clear that Saudi and Iranian politicians are deliberately using sectarian discourse. They push it, through education, media, everything.”\nBut playing up external threats for political reasons can have uncertain consequences.\n “None of these conflicts is something natural between the people,” says Golkar. “The creation of political identity along the lines of Sunni and Shia is playing with fire, there will be negative consequence for the countries concerned and for the region as a whole. The fodder for this regional war are the young, the poorly educated, the unemployed. In a way, the hardliners on all sides – Saudi, Iran, the US, Israel – have a subtle alliance, in which they enhance and strengthen each other.”\nThere is little sign of any interruption in the supply of raw material. In October Masood Ahmed, director of the IMF’s Middle East and Central Asia department, said that with oil revenues falling, 10 million additional people would be seeking work in the region’s oil-exporting countries by 2020.\nBack in Lebanon, Yasser Akkaoui, a champion of regulated capitalism, bemoans poor education and the shrinking of the country’s middle class through emigration and lack of social mobility. He despairs at resentment towards the better-off, which he traces back to Musa Sadr’s championing of the mahroumin (deprived).\n “Showing wealth shouldn’t be a crime,” he says. “Yet if you display wealth in Lebanon you attract the interest of the state and the envy, or the anger, of the people. Our politicians show no commitment to change this by fostering a middle class and encouraging education – the only two means to develop our country.”\nAnd just like Lebanon, warns Akkaoui, Saudi Arabia has its own uneducated, unemployed mass all too willing to follow populist, sectarian leaders: “If the house of Saud falls, it would be 20 times worse than Syria. Any weakening of Al-Saud means civil war, and if you think Daesh are bad, just wait.” \n\nThis article was amended to reflect that the PLO occupied much of south Lebanon and Beirut after their expulsion from Jordan in 1971, not 1970.\n\nThe Tehran Bureau is an independent media organisation, hosted by the Guardian.

        "text": "\nWhen underdogs become overdogs, everything changes. They are the masters now, however much they try to pretend otherwise. Their power to change and ruin lives demands relentless and unforgiving scrutiny.\nThe hangover from the long age of globalisation has hidden the existence of a new elite, let alone the need to hold it to account. The neoliberal order began from the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, perhaps earlier with the elections of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan in 1979/1980. You have to be in your 50s to remember another time. It ended with the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008. Its death was disguised because no new system stepped forward to replace it.\nNow its successor is shambling into view, like a figure from a bad dream you hoped you had forgotten. It is nationalism. The often demagogic and always deceitful nationalism you saw in the Brexit campaign and see now in the actions and policies of Donald Trump, Marine Le Pen and Vladimir Putin. Even the Syriza movement, held up by many as a respectable alternative to the old status quo, was powered as much by a grotesque but authentically nationalist Germanophobia as a socialist programme.\nDemagogic nationalism has to be fought. Not only because the promises it makes to its gullible supporters are plainly false, but for a reason many are still struggling to comprehend. Just because the old order left whole classes behind, and promoted inequalities of wealth that offended every moral person, does not mean the alternative will be better. Indeed, we already have evidence enough that the alternative will be worse.\n\n\n\n\nExtremism thrives because of cowardly collaborators | Nick Cohen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry arguing that and you are hit with insults that have been repeated so often they have become cliches. Don’t be elitist. Don’t patronise. Don’t punch down. At best, they reflect a worthy desire to listen to and sympathise with those globalisation left behind. As before in history, however, the long period of stasis also brought a gormless ennui. The desire to welcome challenges to “the establishment”, however repellent, led the BBC to build up George Galloway and Nigel Farage and US cable television to give Trump tens of millions of dollars worth of free publicity. Both thought anything was better than the same old “boring snoring” politicians. Both thought wrong.\nYou see the result when you make the argument that Brexit was an act of gross folly that it will take Britain and Europe years to recover from. You are at once denounced as a metropolitan liberal elitist who treats ordinary people as fools. I agree one must accept that the collapse of European social democracy was caused in part by the failure of narrow, middle-class liberals to understand their fellow citizens. Technocrats thought the fact there was no evidence worth mentioning that immigrants steal jobs or depress wages meant opposition to immigration could be dismissed as irrational prejudice. They did not grasp that most of us, maybe all of us at some point in our lives, value the familiar and the local. New cultures that native Europeans did not understand, and new people whose mannerisms and expressions they could not read, unnerved them.\nMeanwhile, the authoritarianism, which has turned left-liberalism into a movement for sneaks and prudes, was always going to play into the hands of the right. Free citizens have stopped listening to those who respond to the challenge of argument by screaming for the police to arrest the politically incorrect or for universities to ban speakers who depart from leftish orthodoxy.\nThere are good reasons for liberal guilt. There is much to be guilty about, after all. But guilt about “liberal” elitism make no sense. We do not have a liberal elite now. We have a bragging, nationalist and proudly ignorant elite. The “hard Brexit” they are driving us towards will hurt the very workers who voted Leave. With Labour in the hands of the far left, it has, shamefully, fallen to the lone voice of George Osborne to warn that the nationalist elite is about to threaten the jobs and living standards of the very “hard-working” people who so naively believed its promises.\nWhat applies at home applies abroad. The collapse of communism left America as the world’s sole superpower. Even if its foreign policy was consistently benign, resentment of its dominance would have been inevitable. As it was, American power was far from being consistently benign and in the decades since 1989 anyone who questioned it was treated with the indulgence we always grant to Davids who take on a Goliath.\n\n\n\n\nWhy would the EU appease the deluded Brexiters? | Nick Cohen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut see where American power stands today. Russia, Assad, Iran and Hezbollah break the Syrian ceasefire. They bomb aid convoys and turn Aleppo into a 21th-century Dresden. Barack Obama and John Kerry do not look like imperious masters of a unipolar world now. They look like what they are: impotent and humiliated has-beens. Russia can do what it wishes in the Middle East. However loudly America complains it has no option but to tag along. For years, some of us have been writing against the immorality of politicians and intellectuals who excused Slobodan Milošević, Islamo-fascism, Saddam Hussein, the Iranian theocracy and the Russian kleptocracy. You get a measure of how deep the rot has spread when you notice that Trump, and the leaders of Ukip and the Front National are Putin admirers. You realise the scale of the corruption on the left when you find the leader of the British Labour party has worked as a paid propagandist for Iranian state television, defended Milošević, Hamas and Hezbollah – and, not to be left out, Putin too. The moral disgust at their collaborations should never fade. But in our new age, moral arguments have a practical urgency. The destruction of Syria is pushing refugees into Europe, whose presence fuels support for the far-right parties Putin sponsors.\nDenunciations of American power, like denunciations of “neoliberalism” and “liberal elite”, are worse than simplistic now. Like the twitching of a corpse, they are exhausted responses from a world that has gone. They still have propaganda value, no doubt about it. But in the world as it is rather than was, it is Brexiters who are pushing with a doctrinaire determination to leave Britain poorer and meaner than they found it; the extreme left and right that support the regimes that threaten us; and Russian rather than American imperialism that is throwing Europe into chaos.\nLiberal technocrats who “treat ordinary people as fools” neither receive nor deserve a hearing. But show “ordinary people” that their supposed champions have taken them for fools and you have a chance of breaking through. Then, maybe, they will listen.\n"

        "text": "\nCOMETH THE DOUR, COMETH THE VAN\nWho’s laughing at Manchester United now? Absolutely no one, that’s who. But that’s got nothing to do with Louis van Gaal silencing the haters and everything to do with his football being the equivalent of a tranquilliser dart or Kristen Stewart. Things that are currently rated as more fun than viewing United include watching paint dry, old episodes of Fun House, listening to someone else recite their gym regime, cardboard box factories, the Steve Jobs film, reading The Fiver, a car alarm going off in the middle of the night and that song that gets on everybody’s nerves, you know the one, that song that gets on everybody’s nerves, the song about getting on everybody’s nerves, with its lyrics about being a song that gets on people’s nerves.\nStill, at least that song that gets on everybody’s nerves is something to engage with, whereas United’s football merely invokes a sense of ennui and beige. It’s quite impressive in a way, given how much money has been spent on making United this boring, like winning the lottery and spending the dosh on a lifetime’s supply of boiled meat. Yet Saturday’s draw with West Ham was United’s 427th goalless stalemate of the season, although rumours that Van Gaal amused himself by making his players fill out their tax returns during the second half cannot be confirmed, as everyone inside Old Trafford was asleep. All hail The Process!\nA few miles down the road, Jürgen Klopp is making Liverpool exciting to watch again and that’s got Professor Ferg in a flap. “The one thing United don’t want is Liverpool to get above us,” Professor Ferg roiled, sewing some elbow patches on to his blazer. “He’s a fantastic personality, with those big white teeth always showing.” However, United aren’t bothered by Liverpool’s Klopp resurgence, because their suits are too busy thinking about how they’re going to stay awake in upcoming contract talks with Van Gaal, whose current deal runs out in 2017. From what The Fiver can make out in between yawns, it sounds like United would not be averse to extending Van Gaal’s stay. And why not? Pep Guardiola might be available at the end of the season, but it would be United’s pleasure to stand by, do the neighbourly thing and let him go to Manchester City. They’d be more than happy to do so. Delighted. Ecstatic.

        "text": "\nSteve Kerr has joined the chorus of voices in the NBA that have attacked Donald Trump’s ban on travellers and refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries.\nOn Sunday, the Golden State Warriors coach said the president’s executive order had personal resonance. “I would just say that as someone whose family member was a victim of terrorism, having lost my father, if we’re trying to combat terrorism by banishing people from coming to this country, by really going against the principles of what our country is about and creating fear, it’s the wrong way of going about it,” said Kerr whose father, Malcolm, was killed by two gunmen in 1984 while he was president of the American University of Beirut. Islamic Jihad, a precursor of Hezbollah, later claimed responsibility for the murder. “If anything, we could be breeding anger and terror. So I’m completely against what’s happening.”\n\n\n\n\nUSMNT captain Bradley attacks Trump as sports world rounds on travel ban\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump’s policy has led to stories of families being separated, while critics of the ban – including Republican senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham – say it could play into the hands of groups such as Isis. \n“I think [the policy] is shocking. It’s a horrible idea,” Kerr said. “I feel for all the people that are affected. Families are being torn apart, and I worry in the big picture what this means to the security of the world. It’s going about it completely opposite. You want to solve terror, you want to solve crime, this is not the way to do it.”\nThe San Antonio Spurs coach, Gregg Popovich, also spoke about the ban on Sunday. “As you already know, I have lots of thoughts about what we’ve done to ourselves as a country and what we’ve allowed to happen,” Popovich told reporters. “But we’ll see where this goes. Obviously the rollout today was Keystone Kops-like by any measure with objectivity. Whether you want to say it’s good or bad is irrelevant. But it was Keystone Kops, and that’s scary.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The plaque at the base of the Statue of Liberty reads: \"Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, the wretched refuse of your teeming shore.

        "text": "\nLast week, almost 3,000 scientists and policymakers from 120 countries gathered on the shores of the Dead Sea in Jordan for the 2017 World Science Forum. It was a landmark moment for Jordanian science, and a tribute to the vision of Princess Sumaya bint El Hassan, president of Jordan’s Royal Scientific Society, who is in the vanguard of a new generation of leaders championing science and innovation in the region. Jordan is also home to the Middle East’s first advanced light source facility – the Synchrotron-Light for Experimental Science and Applications, or Sesame – which was inaugurated earlier this year as a shared resource for researchers from Cyprus, Egypt, Iran, Israel, Jordan, Pakistan, the Palestinian Authority and Turkey.\nIn its final declaration, the World Science Forum called for more scientific cooperation to promote peace and address regional challenges. But the meeting also provided an opportunity to take stock of the state of science across the Middle East and wider Islamic world. And while the symbolism of the Sesame project was rightly celebrated, there was little of the outright optimism that characterised these debates ten or fifteen years ago.\nIn the early 2000s, several member states of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) embarked on a concerted drive to improve their science and innovation performance: primarily the oil and gas-rich Gulf economies, but also Egypt, Malaysia, Pakistan and Turkey. This gave rise to expectations of an overall strengthening of science and innovation across the Islamic world.\nTo complement efforts at a national level, in 2003, the OIC adopted a new policy framework – Vision 1441 – for the contribution of science and innovation to economic and social progress across its fifty-seven member states. The year 1441 in the Islamic (Hijri) calendar equates to 2020 in the Gregorian calendar, and Vision 1441 includes several targets for OIC countries by this date: to produce 14% of the world’s scientific output; to train 1441 scientists or engineers per million of population; and to invest at least 1.4% of GDP in research and development (R&D).\nCombined with the opening of new universities and marked increases in R&D spending in several OIC countries, Vision 1441 generated a sense of optimism among science and innovation policymakers, which was well captured by a 2006 special issue of the journal Nature on Islam and Science.\nShortly afterwards, Nature entered into a partnership with the OIC, Qatar Foundation, the UK’s Royal Society, Canada’s International Development Research Centre (IDRC) and the British Council to research these issues in more depth, through an Atlas of Islamic World Science and Innovation. This was an ambitious series of reports aimed at mapping the research and innovation systems of a selection of OIC countries, in order to better understand strengths, weaknesses and future potential across the Islamic world.\nThe Atlas project, which we both contributed to, was set up to help OIC countries identify what they could do better, and where they might collaborate. Perhaps the most glaring indicator was the fact that several of the world’s richest nations, within the OIC, spent less as a fraction of national wealth on knowledge and scholarship than many of the poorest - an average of just 0.5% of GDP.\nOf many individual contributions from that period, one by Pervez Hoodbhoy, a prominent physicist from Pakistan, stands out. In a 2007 article, Hoodbhoy asked: “With well over a billion Muslims and extensive material resources, why is the Islamic world disengaged from science and the process of creating new knowledge?” But he ended on a more upbeat note: “Science can prosper among Muslims once again, but only with a willingness to accept certain basic philosophical and attitudinal changes – a Weltanschauung that shrugs off the dead hand of tradition, rejects fatalism and absolute belief in authority, accepts the legitimacy of temporal laws, values intellectual rigour and scientific honesty, and respects cultural and personal freedoms.”\nSo ten years ago, policymakers, university and research leaders were cautiously positive in envisaging a transition in science and innovation performance across the Islamic world, despite persistent challenges. Then came the Arab revolutions of 2011. Few anticipated that the Middle East would come alive with the voices of young people demanding a say in how they are governed; a movement that was fuelled in part by poor educational opportunities and high youth unemployment.\nThese revolutions initially provided further cause for optimism. At the launch of the Atlas project report for Egypt in April 2012, we witnessed the rare spectacle of a government minister being grilled by a packed audience of students and young people. “How come you still have a job?” piped one. “What will you do to improve my job prospects,” asked another. Such was the changed dynamic that the minister had no choice but to engage with his youthful critics.\nBut amid the talk of paradigm shifts, as we know now, many brave women and men were crushed, often brutally, as existing regimes sought to reassert control. With the exception of Tunisia, their cries for freedom have largely fallen silent. And the subsequent rise of ISIS meant that many regimes parked other priorities – including science – in favour of spending on security, defence and deradicalisation.\nAlongside the return to a form of status quo, individual initiatives have continued to proliferate. Most significant has been the slow thaw in relations between Iran and the west, largely brought about by the efforts of the Obama administration and counterparts in the European Union. Few will forget the beaming smiles and handshakes as the nuclear deal was inked – in many respects, a triumph of science diplomacy.\nWhat the US perhaps did not realise (or chose to set aside) is the extent to which Iran was simultaneously ramping up its regional influence in scientific and other domains. One visible demonstration of this was a new Mustafa Prize for scientific excellence, intended to rival Saudi Arabia’s longstanding King Faisal prizes. This move was not lost on representatives of the Gulf states, most of which chose to respond to an invitation to the 2015 prize ceremony in Tehran by boycotting it.\nA further earthquake in regional politics was to follow with the elevation of Saudi defence minister Mohammad bin Salman as crown prince and de facto prime minister. The prince, though a liberalising force in Saudi society, regards Iran as Saudi Arabia’s principle regional threat.\nUnder Salman’s leadership, in its most aggressive foreign and defence policy of recent times, Saudi Arabia is fighting Iran-backed fighters in Yemen and has coordinated an air, land and sea blockade around neighbouring Qatar, which it accuses among other things of being too Iran-friendly. Saudi Arabia also appears to have engineered the sudden resignation of Lebanon’s prime minister Saad Hariri, where Iran-backed Hezbollah is a strong political force.\nAmid this regional turmoil, the science institutions of the OIC are soldiering bravely on, hosting their latest science and innovation summit in September 2017. One of the OIC science agencies, Comstech, has an energetic director general in the Pakistani nuclear physicist Shaukat Hameed Khan. He is fond of reminding the leaders of OIC member states that “science is disruptive and flourishes in an environment of irreverence”. Khan has a plan to create a network of scientific observatories (there are none of note in the Islamic world), and is confident that funding can be found.\nMeanwhile, at the Islamic Development Bank, the Saudi bioscientist and entrepreneur Hayat Sindi was appointed in April this year to a new advisory position, and has been tasked with reviewing the bank’s R&D funding and investments. And a taskforce, chaired by Zakri Abdul Hamid, science adviser to the prime minister of Malaysia, recently issued a call for universities across the Muslim world to create a voluntary network of excellence.\nAt the bilateral level, funding schemes such as the UK’s Newton Fund  are proving a useful vehicle for deepening scientific links with OIC countries such as Egypt, Indonesia, Jordan, Malaysia and Turkey. And on the multilateral plane, initiatives such as the World Science Forum, the Inter-Academy Panel, the World Academy of Sciences are important fora where OIC states can meet and work with each other under the umbrella of a neutral third party – or direct scientific efforts towards the less contentious UN Sustainable Development Goals.\nA decade ago, it seemed reasonable to take the OIC at its word – that it is a body capable of coordinating and bringing the best out of its disparate and diverse member states. With the luxury of hindsight, that assumption appears naïve. Within individual OIC member states and its collective institutions, there are numerous individuals desperate to bury ancient rivalries and work towards a common good. But at the highest levels of political leadership, the desire to cling onto power is now so evident that genuine pan-OIC cooperation looks further away than ever.\nIn the opening session of last week’s World Science Forum, Ireland’s chief scientific adviser Mark Ferguson made a poignant observation on the forum’s theme of “Science for Peace”. Science, he reminded the audience, cannot be the primary vehicle for peace in an environment where there are deep-rooted reasons for conflict. Science can reap the dividends, he argued, but “it cannot make the peace”.\nRight now, the nations of the OIC are heading towards what could be the defining crisis since the organisation’s foundation in 1969. Some would argue that the current battle between Sunni and Shiite groups, and their client states (Saudi Arabia and Iran), is an intractable conflict. We don’t subscribe to this view, but there is little doubt that wiser heads must prevail. Many opportunities to strengthen knowledge, learning and scholarship across the Islamic world exist independently of the OIC. Yet more effective and collective political leadership is crucial. Without it, the promise of an Islamic-world renaissance in science will forever remain a topic for history books.\nEhsan Masood is a Knight Science Journalism Fellow at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

        "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/22/kurdish-militias-fight-syrian-forces-hasaka",
        "text": "\nUS-backed Kurdish forces have fought against the Syrian army and militias in the north-east of the country for a fifth consecutive day, threatening to open a new front in the five-year war.\nThe clashes left at least two dozen civilians dead and caused people to flee to the surrounding countryside, days after the Syrian army began using planes and artillery to attack Kurdish areas in Hasaka.\nDilan Farhad, 25, a student from the city, told the Guardian: “The Syrian army started bombing our neighbourhood and we had to flee for our lives. The cries of a woman and her child are still ringing in my ears. They were wounded by the shelling.”\nAs regional dynamics and alliances shift, the fighting in this previously obscure city could undermine a the Obama administration’s campaign – of which the Kurds are a key component - to degrade and destroy Islamic State.\nIt also risks bringing the US into a more direct confrontation with Syria in defence of its Kurdish allies and American personnel based alongside them.\nThe US scrambled planes over Hasaka last week after Syrian jets attacked Kurdish positions near the city, warning that it would not tolerate any threat to the 300-plus special forces stationed in north-east Syria. Speaking to CNN, Lt Gen Stephen Townsend, the US commander for Syria and Iraq, said: “We will defend ourselves if we feel threatened.”\n\n\n\n\nKurds carve out new reality in northern Syria\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn official within the Democratic Union party (PYD), one of the dominant Kurdish parties in Syria, said the warning did not go far enough. “The Pentagon took a stand earlier on, but we need more,” Gharib Hasso told the Guardian. “The silence of the international coalition is not good. The war is expanding.” \nFor the past five years, the Kurds have carved out a region in the north amid the chaos in Syria, battling groups including Isis with their YPG militia while avoiding direct confrontation with Syrian government forces.\nThe Kurds’ resistance against Isis won favour with the US, which first intervened on the side of the YPG with airstrikes in September 2014, when the militants looked poised to overrun the border town of Kobani.\nSince then, cooperation between the two sides has deepened, with the US supporting the Kurds as part of the broader Syrian Democratic Forces. Backed by the coalition, the SDF recently recaptured the city of Manbij from Isis. On Sunday, Kurds in Turkey said a suspected suicide bombing that killed at least 50 people at a wedding in Gaziantep should be considered “a revenge attack” for the territorial gains of Kurdish forces there. \nFor Turkey, the growing influence of the Kurds and existence of a Kurdish entity on its southern border is unacceptable. Ankara views the YPG as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK), which has fought a three-decade insurgency against Turkey.\nTurkey has repeatedly complained to the US about its support for the YPG. On Sunday, the foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, said the government would “wipe out” the group. The previous day, the Turkish prime minister, Binali Yıldırım, said Turkey would play a more active role in Syria. “It means not allowing Syria to be divided along ethnic lines,” he said.\nThe fighting in Hasaka comes as relations thaw between Turkey and Russia, which are on opposite sides of the conflict, with Moscow a key ally of Damascus. Russia has previously supported the Kurds as a means of putting pressure on Ankara, which backs the rebels fighting the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad. Now that the two countries are on speaking terms, this could change. \n\n\n\n\nMail on Sunday wrong to use picture of a gun-toting journalist in Iraq\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbdula Salam Ahmad, a PYD official, said: “This was a result of a consensus between Russia, Iran, Syria and Turkey to foil the gains the Kurds have made in Syria. Turkey is not happy with the recent victory in Manbij ... Turkey wants to stop the Kurds.”\nIn the early days of the uprising, Assad withdrew most of his forces from Kurdish areas to focus on fighting rebels, leaving a small contingent of soldiers to man government bases in Hasaka and Qamishlo.\nTensions between the two forces have occasionally escalated into violence, most recently in April, when there were skirmishes in Qamishlo until a ceasefire was brokered.\nA YPG commander in Hasaka blamed Syrian soldiers for the latest flare-up. “The Syrian soldiers in Hasaka constantly harass residents, but for the past week, the harassment intensified,” Lawend Rojava told the Guardian. “We warned the soldiers, but it had no impact and that was when the fighting broke out.”\nThe Kurds say they have taken over most of the city and are intent on driving the Syrian army out of Hasaka.\nThe Iranian paramilitary Basij militia and Hezbollah are aiding Syrian forces in the two neighbourhoods of Hasaka that they still control. “The Iranians are overseeing the operation, but Hezbollah are fighting side by side with the Syrian soldiers,” said Rojava.\nFootage broadcast by a YPG-affiliated channel on Sunday showed Kurdish forces engaged in street battles with Syrian soldiers in Hasaka.\nOne of the fighters, speaking as he and three others dashed across a road strewn with bullet casings to avoid Syrian army sniper fire, said: “Neither with planes nor with tanks can they break us. We will continue our struggle.”\nAnother fighter carrying a machine gun told the Ronahi TV channel: “They must walk over our bodies if they want to conquer Hasaka. We will do to the Syrian army what we did to Daesh [an Arabic term for Isis].” \nDana Razgayi contributed to this report\n"

        "text": "\nTop story: ‘Most damaging thing in my life’\nHello, it’s Warren Murray with a briefing that will have to last you until Monday so we’d better make it count. \nPolice in London and New York have announced they are investigating sexual harassment allegations against Harvey Weinstein. The English actor Sophie Dix, meanwhile, has told the Guardian how her budding film career was ruined after the kind of hotel room assault by the movie producer that has become all-too-familiar reading.\nIn a scathing indictment on the industry, Dix said: “I was very, very vocal about it at the time … But I was met with a wall of silence.\n“People who were involved in the film were great, my friends and my family were amazing and very compassionate, but people in the industry didn’t want to know about it, they didn’t want to hear … It was massively damaging. It’s the single most damaging thing that’s happened in my life.”\nWeinstein himself has spoken to photographers in LA: “Guys, I’m not doing OK but I’m trying. I gotta get help … You know, we all make mistakes … second chance I hope.” He is reported to have sought counselling in Arizona. The British Oscar winner Emma Thompson, though, has declared that Weinstein is not “a sex addict, he’s a predator”. \n\nFail of two cities – Not much cheer about Brexit from either London or Brussels. The government has announced it has made so little progress that it cannot bring the withdrawal bill back to parliament next week. Debate has been postponed amid grappling over a string of hostile amendments. Turmoil continues within the governing party – the former chancellor Nigel Lawson has called for Philip Hammond to be removed as chancellor for refusing to countenance a “no deal” Brexit, while remainers continue to push for Boris Johnson’s sacking as foreign secretary. In Brussels, Michel Barnier has said talks remain at a “disturbing” deadlock, largely over the divorce settlement. But the pound rallied after a leaked European council document suggested Donald Tusk will ask the EU27 to start hammering out details of a future trading relationship with Britain.\n\nMeltdown averted – The temperature has cooled slightly around US dealings with Iran. Donald Trump is apparently backing away from a threat to derail Tehran’s nuclear limitation deal with the west. Instead, it is thought Trump will satisfy himself with making a stormy speech today denouncing Iranian behaviour, including its ballistic missile programme, and support for Syrian ruler Bashar al-Assad and Hezbollah. He is expected to foreshadow sanctions on Iran’s Revolutionary Guard (IRGC), and this is a potential flashpoint. But Julian Borger writes that European diplomats are sounding relieved overall about Trump’s position, with one saying: “Of all the places it could have been on the spectrum, this is very much at the better end.”\n\nFate of Sally Jones – The British militant Sally Jones was retreating with Isis from Raqqa in Syria when a drone strike likely killed her, along with her 12-year-old son, in June. Jones worked for Isis at its height, indoctrinating women and sending them on suicide missions, according to the picture that is emerging of her life. Her work made the shadowy “white widow” a top target for US and UK intelligence. Raqqa, once the Isis capital, is now thought to be within days of falling to Kurdish and Arab forces, and Islamic State’s foreign ranks are in steady decline, writes Martin Chulov.\n\nFalling from the sky – China’s out-of-control space station Tiangong-1 will crash to Earth sometime between now and next April, and no one really knows where. The 8.1-tonne orbiting laboratory was a big achievement for China when it was launched in 2011, but the country’s space agency lost control of it in 2016. The briefing has been quietly monitoring the situation ever since – check the graph in this morning’s story to see how Tiangong-1’s orbit has started a rapid decline. Experts say much of it will burn up in the atmosphere, and even though pieces weighing 100kg might make it all the way down, probability and past experience suggest it is unlikely anyone will be hurt.\n\nWorld of pain – Shortages of morphine and palliative care are leaving 25 million people a year dying in “horrendous and preventable pain”, including millions of children. The finding comes from a special commission set up by the Lancet medical journal, which found the situation was worst in poorer nations. Some governments are gripped by an “opiophobia”, a fear that letting morphine into hospitals will lead to addiction in the community. In other countries cost is the main issue, or authorities are simply indifferent to the suffering of impoverished, terminally ill patients. Morphine can and should be made available for “pennies”, says Prof Felicia Knaul, co-chair of the commission from the University of Miami: “[This is] one of the world’s most striking injustices”.\n\nRobot takes over UN – It was a freaky performance of jerky movements and stilted speech. But enough about Donald Trump’s address to the United Nations …\n\n\n \n\n\nPlay Video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1:43\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  'Sophia' the robot tells UN: 'I am here to help humanity create the future' – video\n\n\n“Sophia” the social android has answered questions in front of a UN audience. Deputy secretary general Amina J Mohammed at times looked confused about how to react as the robot gestured and held forth about the benefits of technology. Sophia didn’t threaten to “totally destroy little rocket man” or anything, but her statement that “AI and automation produce more results with less resources” sounded a bit alarming. The latex mask fell away for a bit when she mispronounced AI as “ah-dot-eye” – giving hope to people everywhere who read stuff out for a living that their jobs are safe for the moment. \n\n‘Extreme breeding’ – The intentional breeding of a bizarre-looking horse with a radically concave face has been greeted with shock by veterinarians. The “dished” look of Arabian horses (you can see an example in our story) is considered a mark of beauty on the equine show circuit – but an article in the Veterinary Record said the colt El Ray Magnum, from the Orrion Farms stud in Washington state, US, had such a deformed skull that it might struggle to breathe. Adele Waters, the editor of Veterinary Record, said every professional vet she had shown the images to had found them shocking: “There is no functional value in a horse having a face like that.” Orrion breeding adviser Doug Leadley said the horse was “close to perfection” and critics were just “people who don’t understand”.\nLunchtime read: ‘I hate how much we hate ourselves’\n“I process out loud,” says Pink, the relentlessly confessional pop star, promoting her new album Beautiful Trauma. “When I am the most uncomfortable and the most vulnerable and saying the most honest, shameful shit, that’s what’s getting to somebody else. And I’m basically having therapy and somebody else is getting something from it.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Pink: ‘Part of me is a fucker, and this is that.’ Photograph: Kurt Iswarienko\n\n\nShe might be a model of empowerment for girls and young women these days, and no longer the rebellious teenage “shithead” who was shunned as a bad influence by her friends’ parents. But there are still shades of danger – Eminem raps on the new record, and ejects familiar epithets like “slut” and “whore”. Pink doesn’t just defend it, she basks in it: “Look, there’s a part of me that’s a fucker, and this is that.”\nSport\nNasser-al-Khelaifi, the chairman of high-spending Paris Saint-Germain and powerful sports broadcaster beIN, has been accused in Switzerland of criminally bribing the former Fifa secretary general Jérôme Valcke to buy TV rights to World Cup tournaments. Meanwhile, burgeoning talent at youth level promises a brighter future for Gordon Strachan’s successor, who will seek to end the nation’s 22-year wait to reach a major finals.\nFrom a fringe player at the start of the season, to setting a record by hitting 52 home runs in the regular season, the best for a rookie and equal 28th on the all-time list, Aaron Judge has taken the US by storm in the space of seven months. Worcester racecourse has been branded a joke after a quicker and drier surface led to a total of 33 non‑runners, almost as many as the 41 horses who turned up, with two races being reduced to only two runners apiece. Finally, Australian Tim Cahill could land in hot water with Fifa after he appeared to undertake a “sponsored” goal celebration.\nBusiness\nThe strong stock market run has continued in Asia overnight with the Nikkei in Japan rising more than 1%. That followed a new record high on the FTSE100 in London on Thursday although it is tipped to fall slightly this morning at the open.On currency markets the pound is buying $1.327 and €1.12.\nThe papers\nHarvey Weinstein and Brexit are on many of the front pages again today. The Sun reports that British TV presenter Myleene Klass was propositioned: “Weinstein offered me sex contract”. The Mirror’s headline is “Movie boss preyed on me when I was a schoolgirl” and highlights the statement by the actor Kate Beckinsale and her frightening encounter with Weinstein when she was 17.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Guardian front page, 13 October 2017\n\n\nThe Mail also includes the Beckinsale story but splashes on Brexit matters. Its lead is “Sack ‘saboteur’ Hammond” and, in case its readers are in any doubt about where its sympathies lie, the paper calls the chancellor “Eyeore Phil”. The Guardian splashes with the “chaos” of EU talks and also highlights a “growing whispering campaign” against Hammond from within his own party. Much the same language in the Telegraph which says Theresa May’s Brexit plans are in disarray. The paper says British police are looking at a possible allegation of sexual assault by Harvey Weinstein. The Times features the “sack Hammond” narrative but leads with a shocking story saying more than 150 Vietnamese children rescued from traffickers have since disappeared from council care homes.

But “Martin” in the programme claimed this was an opportunistic move by the republican dissidents to promote the idea they had murdered a top British agent. \n“Martin” insisted the mainstream IRA killed Donaldson over his years of betrayal at the heart of the Irish republican movement. \nSpotlight claimed the Provisional IRA’s South Armagh brigade rather than the Real IRA demanded Donaldson be killed in an act of revenge for his treachery. \nIt said the convicted tax fraudster Thomas “Slab” Murphy, the jailed reputed leader of the IRA in South Armagh, personally asked the republican leadership that Donaldson be killed. \nDonaldson’s betrayal was a devastating blow for the mainstream republican movement as the former IRA prisoner was once part of Gerry Adams’ inner circle in Sinn Féin. \nAmong those the east Belfast republican served time with in the Maze prison was the IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands. He was exposed as an informer in 2005 and confessed publicly to working for Royal Ulster Constabulary special branch as well as other branches of the security forces for years. \nAmong his various roles for the IRA and Sinn Féin, Donaldson worked abroad forging relations with international militant groups including Palestinian factions and the Lebanese Hezbollah. At the time Donaldson was in the Middle East he was already working as a British spy.\nAdams has consistently denied ever being in the IRA.\n"

        "text": "\nTHE SEVENTH SIGN\nLike religion, politics and the best way to poach an egg, the subject of football can be a decidedly divisive one, sparking frank exchanges of views that regularly end in scenes of unseemly, outright violence. With debates about refereeing decisions, team selections and whether or not Lionel Messi could hack it on a wet night in Stoke regularly sundering relationships, there was until recently at least one thing everyone could agree on. Having seen them finish seventh in the Premier League before spending £140m on new talent during the summer, everyone with a passing interest in English football was unanimous in their belief that Everton would once again finish alone in their own little mini-league snuggled between sixth and eighth. Along with death and taxes, the Goodison Park outfit finishing seventh in the table next May was one of few certainties in life.\nBut that was then and this is now … a decidedly unexpected “now” in which Ronald Koeman’s underwhelming collection of overpriced scampering midfield playmakers and Wayne Rooney have won just two of their first seven league matches and are licking their wounds after having their derrieres handed to them in their own back yard by Burnley. It was their fourth league defeat of the season and leaves them 16th, nine places below their allotted, carved-in-granite place in the pecking order. Trying to replace Romelu Lukaku was never going to be easy, but barely trying is beginning to look a rather monumental act of folly.\n\n\n\n\nEverton’s Farhad Moshiri: Ronald Koeman has my total support\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the crisis klaxon currently hooting around Goodison Park and Koeman reduced to praising the “effort” of his players for want of anything else to enthuse about, Everton’s majority shareholder Farhad Moshiri has proffered the worrying vote of confidence that generally signals a manager is about to be ushered towards the door marked Do One. Through the medium of his confidante, broadcasting’s Jim White, Moshiri agreed that Everton fans deserved better, but that Koeman was not coming under pressure from upstairs. “We are in a bad moment,” he said, in a bespoke statement neatly embroidered on one of Jim’s old Deadline Day ties. “There is mental and physical fatigue and seven [knacks]. These are early days and Koeman has my total support. We have great fans and they deserve better. We know the honest and objective expectations of our supporters and will not let them down.” Translation: seventh it is, then and you can take that to the bank.\nWhile Everton fans are a reasonably patient bunch whose expectations are far from outlandish, many have voiced their irritation with Koeman’s comment that he saw plenty of reasons to be cheerful in the defeat by Burnley. “I am pleased with the performance of all the players,” he tooted. “What the team showed today was positive.” Meanwhile on Lazy Journalist Story Generator, he praised the “commitment” of his players in a tweet that could scarcely have spawned more outrage if it had been written by Katie Hopkins and endorsed the clubbing of baby seals. Brighton are up next and with the Goodison Park natives getting restless, another defeat could spark open revolt. \nQUOTE OF THE DAY\n“Our live subtitling service is normally very accurate and makes our content much more accessible, but there are times when unfortunate errors occur” – a BBC suit apologises for the subtitling error branding Newcastle “black and white scum” during Match of the Day 2.

        "text": "\nI was shocked by the letter (17 December) from Tony Greenstein and others about the government adopting the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition of antisemitism. The letter said: “The new definition has nothing to do with opposing antisemitism, it is merely designed to silence public debate on Israel’s crimes against the Palestinians. Antisemitic incidents comprise about 2% of all hate crime. Why then the concentration on antisemitism and not on Islamophobia, which is far more widespread?”\nThose assertions are all either misleading or false and seem to say that antisemitism in Britain doesn’t matter. It is true that religiously based hate crime represents a very small percentage of all hate crime. In 2015 out of about 66,000 hate crimes in the UK, about 5,000 were on grounds of religion and, of those, about 1,000 attacks each were antisemitic and Islamophobic. Both types of attack are as abhorrent as each other. The British Jewish population is less than 10% of the size of the British Muslim population, so the Jewish community is facing far more frequent racist attacks pro rata than the Muslim community. In fact, the attacks on the Jewish community are concentrated on those who are easily identified as being Jewish, including those going to or from Jewish community centres, events or synagogues. Secular Jews are frequently unaware of such attacks.\nThe new definition of antisemitism that the government has adopted specifically states that “criticism of Israel similar to that levelled against any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic”. It does, however, define “applying double standards by requiring of it a behaviour not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation” as antisemitic. Is that what they want to do?\nThere is nothing in the new definition that would stifle legitimate criticism of Israel. When unjustified criticism of Israel is published in the media, such as the false report of a massacre in Jenin, antisemitic attacks in the UK increase, so this new definition is needed. Islamophobia does not increase in response to reports of the Israel-Palestine dispute. It does increase in response to reports of jihadi attacks in the west. That is also unfair on Muslims in Britain who are strongly opposed to terrorism. But it is no reason to make light of antisemitism in Britain.Stephen FranklinLondon\n• Deplorable though the Netanyahu government’s settlement policy is, the description by the usual pro-BDS suspects of Israel as “an apartheid state” is ludicrous. This is a country whose minority Arab citizens have, and exercise, the vote, are represented in the Knesset, local government, the judiciary, academia and the press, and whose religion, whether Muslim or Christian, is freely practised.\nThat is not to say more does not need to be done to enhance provision for Israel’s Arab citizens, especially the Bedouin, but it would be a welcome change if those who constantly denounce Israel for failings real, exaggerated or imagined spent a fraction of their energy protesting about the slaughter in Syria, many of whose citizens are being treated in Israeli hospitals, or the actions of Hamas and Hezbollah.Jeremy BeechamLabour, House of Lords\n• My question to the letter’s signatories is simple: how many of you have actually visited Israel? If you have had any kind of in-depth visit to Israel, you must have noticed how many Arabs study at its universities. How many of the doctors and teachers are Arab. How many checkout staff in the supermarkets are Arab, working side by side with Israelis. Do you see separate seating on buses and in public places for Arabs and non-Arabs? No. That is what apartheid was, and it is not practised in any shape or form in Israel.Ann LevinRa’anana, Israel\n• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com\n• Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters\n"

        "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/02/donald-trump-travel-ban-terrorism-data",
        "text": "\nDonald Trump has relied upon a dubious statistic to support his ban on travel to the US from seven majority-Muslim countries, terrorism researchers and databases indicate.\nTrump, in his Tuesday night address to Congress, cited unspecified data from the Department of Justice to claim that the “vast majority” of people convicted of terrorism-related offenses in the US since 9/11 “came here from outside of our country”.\n\n\n\n\nTrump hails 'new chapter in American greatness' in Congress speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAhead of unveiling a new version of the ban in the coming days, Trump marshalled the statistic to contend that his draconian approach was necessary to prevent a “beachhead of terrorism” inside the US.\nThough Trump did not specify the source for his data, several terrorism scholars have identified it as a justice department compilation released last year by Jeff Sessions, now Trump’s attorney general. Neither the justice department nor the White House responded to requests from the Guardian about the statistics.\nHowever, several leading terrorism scholars cautioned that the convictions data in the Sessions document painted an inaccurate picture of terrorism in the United States.\n“Those figures are technically correct if you count only international terrorism-related cases as calculated by the Department of Justice, but it is substantively misleading because it doesn’t include domestic terrorism and it does include a large number of cases that pose no threat to the United States,” said Charles Kurzman, a University of North Carolina professor who tallies data on American Muslim extremists. \n“That would include people attempting to travel abroad, financing of movements abroad, sometimes in very small amounts, and a couple hundred cases from the years right after 9/11, with no known link to terrorism, that are nonetheless included on that list.”\nThe thinktank New America Foundation also keeps a database of those charged with terrorism – not only those convicted of it – in federal courts since 9/11. It focuses on Sunni jihadist terrorism such as efforts by al-Qaida and Isis, excluding terror organizations such as Colombia’s Farc or Lebanon’s Hezbollah, as well as white-supremacist terrorism in the US. \nAccording to New America’s database, 84% of jihadist terrorism-related offenses in the US since 9/11 are attributable to US citizens or permanent residents. A quarter of such offenders, New America’s researchers found, are converts, “further confirming the challenge cannot be reduced to one of immigration”.\nData kept by the University of Maryland’s National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (Start) backs up the New America finding. \nOne of its datasets, Profiles of Individual Radicalization in the United States (Pirus) goes far beyond jihadist terrorism, to study 1,500 individuals radicalized in the US from 1948 to 2013. Its definition of radical extremism is far broader than the “radical Islamic terrorism” formulation Trump embraces, including far-right and far-left terrorism. Approximately 90% of its cases are US citizens, and the vast majority natural-born, according to the Pirus researcher Patrick James. \nRestricting the data to post-9/11 instances of domestic radicalization to Sunni jihadist terrorism – also a category broader than terrorism convictions – James found that of 207 cases, 109 were natural-born American citizens. The remaining 98 cases were first-generation immigrants radicalized inside the US. Since the breakdown is in roughly the same proportion to the broader US Muslim community, James said, “you can’t say the first generation is more of an at-risk community”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  A protest march in New York against the travel ban,\nwhich was halted by a US court. A new version of the ban is set to be unveiled soon. Photograph: Timothy A. Clary/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\nSimilarly, an intelligence report from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) undercuts the premise of Trump’s ban on immigration from seven majority-Muslim countries. DHS’s bureau of intelligence and analysis (I&A) concluded that “country of citizenship is unlikely to be a reliable indicator of potential terrorist activity”.\nCiting US justice department press releases on convictions since the Syrian civil war began in 2011, DHS intelligence analysts found that “slightly more than half” of 82 people identified as convicted of terrorism offenses in the US or killed in the pursuit of them were “native-born United States citizens”.\nCitizens of the seven banned countries were “rarely implicated in US-based terrorism”. Iran, Sudan and Yemen each had one. Syria had none. Somalia had three such citizens; Iraq, which Trump is considering exempting from the revised ban, had two. \nGillian Christensen, a DHS spokesperson, dismissed the analysis as “commentary from open source reporting versus an official, robust document with thorough interagency sourcing. The I&A report does not include data from other intelligence community sources. It is clear on its face that is an incomplete product that fails to find evidence of terrorism by simply refusing to look at all the available evidence.”\nSeveral researchers believe Trump’s citation derived from a June 2016 Senate subcommittee tally tallying 580 people convicted of terrorism-related charges from 9/11 to 2014. That tally, led by then-senator Sessions, found 73% of convicts were foreign born. \n\n\n\n\nTweet and delete: US officials erase their praise for Iranian Oscar winner\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe University of Maryland’s James called the tally a “dubious” overcount.\n“Just looking at some of the cases, a lot of them weren’t charged with anything related to terrorism. Sometimes bringing a case to court, they’ll just be charged with something like illegal weapons possession or fraud or embezzlement that they may think had something to do with terrorism, but it’s not actually brought to court, so it becomes hard to count. It becomes kind of a moving target,” James said.\nThe New America Foundation’s David Sterman said Trump was applying “a kitchen-sink approach to cases that are often neither actually terrorism cases nor cases that demonstrate a need for the travel ban” but instead “justify his preferred policy position, when more detailed examination of the origins of jihadist terrorism in the US find they’re overwhelmingly US citizens or legal residents.”\nNarrowing in on fatalities caused by Muslim terrorists in the US since 9/11, the University of North Carolina’s Kurzman observed, “only one-sixth were due to immigrants and most of those, within that one-sixth, would not have been caught by ‘extreme vetting’, because they arrived as children. \n“Of the seven countries still being considered [for the travel ban], there have been no fatalities at all from the United States caused by immigrants from those countries or immigrants’ children or grandchildren.” \n"

Herzog said he was “appalled” by Livingstone’s assertion that when Hitler won his 1932 election, “his policy then was that Jews should be moved to Israel”. After suspending Livingstone from the party, Corbyn was invited by Herzog to Yad Vashem “to witness that the last time the Jews were forcibly transported it was not to Israel but to their deaths”.\nCorbyn did not reply for several weeks, but officials confirmed to the Observer he had told Herzog his diary was too full and McNicol would go instead.\nJoan Ryan MP, chair of Labour Friends of Israel, accused Corbyn of a failure of leadership which would fuel debate about his views on the Middle East.“I’m very disappointed Jeremy turned down the invitation to visit Israel from our sister party.

        "text": "\nThe fight for Aleppo is at an end. The clusters of desperate Syrians who remain huddled in the last rebel redoubt face an imminent reckoning, to yield to loyalist forces across the nearby dividing line or to stay and face capture. Or to accept the terms of a last-minute deal that allows anyone left to flee.\nAleppo will be cleansed of the the anti-Assad opposition and anyone who sympathised with it. Those who do flee, or who win the mercy of the conquerors will face exile, likely in Idlib province, a bastion of the latest incarnation of the al-Qaida inspired Jabhat al-Nusra, which is prescribed as a terrorist group by all of the war’s protagonists. \n\n\n\n\nReports of Aleppo civilians shot on the spot by pro-regime forces – UN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdlib will hardly be a refuge. After Aleppo, it will be the last urban stronghold – except for Isis-held Raqqa – outside regime control. Rebel communities from other defeated corners of Syria have already been sent there after regime victories, where they have continued to be bombed by Russian and Syrian jets.\nThe presence of jihadis offers the perfect pretext for the attacks to continue – their conflation with the rebels has been a constant theme of the regime narrative that it is fighting terrorist groups. Having them all mixed together serves such messaging usefully and portends poorly for the vanquished.\nAssad’s claims that the fate of Aleppo will prove decisive in the war will probably be proved true. But the throes of victory obscure another, more enduring, truth: that stability will remain elusive for a long time to come. So too will a central tenet of Assad’s claim to continued leadership: sovereignty.\nAssad has been helped into a winning position by Iran and Russia, who have done far more than his beleaguered military to all but defeat the opposition. Iran has had effective strategic control over how the war is run for the past three years. Militias from Lebanon and Iraq, which Tehran arms and organises, have been instrumental in overrunning eastern Aleppo, a goal that had remained well out of reach of Syrian forces since they were ousted from the city in mid-2012.\nAnd from above, the scale and reach of Russian firepower has rained down on a city that has successfully sheltered insurrections throughout the ages. The devastation of eastern Aleppo is staggering. Think Hama in 1982, a massacre ordered by Assad’s late father, Hafez al-Assad, which killed an estimated 20,000 people, and which took place away from the world’s gaze.\nIn that sense, Aleppo is different; the suffering has been on regular display. It has been so long and agonising, and the international response so insipid, that many observers have been begging for it to end.\n\n\n\n\nMPs to debate how UK can help civilians trapped in Aleppo 'hellhole'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssad has shown no sign that he will apply the mercy rule. And nor do his backers, who for different reasons appear determined to segue this win into an all-out victory across the country. This is where things will become problematic for the Syrian leader, who owes his continued presence in the presidential palace to Tehran and Moscow. Both powers will take a driving stake in what comes next and, while there has thus far been common ground for them in ensuring Assad survives and Syria keeps its territorial integrity, the next phase of the conflict will probably prove trickier for Assad to navigate.\nIran wants a postwar Syria that reinforces Damascus as a bridgehead for Hezbollah – an essential arm of its political military projection vis-à-vis Israel and the US. Iranian officials also claim their role in winning the war gives them more of a say in defining the national character of Syria, which they have been invested in since shortly after the Islamic revolution of 1979, though not on this scale.\nA resurgent Russia is also sure to explore the spoils. Vladimir Putin has brought himself a say, and a base in the post-Arab Spring region through which he can project Russian influence. Russia is ascendant in the region, at the expense of the US, the influence of which friend and foe alike acknowledge has waned. None of this augurs well for those in the last ravaged corner of Aleppo, or hunkering down in Idlib, where the victors will certainly come for them. \nThe grievances that fuelled the conflict remain fundamentally unaddressed. Sunni disaffection is one important, and sometimes overriding factor. And, without a political process that addresses this, a military victory will not mean much in the long term. \nThe misery and uncertainty is entering a new phase. But it is not over yet.\n"

        "text": "\nSamir Qantar, a Lebanese militant leader who spent nearly three decades in an Israeli prison after being convicted of carrying out one of the most notorious attacks in Israeli history, has been killed in a rocket attack on a building in the Syrian capital, Damascus.\nQantar, a high-profile figure in Hezbollah, was killed alongside eight others after multiple rocket attacks on a building in the suburb of Jaramana. The militant Shia group confirmed his death in a statement sent to the Guardian. It called him “our martyr” and blamed Israel for the killing.\nHezbollah’s al-Manar TV reported that two Israeli warplanes violated Syrian airspace and fired four long-range missiles at the residential building. It aired footage of what it said was the building, which appeared to be completely destroyed.\nIsrael has not claimed responsibility for the attack. While Israeli military officials have refused to comment, other Israeli officials praised Qantar’s death in Syria. “I am very happy,” said the justice minister, Ayelet Shaked. “He was an arch-terrorist who bashed a four-year-old girl in the skull with a rock and expressed no regret.”\nHours after Qantar’s death was reported, three rockets, apparently fired from Lebanon, struck open areas in northern Israel, Israel’s military said. There were no reports of injuries.\nQantar was sentenced to three life terms in Israel in 1979 after he and three other Lebanese men staged an attack in the northern coastal town of Nahariya that year, killing a policeman and then kidnapping a man, Danny Haran, and his four-year-old daughter and killing them outside their home.\nIsrael says Qantar, who was 16 at the time, beat the girl to death by bashing her head with a rifle butt. He denied this, saying the girl was killed in the crossfire. As the attack unfolded, the girl’s mother, Smadar Haran, hid inside a crawl space inside their home and accidentally suffocated their crying two-year-old daughter, fearing Qantar would find them.\nHaran, the only survivor of the attack, said of Qantar’s death: “I felt a kind of relief. It’s not that I was looking for revenge or retaliation, but when I heard about a year ago that Samir Qantar had become very active in the Hezbollah forces just north of Israel, I worried about the fact that he might go and kill other families and kill children.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Danny Haran and his daughters Eynat and Yael. Photograph: AP\n\n\nQantar was released as part of a deal for the release of the bodies of IDF reservists Ehud Goldwasser and Eldad Regeve in July 2008, and received a hero’s welcome upon his return to Lebanon. Soon afterwards, Qantar joined Hezbollah, and he quietly rose through the group’s ranks, particularly following its involvement in the civil war in Syria in support of Bashar al-Assad’s forces.\nYaakov Amidror, a former director of the Israeli counter-terrorism bureau, said Qantar had been operating in the northern Golan Heights and was planning attacks on Israel before his death. Amidror said: “As most of the villages on the Syrian side of the Golan Heights were Druze, it was easy for Hezbollah to bring in an actor who is a Druze and who has good relations there,. He was very active, not alone, with other members of Hezbollah.”\nYuval Steinitz, an Israeli cabinet minister, said he was not sorry about Qantar’s death but could not comment on allegations that Israel was behind the killing. He said: “If something happened to him, I think that no civilised person can be sorry. But again I learned it from the reports in the international media and I can make no concrete reference to it.”\nThe Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu did not comment about the strike in his weekly cabinet meeting.\nQantar’s brother Bassam Qantar issued a statement on Facebook saying his sibling was a martyr. “With pride we mourn the martyrdom of the leader Samir Qantar and we are honoured to join families of martyrs,” he wrote.\n Syria’s state media blamed “terrorist groups” for the attack. But government loyalists said the explosions were an Israeli airstrike.\nHezbollah has organised a funeral service for Qantar, due to be held in Beirut on Monday morning. \nHezbollah’s al-Mayadeen TV station said Farhan al-Shaalan, a senior commander with the anti-Israeli “resistance” movement in the Golan Heights, was also killed in the incident, together with an aide to Qantar.\n\n\n\n\nQantar gets hero's welcome on return to Lebanon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIsrael possesses long-range air-to-surface missiles that conceivably could have been fired from Israeli-controlled airspace. The Golan Heights is about 25 miles from Damascus.\nIsraeli warplanes have struck targets inside Syria several times during the country’s nearly five-year conflict, although it has rarely confirmed its involvement. Qantar’s killing would mark the first Israeli assassination of a senior figure inside Syria since Russia launched its military operations on 30 September in support of Assad.\nIsrael’s defence minister has said Russia and Israel have worked out an open communication system “to prevent misunderstandings”. That raises the question of whether the Russians would have been informed by Israel about any operation to kill Qantar. The Russian defence ministry declined to comment on the airstrike. \n• The photograph was changed on 21 December 2015 to better reflect the content of the article.\n"

        "text": "\nHorrific images and stories of starving children have suddenly flooded the media as the reality of life in the town of Madaya in Syria, besieged by Syrian regime sources and Hezbollah, has surfaced. But what is perhaps more shocking than the images is how the deliberate targeting of the population of Madaya has been taking place since July 2015 without the international community noticing.\nThis is despite activists in Madaya desperately trying to direct global attention to the atrocities committed there by the Syrian regime and its ally Hezbollah. It is only when the situation in Madaya reached the level of mass starvation that the international media have paid attention.\n\n\n\n\nMadaya: residents of besieged Syrian town say they are being starved to death\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Syrian regime and Hezbollah have put Madaya under siege for more than six months now as a response to the siege of the northern towns of Fua and Kefraya by anti-regime forces. In besieging Madaya and neighbouring Zabadani on the Lebanese border, the regime is trying to pressure its rebel opponents to agree to a population transfer between the two sets of towns that would consolidate regime control over Syrian towns bordering Lebanon. The regime’s plan is to empty Zabadani and Madaya from Sunni residents and populate them with Shia who would be brought in from Fua and Kefraya. This “sectarian cleansing” would allow the Shia Hezbollah to consolidate its control over areas serving as supply lines for regime strongholds in Damascus and the Syrian coast (the Sahel) as well as for Hezbollah itself.\nMadaya is not the only town in Syria being starved by the regime. And its population is not unique in enduring regime barrel bombing and other atrocities. But the humanitarian catastrophes in Syria have been overshadowed by stories about Islamic State. Much media attention is directed at Isis activities both in Syria and worldwide, while the conditions of life in Syria in areas beyond Isis territories are relatively ignored, especially in the western media.\nOne reason for this selective attention is that Isis is now a global problem. It has many Europeans in its ranks, and has engaged in attacks in the west. As such, Isis has become closer to being considered “our problem” by the west, while the wider problems faced by Syrians are relegated to the status of issues “far away”.\n\n\n\n\n \n\nThe Syrian conflict is proving to be too complicated for a media landscape with a short attention span\n\n\nIsis is also a recognisable evil. It is an entity on which there is agreement by states around the world, probably all of whom consider it a terrorist organisation. Its mode of operation, based on severe violence, may be an upgraded form of what groups such as al-Qaida engage in but it is ultimately familiar. It also fits within the type of “evil” stemming from the Middle East that the western media have been covering for decades – violent Islamic extremism. It is much more comfortable to fall back on familiar tropes that require little explanation than to explore the nuances of a different type of oppression, such as a brutal regime engaged in mass slaughter and starvation of its own populations, especially when this regime tries to sell itself as the best guarantee against extremism in Syria.\nAnd here lies the heart of the issue, which is that the Syrian conflict is proving to be too complicated for a media landscape with a short attention span, and for global audiences with little background in the current affairs and history of the Middle East. It is also a conflict that has been going on for almost five years, generating media fatigue.\nWhat is needed is not spontaneous panic that highlights crises then promptly dies down, but sustained, active focus on the multiple dimensions of the conflict beyond the problem of Isis, and a commitment to seeking to report facts that take us out of our comfort zone.\n"

        "text": "\nThe Orlando LGBT nightclub killer described himself as an “Islamic soldier” out to avenge the US war on the Islamic State, according to his phone conversations with police during the 12 June massacre.\n\n\n\n\nHow the Orlando shooting unfolded: 'He came in with the intent of evil'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo show progress in its investigation, the FBI on Monday released a timeline and partial transcript of Omar Mateen’s 911 calls from the Pulse nightclub. Investigators are said to be looking with skepticism at Mateen’s claim of allegiance to Isis.\nWhile the FBI initially withheld the full transcript of Mateen’s first call, omitting his name and references to the Islamic State, a brief furor that saw the speaker of the House accuse the FBI of “selective editing” led the US justice department to release the full transcript of the first call later on Monday. It released neither the audio of the call nor the transcripts of Mateen’s subsequent calls with Orlando police from inside the nightclub.\nIn the phone calls, whose contents took place during the killing spree, Mateen pledges fealty to Isis leader “Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi ... on behalf of the Islamic State”. The US war on Isis in Iraq and Syria motivated Mateen to be “out here right now”, he says on a different call.\nYet during Mateen’s 911 calls, which unfolded in three phases from 2.35am to 4.29am, the killer also releases false information, including an empty threat of possessing explosive vests and a promise of vehicles rigged to detonate.\n“In the next few days, you’re going to see more of this type of action going on,” Mateen says, something the FBI said as early as the day of the shooting was not a risk stemming from the nightclub assault.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n \nFBI: Orlando shooter was ‘calm and chilling’ during massacre\n\n\nThe FBI surprised observers within hours of Mateen’s death, which ended the killing with 49 dead and 53 wounded, by announcing that it considered the mass shooting to be terrorism. While Mateen had on three occasions in 2013 and 2014 been interviewed by officials investigating terrorism, the bureau closed those early inquiries for lack of factual predication to continue. Mateen was also considered to have fabricated a connection to the Boston Marathon bombers. \nA feature of Isis terrorism is to permit anyone who so chooses to use its name to advance mutual goals, regardless of any actual ties to the group. On Thursday the CIA director, John Brennan, testified that his agency had found no connection between Mateen and Isis. \nInvestigators have said they are examining Mateen’s apparently tortured sexuality as a possible motive or contributing factor. Several acquaintances have considered Mateen to have been closeted and at war internally with his sexual identity. \nNPR reported that investigators have not found telltale signs associated with Islamist radicalization, such as a change in mosques or abrupt shifts in behavior or family associations. \n“We don’t know the true nature of what his allegiance may or may not be. He claimed allegiance to both [Isis] and Hezbollah, even though both [Isis] and Hezbollah are fighting each other. Unless he’s of a Swiss bent, I don’t know we can just take his word for his allegiances,” said a US security official who was not cleared to speak for the record, adding that previous Mateen statements “have either been disproven or been incongruous with reality”.\nThe unfolding FBI inquiry, the official said, could “go anywhere from [Mateen being] a true radical at the time he pulled the trigger to a deep sense of self-loathing at potentially being homosexual, a self-loathing which has its own dangerous effects”.\nMateen began his attack on Pulse at 2.02am. He first contacted 911 dispatchers at 2.35am, for a boast-filled conversation that lasted about 50 seconds and began with a familiar Arabic preamble of respect for God. It was on that call that Mateen declared loyalty to Isis. \nIn two subsequent waves, at 3.03am and then 3.24am, Mateen was in contact with police crisis negotiators responding to his assault. On those calls, Mateen alluded to Isis’s November attack in Paris, although the CIA’s Brennan contrasted that attack with Mateen’s, as Isis command in Syria ordered the carnage in France. \nThe FBI alluded to learning “significant information” on the attack from survivors it was able to evacuate by removing an air conditioning unit through a back Pulse window around 4.21am. By 4.29am, according to the FBI timeline, survivors told police Mateen threatened to release waves of hostages strapped with explosive vests. In fact, Mateen did not possess any on the scene. \nBy 5.02am, Swat and hazardous-device units of the Orlando police breached the exterior of the club. Police reported shooting Mateen dead 13 minutes later. \nIt remained unclear why the FBI released only partial aspects of Mateen’s 911 calls, which constitute the lion’s share of evidence for his claimed allegiance to Isis, and continued to withhold the transcripts of his later calls to police. Reportedly, Mateen repeated his invented connections to the Boston Marathon bombers on the call, as well as pledging simultaneous loyalties to Isis enemy Hezbollah and rival al-Qaida.\nThe US attorney general, Loretta Lynch, told CNN on Sunday that releasing the full transcript risked “re-victimizing those people that went through this horror”.\nReleasing the initial excerpts, the FBI said it was “at this time” withholding the full transcripts, the audio, and the names of Mateen and the “person/group to whom he pledged allegiance” owing to “respect for the victims of this horrific tragedy”.\nBut after House speaker Paul Ryan and others accused the FBI of downplaying Mateen’s declarations of adherence to the Islamic State, the US justice department issued the unredacted transcript of Mateen’s first call, saying that the suspicions the withheld sections engendered caused “an unnecessary distraction from the hard work that the FBI and our law enforcement partners have been doing to investigate this heinous crime.”\nRyan cheered the justice department for “revers[ing] its decision,” but continued to criticize the handling of the episode.\n “The attempt to selectively edit the record reflects a broader, more serious problem: this administration’s continued effort to downplay and distract from the threat of radical Islamist terrorism,” Ryan said. \n"

        "text": "\nExhausted parents clutching terrified children in their arms, young people pushing the old in makeshift carts or wheelchairs and families pulling overstuffed suitcases: the scenes from east Aleppo are those of a new exodus. As Syrian government forces move on the last urban stronghold of the anti-Assad opposition, helped by Shia militias from Iraq, Iran and Hezbollah, hundreds of men have been rounded up and disappeared. Their relatives, as well as human rights activists, fear they may already be dead, or have become victims of Assad’s network of jails and torture centres where thousands have been murdered.\n\n\n\n\nAleppo families fear for 500 men seized by forces loyal to Assad\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Syrian and Russian onslaught has been going on for weeks. But now it is at a new intensity, as it approaches what may be the end game. A strategy of indiscriminate bombing, terror and destruction, the UN was told, threatens to turn this part of Syria’s second city into a giant graveyard. Syrian army leaflets dropped on the city warn the inhabitants that they must flee, or face annihilation.\nRebel-held Aleppo seems condemned to utter destruction and defeat. Posted on social media, citizens’ desperate messages resemble final pleas, all hope gone. A UN representative has described the situation as a “descent into hell”. US Department of State officials have made it clear that nothing much can be done; western countries have convened an emergency security council meeting, but beyond words of condemnation and warnings of a humanitarian catastrophe in the making – France has spoken of “what could be the biggest massacres of civilian population since the second world war” – the powerlessness of UN institutions is obvious. In London, at prime minister’s questions , the SNP’s Angus Robertson at least got the Syrian crisis into the discussion. Labour again passed by on the other side.\nMeanwhile, Russia’s propaganda machine is hard at work alongside the Syrian regime’s, trying to frame these events as the “liberation” of a population described as hostages of Islamic terrorists. This is as false as it is cynical. “Terrorists” is the label attached to the opposition to Assad ever since the outbreak of the 2011 street uprising against his dictatorship – a revolution that morphed into a full-on civil war after the Damascus government decided to deploy military power, including missiles, barrel bombs and chemical weapons, against its own population. By the summer of 2015, President Assad seemed on the verge of being overthrown. Then Russia launched its military intervention – all the while paying lip service to a diplomatic process the US administration pursued to no avail.\n\n\n\n\nThe battle for eastern Aleppo in maps: how rebel territory is shrinking\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRussia’s move was aimed at reversing the war’s dynamics and consolidating its beleaguered ally, President Assad. Entrenched in Syria, with powerful S-400 air defence systems installed, it took advantage of western reluctance to get embroiled in the conflict, at a time when Washington had made plain that its priority was fighting Islamic State (Isis), rather than putting an end to the massacres carried out by President Assad’s forces. Russia has not only turned a blind eye to these atrocities, it has assisted them. In Moscow, officials now indicate that the situation in east Aleppo will be “resolved” by the end of the year. Make no mistake, that means that the estimated 250,000 inhabitants still remaining at the start of this week will be forced either to leave, or face arrest or death.\nThe fate of rebel-held Aleppo spells the abject failure of the west’s contradictory and piecemeal policies. It is a humiliation for the UN. Its fall will be an unequivocal victory for Russian strategy. Aleppo will join an infamous list of cities whose names are synonymous with mass crimes committed while the world looked impotently on: Srebrenica, Grozny, even Guernica. Once again, it’s never again. The consequences, both for radicalisation and for the balance of power in the region, are hard to fathom exactly. But they will not be good.\n"

        "text": "\nToday’s news that the American secretary of state, John Kerry, and the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, are in Geneva to discuss ending the war in Syria should raise everyone’s spirits. Why does it not do so?\nThe answer is that these and other outside powers have tried this often before and failed. They have failed in large part because each is also helping the war to continue by aiding their chosen participants. So a quarter of a million Syrians have died, millions been displaced and a relic of world civilisation has been destroyed. The reality is that, ever since America first invaded the Middle East in 2003, the outside world’s policy towards Syria has been a textbook example of diplomatic failure.\nIn 2011, the intelligence community (and its media cheerleaders) predicted Assad would go the way of other Arab spring dictators. He would fall and the west could then nurture Syria into a new dawn of western-style democracy. When this failed to occur, the hawks (including Britain’s David Cameron) advocated that the west invade and topple him, installing a government of “our” Syrians, at peace with each other and the world.\nThe moral of Afghanistan, Iraq, Egypt and Libya is that the world rarely behaves as western punditry requires. Other nations have ways – and wars – of their own. The Syrian horror began with a sectarian insurgency of Syria’s own peculiar making. When it became evident that Assad was not going to fall, the west aided his foes with money, weapons and, above all, hope. They were soon joined by Isis, expanding out of the Sunni safe havens ceded them by the ham-fisted American/British intervention in Iraq. With Russia and Hezbollah drawn into backing Assad, the recipe for a perfect storm was in place. So it has been ever since.\nReality in this part of the world is that order and power seem invariably to trump “western-style” democracy. The west’s support for Assad’s enemies, like its toppling of Saddam and Gaddafi, aided the cause not of democracy but of chaos. It displayed the arrogance of empire without its true commitment. It dabbled, disregarding the old maxim, better a thousand years of tyranny than one day of anarchy.\nThe outside world has two simple duties towards the civil wars of others. One is not to take sides, to “give war a chance” to resolve internal conflict, and not fuel its terrors with weapons, bombs or hope of reinforcement. The other is to aid those fleeing the horrors of war when they throw themselves on the mercy of a wider humanity.\nThese duties we can perform – but fail to do so. They are unlikely to be on the agenda in Geneva.\n"

        "text": "\nRussian officials and Syrian rebel groups are holding talks in Turkey on the fate of east Aleppo as food reserves in the enclave dwindle to zero, opposition and diplomatic sources said on Thursday.\nThe negotiations have been under way in Ankara for a week. The deal on the table involves a ceasefire and an opening of corridors for delivering humanitarian aid in return for the departure from the city of extremists among the enclave’s defenders. \nIt is a similar bargain to the one proposed in October by the UN envoy on the Syrian conflict, Staffan de Mistura. However, although the plight of east Aleppo is even more desperate now, the arrest or disappearance of hundreds of men stopped at regime checkpoints as they fled the area in the past week has undermined trust in Moscow’s guarantees of safe passage out of the city through government-controlled areas. \nThe level of trust at the Ankara talks is also low because Russia has been leading a relentless aerial bombing campaign against east Aleppo that has caused mass civilian casualties. Russia is now perceived as having declining influence in Aleppo over regime forces and the Iranian-led militias spearheading the house-to-house fighting in the ruined city.\n\n\n\n\nThe battle for eastern Aleppo in maps: how rebel territory is shrinking\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The Russians are playing a double game,” said Bassam Barabandi, a former Syrian diplomat who is now political adviser to the opposition High Negotiations Committee. “They want to show themselves to be the superpower in the region, to broker a deal but, at the same time, they are bombing and killing everyone left in Aleppo.\n“The Russians would prefer to have a ceasefire, to help their relations with Turkey and show they are interested in peace, but the regime and the Iranians – they don’t care. They want to take all of Aleppo. For the Russians, failing to achieve a ceasefire in Aleppo will show just how weak they are.”\nEast Aleppo has been under siege for 150 days and has suffered increasingly heavy bombardment for several months. About 200,000 people are thought to be trapped there, without any functioning hospitals and with medical and food supplies exhausted. \nAfter a ground offensive in the past week led by Lebanese Hezbollah units and Iranian-led Shia militias, the rebels lost 40% of their territory in the city. There are now thought to be up to 8,000 rebel fighters left, of whom an estimated 100 to 400 are part of the extremist Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, formerly known as the al-Qaida-aligned Nusra Front. \nRanda Slim, an analyst at the Middle East Institute who has been involved in back-channel dialogue in the region on Syria, said the Russian proposals in Ankara did not appear to offer anything new.\n“The issue has always been that these humanitarian corridors go through government territory, and the four corridors the Russians are talking about still go through government territory, and we have heard now of hundreds of people being taken at checkpoints,” Slim said. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  A Syrian boy queues for food at a shelter in the government-controlled Jibreen area of Aleppo. Photograph: Omar Sanadiki/Reuters\n\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross said on Thursday it had asked Damascus for access to the sites where Aleppo residents were being screened and detained as they fled the city.\n“We are of course trying to get access to these screening facilities and screening centres. In Syria, we also have access to a number of places of detention,” Dominik Stillhart, the ICRC director of operations told Reuters. “But the situation is, for the time being, extremely confusing. It is not easy for our teams to have access to these centres.”\nSlim said that if the rebels decided to fight to the death, south-east Aleppo could perhaps hold out for some time as its defenders had constructed a network of tunnels and fortifications. \nBut the regime side now believes the crushing of the enclave’s resistance will be completed within weeks. Reuters quoted a senior official in the pro-regime alliance as saying that the current war aim was to drive all rebels out of Aleppo before Donald Trump took office as US president.\n\n"

        "text": "\nThe day before the Paris carnage, two suicide bombers killed at least 40 people in a Shia district of Beirut. The week after, two suicide bombings in Nigeria killed 49 people. Faced with such atrocities, we can often do little but reach for adjectives such as “barbarous”, “depraved” – even “evil”. But what is it that makes people act in such depraved, evil ways?\n“The sad truth,” Hannah Arendt wrote in The Life of the Mind, “is that most evil is done by people who never make up their minds to be good or evil.” Marc Sageman, once a CIA case officer in Afghanistan, now an academic and counter-terrorism consultant, makes a similar point about today’s jihadis. “It’s comforting to believe that these guys are different from us, because what they do is so evil,” he argues. “Unfortunately, they aren’t that different.”\nBut jihadis are different. They are, after all, jihadis. How are people “who aren’t that different” from you and me able to commit the most brutal of mass murders?\nWhen we talk of an act as depraved or evil, we are not merely describing something particularly abhorrent. We are making a claim about the boundaries of morality itself.\nPeople often disagree about the most fundamental of moral issues. Some, for instance, view torture as always wrong; others think it acceptable to obtain vital information. Each may view the other as immoral. Yet they are likely to agree that both are debating questions of right and wrong.\nIf someone were to say, however, that “Torturing people is an unalloyed good”, few would see him as making a moral argument at all. And most people would call such a claim “evil”.\nEvil, in other words, is not simply about defining an act as being particularly wicked. It is also about defining the space within which we can have a meaningful debate about good and bad, virtue and wickedness.\nWhat makes the actions of jihadis so inexplicable is that they seem to take place beyond the moral universe most of us inhabit. So, what is it that leads people “who aren’t that different” to cross the normal boundaries of morality?\nPeople have, of course, always committed depraved and evil acts, but simply to say “It has always happened” does not explain what is distinctive about contemporary terrorism. Nor does it address perhaps the most incendiary question today: why do Islamist groups in particular seem so much more sadistic, even evil?\n\n\n\n\n \n\nMisguided military interventions have helped destroy civil society, so hollowing out the space for Islamists\n\n\nFor some the answer lies with Islam itself. The Qur’an, they argue, is particularly violent; Muslims are more given to literal readings of their holy book – and hence more willing to commit acts of savagery.\nIslam is clearly an important factor. Those – including David Cameron and Barack Obama – who insist that jihadis are not “real” Muslims miss the point. The fact that Isis supporters practise their religion in a way that horrifies most liberals does not make it any less Islamic.\nYet, if the insistence that jihadism is disconnected from Islam makes little sense, so does the claim that Islam alone can explain why jihadis act so unconscionably. The vast majority of Muslims abhor the actions of Isis, and would find their actions morally inexplicable. And from Buddhist monks in Myanmar organising anti-Muslim pogroms to Dylann Roof shooting dead black worshippers in a Charleston church, inhumanity is widespread in the non-Muslim world too.\nThere appears, nevertheless, to be something especially potent about Islam in fomenting terror and persecution. Contemporary radical Islam is the religious form through which a particular kind of barbarous rage expresses itself.\nSo, to understand why jihadis have been drawn into a moral universe that allows them to celebrate inhuman acts, we have to understand why political rage against the West takes such nihilistic, barbaric forms, and why radical Islam has become the primary vehicle for such rage.\nJihadis view themselves as warriors against western imperialism. Yet few anti-imperialists of previous generations would recognise jihadis as ideological kin.\nThere is a long history of popular struggles against colonialism and empire. While such movements often used violent means to pursue their ends, they were rarely “anti-western” in any existential sense. Rather they worked within a universalist moral framework that stressed freedom and emancipation for all humanity.\nOver the past few decades these anti-imperialist traditions have unravelled. The new movements that have emerged in their place are often rooted in religious or ethnic identity, and are sectarian or separatist in form. This shift is linked to the wider decline of progressive social movements, the loss of faith in universalist values, and the replacement of ideological politics with the politics of identity. Moral norms have increasingly become tribal rather than universal. Political struggle for a better world has given way to inchoate identity-driven rage.\nWhy has radical Islam become the lightning rod for such rage? In part because of the conditions that have allowed Islamism to flourish; and in part because of the nature of fundamentalist faith in an age in which political ideals have eroded. The failure of secular regimes in Muslim-majority countries, and their degeneration into brutal authoritarianism, has led many to associate secularism with repression, giving greater credibility to Islamist opposition. The cynicism of the west in backing authoritarian regimes when it suited them has inflamed anti-western passions. Misguided military interventions have helped destroy civil society, so hollowing out the space for Islamists to flourish, while also exacerbating hostility towards the west.\nIt’s not just in Muslim countries that sectarian opposition movements have arisen in opposition to authoritarian rule. But in non-Muslim countries, from Myanmar to the Democratic Republic of Congo, such sectarianism rarely has purchase beyond their borders. The global character of Islam has transformed the sectarian movements into a worldwide phenomenon.\nIf the actions of local rulers and the consequences of western action have helped create one kind of void that Islamism has filled, the retreat of progressive politics has created another.\nThe demise of traditional opposition movements has led many to look for alternative forms of struggle, and created a yearning for God-given moral lines. Islamism – with its demand for a struggle to establish an alternative system governed by divinely sanctioned rules – has for some filled the void. The illusion of divine sanction has allowed jihadis to justify their acts, however grotesque they may be.\nJihadis imagine that they are waging war against the west. But the west has become in their eyes, not a set of specific nations responsible for specific acts, but an almost mythical, all-encompassing monster, the modern version of the chimera or basilisk, the source of all manner of horror and dread. And against such a monster, almost any act becomes acceptable.\nShorn of the moral framework that once guided anti-imperialists, shaped by black-and-white values that in their mind possess divine approval, driven by a sense of rage about non-Muslims and a belief in an existential struggle between Islam and the west, jihadis have come to inhabit a different moral universe, in which they are to commit the most inhuman of acts and view them as righteous.\nNone of this is to “excuse” jihadis, or their actions. It is, however, to suggest that the “evil” expressed in the kind of terror visited in recent days on Paris, Beirut, Nigeria and Mali is not merely some eternal aspect of human nature, but very much the product of our times.\n"

        "text": "\nThe UN’s humanitarian chief has warned that eastern Aleppo was being turned into “one giant graveyard” as the rebel-held area was being overrun by Syrian regime and Russian forces.\nStephen O’Brien told an emergency session of the UN security council that since Saturday 25,000 people had been forced from their homes in eastern Aleppo, more than half of them children, as the government offensive stormed into opposition districts. \n\n\n\n\nThe Guardian view on Aleppo: the west’s grim failure | Editorial\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe council sat as what is left of the rebel enclave came under another day of intense bombing, with video footage showing the bodies of dead children being carried off the streets. The UN envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, said nearly 40% of the opposition area had been captured by government forces, cutting the enclave in two.\nO’Brien said that those trying to flee the fighting faced new dangers, as rebel factions sought to stop them leaving, or they were caught in the crossfire and then faced being seized and “disappeared” at government checkpoints. \n“For the sake of humanity, we call on, we plead, with the parties, and those with influence, to do everything in their power to protect civilians and enable access to the besieged part of eastern Aleppo before it becomes one giant graveyard,” O’Brien said. \nThe Russian ambassador to the UN, Vitaly Churkin, rejected calls for an end to the offensive, which is being spearheaded on the ground by Lebanese Hezbollah and Iranian-led units, with Russian air support. \nChurkin said Russia shared concern for the fate of the civilian population but argued their plight would not be eased by ceasing “counter-terrorist operations” against “bandits” that the UK and France had “coddled and fuelled”. He called the White Helmet civil defence organisation, which digs people out of bombed buildings, a “pseudo-humanitarian” group, and said UN resolutions calling for an end to the bloodshed were “a pointless tactic”. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Stephen OBrien, under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief, urged parties to the conflict to protect civilians ‘for the sake of humanity’. Photograph: UN Photo/Manuel Elias/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\nMatthew Rycroft, the UK ambassador to the UN, pointed to UN figures that a million people are now living under siege across Syria, half of them children.\n“Russia has vetoed time and again to prevent the security council from finding the unity necessary to end this war. And so I ask again Mr President, what will it take?” he said. \n“Without a change in policy, without a change of heart, that’s exactly what this is – the slow, painful, bitter execution of a million Syrians, cut off from aid convoys, cut off from the world,” he said.\nThe French envoy, François Delattre, said the crushing of eastern Aleppo was not just a humanitarian calamity but also a strategic mistake.\n“What is happening in Aleppo will only fuel chaos and terrorism. Not only is it not a way in our view to combat terrorism, but it is a mechanic way, automatic way, to fuel radicalisation and terrorism,” Delattre said. \nUnicef’s regional director, Geert Cappelaere, said six million children in Syria were in need of humanitarian assistance, of which, two million were in hard-to-reach areas and 500,000 were living under siege. \n“Some of these children have been living under siege for two years,” Cappelaere said. \n\n\n\n\n'I need peace': seven-year-old Bana tweets her life in besieged Aleppo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“I would like us all to pause for a moment and imagine life through the eyes of a child trapped in that tragic situation. As a boy or girl in Aleppo today, where do you find comfort and hope, amidst the bombs?” he asked the council. “Determined to learn, you attend school whenever your parents allow you to leave the house, but you do not know any more if you will ever come back. It is hard for you as a child to focus because it is cold and you don’t sleep well, haunted by nightmares and hunger.”\nO’Brien raised the alarm over the plight of civilians forced out of eastern Aleppo by the fighting, who first had to cross frontlines and then brave government checkpoints. \n“As we have seen before, across Syria and throughout the conflict, men, women and children, have been routinely arrested at government-controlled checkpoints, before being transferred to one of dozens of official or secret government-run detention facilities,” he said. “They are often held incommunicado and indefinitely, facing the risk of being subjected to torture and ill-treatment, extrajudicial killings or being disappeared.” \n"

        "text": "\nRebel fighters meeting the Syrian government for the first time in the country’s bloody six-year civil war appear to have rejected a plan for Iran to play a role in monitoring the ceasefire.\nThe negotiations sponsored by Russia, Iran and Turkey in the Kazakh capital, Astana, are the latest attempt to end the war and seen as a test of Moscow’s influence in the Middle East.\nThe proposal for a trilateral ceasefire commission, overseen jointly by the talks’ sponsors, is the most specific new measure set out in a draft communique the Russians hope to release on Tuesday, the second and closing day of the talks. It was not clear if the monitoring body could go ahead without Iranian involvement.\nThe Syrian fighting groups believe militia linked to Iran, such as Lebanon’s Hezbollah, are – along with Bashar al-Assad’s government – systematically breaching the ceasefire agreed on 29 December. The Syrian fighters believe Iran, as perpetrators of innumerable ceasefire breaches, cannot credibly monitor or enforce a ceasefire.\nThe debate is also raising questions whether Russia is willing in its new role as mediator in the Middle East to compromise after helping the Syrian government to victories over the rebels, something that its new ally Turkey has been urging it do.\nThe two sides began the talks trading insults after the rebels refused to negotiate face to face in the first session and the representative for Assad’s government described remarks by his opposite number as insolent.\nBashar al-Jaafari, the leader of the Assad delegation and the Syrian ambassador to the UN, claimed the leader of the Syrian rebel delegation, Mohammed Alloush, was not serious and had acted in a way “removed from diplomacy” after he called for the Syrian president to go.\nAlloush said the rebels were prepared to keep fighting if no deal was possible, and while a political solution to the civil war was the rebels’ preferred choice, it was not the only one. “We came here to reinforce the ceasefire as the first phase of this process,” he said. “We will not proceed to the next phases until this actually happens on the ground.” He described the Syrian government as a “terrorist entity”. \nAs well as the ceasefire commission proposal, the leaked draft communique also broadly supports the existing UN talks process and calls for joint action to defeat Islamic State and other terrorist groups in Syria.\nFor the first time in Syrian peace talks, the opposition delegation has been drawn from the armed rebel groups rather than their political representatives. The talks are designed to build on the fragile ceasefire that came into force in late December after the fall of the rebel stronghold of east Aleppo.\nAlloush said in his opening remarks that the presence of Iranian-sponsored militias alongside regular Syrian government troops made peace more difficult to achieve, and called for them to leave the country. He also called for the release of prisoners from government jails, saying 13,000 women were being held arbitrarily. \nAlloush insisted the political process would begin with the departure of Assad, Iran, and their militias – a set of demands that put the opposition at loggerheads with the regime.\nA rebel spokesman said the first negotiation session was not held face to face because of the regime’s continued bombardment and attacks on an area near Damascus.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Mohammed Alloush (centre), the head of Syrian opposition delegation. Photograph: Sergei Grits/AP\n\n\nThe UN special envoy, Staffan de Mistura, who is in Astana, said he hoped the talks would lead to UN-led negotiations based on security council resolutions. De Mistura, who is due to hold UN talks on 8 February in Geneva, spent much of last year involved in lengthy and ultimately unsuccessful talks on how to enforce ceasefires, including the monitoring and enforcement mechanisms in the event of violations. \nAdjudicating on ceasefire violations is made more complex by the fact that some rebels fight alongside groups not party to the ceasefire, giving Russia and Syria an alibi to continue with a wider bombardment.\nRussia believes the Astana talks could prove more fruitful than previous efforts, partly because Barack Obama’s administration is not involved, but also because the opposition has been weakened by defeat in Aleppo and because Turkey, once a hardline opponent of Assad, has recognised that his departure from office is no longer a precondition for political talks starting.\nAt the opening of the first session, attended by all the delegations, the Kazakh foreign minister, Kairat Abdrakhmanov, said the talks were designed to complement and not supplant the UN talks process.\nHossein Jaberi Ansari, the head of the Iranian delegation, said: “We have to maintain the unity and independence of Syria and only the Syrian people have the right to decide their own future.” \nHis remarks were designed to underscore Iran’s commitment to keeping Assad in power.\nThe regime’s objectives include reaching “common ground” with other participants, the Syrian state news agency Sana quoted Jaafari as saying. \nA source close to the regime representatives said: “The government delegation took part in the Astana meeting on the basis that the agenda would include reinforcing the ceasefire and discussing the principles of a political solution.”\nThe Astana talks are a major test of Russian influence in the Middle East, including its new partnership with Turkey. The rapprochement, which saw Russia and Turkey conduct their first joint airstrikes against Isis targets in Syria last week, was brought about in part by the US refusal to distance itself from Syrian Kurds, as demanded by Ankara. \nDonald Trump’s administration has yet to develop a detailed Syrian policy, but it is likely to focus on the defeat of Isis, rather than the removal of Assad.\n"

        "text": "\nThere have been some flickers of hope from Syrian peace talks taking place in Astana this week. The negotiations led by Russia, Iran and Turkey may yet pave the way to a sustainable ceasefire deal, but even this will not erase the fact that the international community’s record on Syria is a bloody and shameful one.\nNearly six years after peaceful protesters took to the streets of Damascus, more than 300,000 people have been killed and millions displaced by a war that has seen international norms violated, chemical weapons deployed against civilians, and the barbaric tactics of siege and starvation used by a state against its own citizens.\nLate last year,  I read a letter from the White Helmets, Syria’s brave volunteer rescue force, to the British parliament. The letter was written during the Russia-backed siege on then rebel-held Aleppo, and read: “We cannot believe that one of the world’s most powerful countries, in the full glare of the media, will allow 279,000 people to be starved and bombed to death.” But stand by we did. Day after day on our TV screens, we watched as terrified civilians were hounded into smaller and smaller zones in the centre of old Aleppo.\n\n\n\n\nJo Cox report urges UK not to shy away from overseas intervention\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe failed to act to protect civilians in Aleppo, but that should not end the debate about what we can do for Syria. There are still thousands of civilians living in besieged cities and towns across the country, many under attack not just from Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad but also from proscribed terrorist organisations such as Islamic State and Hezbollah. These terrorists will not respect any ceasefire: the men, women and children suffering at their hands need our help. A comprehensive UK strategy to protect civilians in Syria, including by facilitating urgent aid delivery, is sorely needed.\nThe UN doctrine of the Responsibility to Protect, which the UK championed and signed up to in 2005, says that if a government is manifestly failing to protect its own people, other states should do all they can – including using military force when it is the only option – to prevent mass atrocities. Far from honouring the resolution, the UK has stood transfixed and impotent in the face of the greatest crime of our century. By failing to act to prevent Assad’s brutality, Britain – along with the US and other liberal western nations – left the way clear for Russia to take the initiative.\nReluctance to act in Syria may have been understandable in the context of our recent involvement in the Middle East but it has had dire consequences both for people in Syria and for international law, which is now hanging by a thread. Russia’s actions and their shameful sabotaging of the UN process have rewritten the rules of conflict and threaten the entire international order. It is time to reassert our values, starting with the belief that the international community must honour the commitment made in 2005 to protect civilians.\nThis is the argument made by a report launched today at Policy Exchange which looks at the reasons for and consequences of Britain’s retreat to kneejerk anti-interventionism. The report was started by my friend Jo Cox, before she died, in partnership with Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat.\nIt was a privilege to be asked to help finish the report, and to contribute to Jo’s legacy. In the piece, Tom and I argue that the willingness to act to prevent mass atrocities – and, by extension, to intervene militarily in exceptional circumstances – is an essential part of Britain’s role in the world. We urge our fellow parliamentarians, and the public, to look beyond Iraq and Afghanistan to the wider lessons of intervention.\nThese include times where we intervened successfully – such as Sierra Leone and Kosovo – and prevented mass atrocities; as well as instances – such as Bosnia, Darfur, and Rwanda – where our collective failure to act had disastrous consequences.\n\n\n\n\nUntil a ceasefire covers all rebel groups, war will rage on in Syria | Ranj Alaaldin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Britain embarks on the process of forging a new role outside the EU, our international obligations must be at the heart of our thinking. It is dangerous to believe we can ignore fundamental challenges facing our friends and allies. Much as we may not want to confront it, the deteriorating international environment means we are likely to face more calls for the UK to take a lead. If Theresa May is serious about her ambition for a “Global Britain” then she should be using her meeting with Donald Trump this week to press the case for greater engagement in Syria and make it clear that the UK stands ready to do what is necessary to protect civilians.\nIn the wake of Aleppo, and with daunting challenges ahead, we must realise that both action and inaction have consequences. As Jo Cox always argued, we cannot stand by in the face of war crimes, crimes against humanity, or genocide. It is not in Britain’s national interest, nor in the interests of the weakest and most vulnerable in the world.\n"

An Australian was among the Hezbollah agents suspected of involvement.\nUnclassified advice from the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (Asio) found there was “no indication” the branch’s activities had changed since the last review in 2012.\nIts founder, Imad Mughniyeh, was killed by a car bomb in Damascus in 2008, an attack widely attributed to the Israeli secret service.\nHezbollah, formed with Iranian support in southern Lebanon in 1982 after an Israeli invasion, has deep roots in Lebanese society and active political and social service branches.\nAsio said the ESO was “very distinct” from these other branches, and given the “degree of legitimacy” Hezbollah enjoyed in Lebanon, it was important not to proscribe the entire organisation.\nHezbollah’s place in western strategic calculations has been complicated more recently by its role fighting Islamic State in Syria.\nAn annual US security report in March excluded Hezbollah and Iran from a list of terrorism threats to US interests for the first time in years. This was seen as a sop to their cooperation against Isis and a sign of warming relations between Washington and Tehran.\nHowever, both the US and Britain continue to list the ESO as a terrorist organisation.\n"

        "text": "\nAs Iran and world powers reached their nuclear agreement in Vienna, the website of supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei announced a new publication, the Line of Hezbollah, which it said would “allow the revolutionary community to benefit directly from the ideas and declarations of the supreme leader on...current political, social, and economic events”.\nSo far there have been 12 editions of the Line of Hezbollah, which differs from www.khamenei.ir in offering analyses of the leader’s speeches and articles rather than simply presenting them. And if Khamenei’s website is aimed at all Iranians as well as the foreign media, the Line of Hezbollah is directed squarely at the leader’s committed supporters, sometimes known as “Hezbollahis” and often members of the volunteer Basij militia. \nThis is the first time such a publication has appeared in the 26 years Khamenei has been leader. There is no coincidence between its emergence and the nuclear agreement. Some fundamentalists have expressed concern over a possible wider thaw in relations with the United States, and Khamenei’s strategy appears to be to mollify their worries by emphasising he will not allow undue concessions.\n\n\n\n‘Satan’s confessions’\n\n\n“The Rouhani government’s agreement with the west would not have been possible without Khamenei’s permission,” a member of the Islamic Iran Participation Front, the reformist party suspended since 2009, told Tehran Bureau. “Still, it appears that he is using this new publication to elucidate his positions and give his supporters some peace of mind that his approach to diplomatic, domestic and cultural issues will not soften in the aftermath of this deal.”\nThe first issue explained leader’s apparent lack of comment following the announcement of the nuclear deal in Vienna: “Some expected the leader to explicitly express his support or disapproval of the development, whereas in fact the legal and workable path of this deal has yet to be made clear... The agreement must be completely assessed and the kinks must be ‘hammered out’, so to speak, so as to preclude any possible abuses or cheating on behalf of the other parties ...\n\n\n\n‘Key word’ will signal a critical word or phrase uttered by Ayatollah Khamenei, keeping diehard followers on message\n\n\n“Imam [Ruhollah] Khomeini [leader of the 1979 Revolution] and Ayatollah Khamenei have always favoured legal processes and benefited from collective wisdom on matters of national importance…the leader’s record of behaviour in this regard shows that, in this instance, it was correct neither to be starry-eyed nor to declare the death of the Islamic Republic.”\nIn the sixth edition is a piece on a controversial film by Majid Majidi on the life of the prophet Muhammad, a reaction to comments by the British foreign secretary on relations between Iran and Israel, and an exposition of Khamenei’s views on the need for Iranians to have more children. \n\n\n\n\nRare portrayal of Muhammad’s youth in upcoming Iranian film\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA column headlined “Israel will disappear” refutes Philip Hammond’s remark that Iran’s position on Israel had “changed a little”. It quotes extensively from Khamenei’s speeches since 1990: “They have brought evil people from all around the world and fabricated a nation called Israel…the Zionist regime is an imposed regime, brought about by force…the struggle against Zionism and its supporters is one of the bases of the Islamic Republic of Iran’s political strategy.”\nA reformist journalist told Tehran Bureau she had no doubt the Line of Hezbollah should be considered Khamenei’s official publication: “He’s been the supreme leader for 26 years, and this is the first time he’s allowed an analytical publication like this to be released with his name attached to it.”\nThe Line of Hezbollah also marks a shift in the status of the conservative newspaper Kayhan, sometimes considered Khamenei’s unofficial mouthpiece. Editor Hossein Shariatmadari, who is appointed by the leader, has launched fierce attacks against the Rouhani administration and the Iranian negotiating team, allegedly for making concessions to the west. But with the emergence of the Line of Hezbollah, it will be far harder for any publication, including Kayhan, to convey an impression it speaks for the leader. \nA Basij member at Tehran’s Science and Technology University told Tehran Bureau he expected great interest among Basij students: “I imagine that with the start of the new [academic] year, the Line of Hezbollah will break previous distribution records. In any case the publication has the ayatollah’s stamp on it, and in a way he is responding to a demand from his young supporters to have a publication endorsed by him.”\nQasem, a Basij member in the North Afsariyeh district of south Tehran, explained how Basij bases located in mosques were spreading the word: “We’ll print copies of the Line of Hezbollah as soon as it’s released, and anyone who comes to the mosque for prayers will receive a copy if they wish. We’ll make it available in stores and during night prayers as well. Our Basiji sisters will also take it to distribute to women.”\nQasem said the Line of Hezbollah would allow Khamenei’s supporters unfiltered access to his views: “Basijis love Ayatollah Khamenei. Whenever he appears at Friday prayers everyone goes to show their support. We watch his speeches on television. Having said this, many of us are busy working and we don’t have time to hear the entirety of his speeches and remarks on the radio or television; we have to gather it all from websites and newspapers, and these sources have their own biases...This publication will be like a light in the darkness; it will show us the proper path.”\nIn north Tehran the reaction is different. A director at the Imam Sajjad Mosque in Niavaran told Tehran Bureau that distribution of the Line of Hezbollah was low. “It’s enough for us that people show up to pray and then go home,” he said. “It doesn’t really work when we try to politicise the atmosphere here.”\n\n\n\n\nIran's must-follow Instagram accounts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Line of Hezbollah also has an active presence on social media, particularly Instagram, where it had 8,152 followers after just 31 posts in six weeks. The small number of comments - usually between ten and 20 for each post – suggests it has yet to become a popular forum for discussion.\nIn addition to appearing on Khamenei’s site, the Line of Hezbollah is featured on most fundamentalist and moderate news services, websites, and newspapers, including Bulletin News, Mashreq News, Fars News, Mehr News, Keyhan, Vatan-e Emruz. While the reformist newspaper Shargh did report the launch, other reformist papers, such as Etemad and Qanoon, have shown little interest.\n"

The trouble is, in a civil war, with each side determined to win, the scope for negotiation isn’t great. She refers to the “Assad regime”, meaning the Syrian government, supported by the great majority of the country’s Shia Muslims, Alawites, Druze, and four types of Christians – the plural society that in happier times made Syria what it was. If Bashar al-Assad dropped dead tomorrow, would the situation significantly change? Would the Saudis stop assisting the rebels, or the Iranians the government? More importantly, would the Isis menace suddenly dissolve?\nAnd, in her anxiety to clobber the Russians, she failed to mention the Syrian army’s signal victory (with Russian help) in recapturing Palmyra, and demonstrating that Isis isn’t invincible.Robin Milner-GullandWashington, West Sussex\n• Natalie Nougayrède was right in asserting the need to avert a human catastrophe in Aleppo. Rwanda and Srebrenica remain poignant reminders of the ineptitude of the global community to diminish racial polarisation.\nThe world has paid a heavy price for the lack of vision in the Middle East. Jordan has received more than 1.5 million Syrian refugees. This is bound to sap its health, security, defence and educational resources. We cannot afford to lose credible allies in the vanguard of fighting international terrorism and offering safe havens for the most vulnerable. Dr Munjed Farid Al QutobLondon\n• As you observe (Editorial, 30 July), it doesn’t help that western attention is focused on terrorism in Europe and the US electoral campaign, and this must point to the urgent need for news media to shift that focus to the unfolding disaster in Syria in order to promote the critically important mobilisation of global public opinion to which you refer.

        "text": "\nTurkey’s main border crossings with north-west Syria remain closed for a second day as tens of thousands of refugees flee a Russian bombardment and a ground offensive by pro-government groups that has all but besieged Aleppo.\nAid agencies in southern Turkey were scrambling to deliver food and shelter to whole communities that had fled the most sustained attack of the five-year war, with some arrivals claiming their towns and villages had been decimated by indiscriminate bombing.\n\n\n\n\nThe Guardian view on the war in south-eastern Turkey: a tragedy and a danger | Editorial\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe United Nations estimated that 20,000 people had gathered at the Bab al-Salam border crossing. Most are believed to be among the poorest residents of northern Syria, who had remained behind throughout a conflict that had emptied out the countryside between Aleppo and the border, and whittled away the rebel-held east of the city itself. \nThe regime push marks one of the most decisive phases of the war, and comes after three years of setbacks in the north, in which most of Aleppo and Idlib provinces had fallen from the grasp of Damascus.\n\nMap of Syria\n\nFew residents had remained in Aleppo before the latest push, which coincided with now-stalled peace talks in Geneva between Syrian regime officials and members of the opposition. Rebel forces still in east Aleppo said the country’s largest city had been without power, fuel, water and food for several weeks. \nA ground assault led by Hezbollah and Shia militia groups has effectively laid siege to the city, which had been a stronghold of the opposition presence in northern Syria since July 2012. Rebel groups in the area, among them the al-Qaida-linked Jabhat al-Nusra, conceded that only several kilometres stood between pro-Assad forces on either side and that the gap was likely to be closed over the weekend.\n“The Russian airplanes haven’t stopped,” said Syrian activist Bahaa al-Halabi. “Every minute, there is an airstrike. The Russian airplanes are flying five or six planes together. So far, they have hit more than three local markets and caused a lot of civilian casualties. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Syrians fleeing the northern city of Aleppo wait in Bab al-Salam border crossing with Turkey. Photograph: Bulent Kilic/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\n“People have been fleeing Aleppo since last week and heading to the Turkish borders but the Turks are not allowing them to enter. They have been sleeping in the fields without any protection in this cold weather. \n“They do not dare to cross to the areas controlled by the regime because they know they will be killed straight away. Nothing is safe now, Aleppo the city and the countryside are destroyed and the Shia militias of Hezbollah, Abu Fadhl al-Abas and the Iranian militias are fighting at the borders of the city.”\nA second Syrian activist at the Bab al-Salam crossing, Yousef Haj Ali, said: “There are huge numbers of refugees here. They have escaped a brutal war against them. Azaz has been hit throughout the day by planes and they have nowhere to hide.”\n\n\n\n\nSyrian rebels losing grip on Aleppo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIranian news agencies said on Friday that a brigadier general and six members of its Basiji forces had been killed in the fighting. Hezbollah, which has played a lead role in the assault, which first broke a siege of two Shia villages, has not released casualty figures. However, residents of the group’s stronghold of Dahiyeh in south Beirut said at least four of its members had died.\nTurkey has taken in more than 2.5 million Syrian refugees throughout the conflict and allowed hundreds of thousands more to cross its borders, many of whom have travelled to Europe via overland routes or deadly crossings of the Mediterranean Sea. Of those who remain in Turkey, many are housed in camps near the border crossings. However, over the past year, only urgent medical cases and some people with pre-arranged family visits have been allowed to enter Turkey.\nSherif Elsayed-Ali, deputy director of global issues at Amnesty International, said: “Turkey … must not close its doors to people in desperate need of safety.\n“These people have fled airstrikes and heavy fighting; they are likely to be traumatised and exhausted. Turkey must allow them to enter its territory and the international community must do all it can to ensure adequate support is given to the country.”\nMohammed al-Yousef, a refugee from Raytan, which fell on Thursday to pro-regime forces, said every hospital in the north had been damaged or destroyed by warplanes. The UN estimated that 13 hospitals had been destroyed in January.\nAccess to medical care was now a critical issue for new arrivals, Yousef said. “It’s just as important to get treated as it is to get food and water.”\nRussia’s stated goal in Syria had been to to attack Islamic State, which controls much of eastern Syria, and has a smaller presence in parts of the centre of the country. Isis forces have not had a significant presence in the north-west since last February, when opposition groups ousted them after a six-week battle.\nThe war, which started as a civilian uprising against the rule of Bashar al-Assad, has destroyed large parts of the country’s towns and cities, forced 6.5 million to flee and left millions more to fend for themselves amid widespread bombardment and starvation sieges.\nOpposition forces, which initially unified under the banner of the Free Syrian Army, have splintered and realigned throughout the war into a dizzying array of groups. Some have Islamist leanings, others are global jihadis, and yet more are non-ideological units who claim to be fighting to re-orientate power within Syria’s borders.\nRegime forces have been significantly boosted throughout the war by Shia militias, led by Hezbollah, and the Abl al-Fadil al-Abbas brigades from Iraq. More recently, they have been joined by Shias recruited from Afghanistan. All have been co-ordinated by Iran. \nDespite the support, the military had been unable to manoeuvre around Aleppo in two prior attempts to oust the rebels. Russian air assaults over the past fortnight, as well as the direct involvement of some Iranian forces, have been decisive in the current advances.\nNato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said on Friday that the Russian strikes were “undermining efforts to find a political solution to the conflict”. \n"

        "text": "\nA Syrian military academy in the heart of Aleppo made for a bold, even reckless target for opposition forces trying to break a devastating siege, but the rebels gambled on a double advantage: surprise and suicide bombers.\nSoon the rebels were sharing pictures of abandoned artillery and a smashed portrait of President Bashar al-Assad on Twitter, flaunted as triumphant proof that the army was routed and opposition forces were within a few hundred metres of their besieged comrades.\nHours later, the people of east Aleppo were dancing in the street, as rebels and activists confirmed that the month-long siege of the area had been broken. The fate of the opposition-held city was back in play. “Morale is very high now,” said activist and poet Mahmoud Rashwani, who had been living largely underground to avoid airstrikes, eking out his supplies of canned food.\nThe victory is a fragile one. The area is still a conflict zone and it may be some time before a secure corridor for food and medical supplies can be set up, and the regime has called in reinforcements.\n“We expect revenge bombing by the regime, including, possibly, chemical weapons,” said Zaher Sahloul, a Syrian-American doctor who coordinates medical aid in the city.\nStill, for the rebels, it has been a remarkable triumph against the odds. After months of retreat under pressure from government forces and Russian airstrikes, they have not only broken the siege, but overrun a key base the regime had used to enforce it and apparently taken possession of a large cache of weapons and artillery.\nDays earlier, the area’s future had appeared grimly settled, its civilian population facing slow weeks of deprivation and fear, as aid groups warned of a humanitarian catastrophe.\nMore than a quarter of a million people were hemmed into the battered remains of streets by the guns of Assad’s conscripts, elite Iranian troops and a spectrum of Shia militias, patrolled from above by Russian planes. The rebels had fewer men, fewer weapons and, most crucially, no air force.\nThe opposition groups called a temporary truce to their own disputes, summoned hundreds of their most battle-hardened troops away from other fronts, and used tunnel bombs and suicide attackers to hit the military base to try to set a counter-siege of western Aleppo.\nBoth sides are throwing everything they can at the four-year battle for the city – a fight that has come to define the Syrian civil war, because each believes the fate of Aleppo will decide the outcome of the conflict.\n“This battle’s results exceed simply opening the road for besieged people; it will overturn the balance of the struggle in the Levant,” said Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, leader of the powerful Jabhat al-Nusra faction that, until last month, was the official al- Qaida franchise in Syria.\nLast month, the faction severed those ties, changed its name to Jabhat Fateh al-Sham and renounced international jihad, although observers said there was little sign of a parallel shift in ideology. Instead, experts reckoned the move was probably aimed at getting it off US airstrike target lists and easing coalitions with other factions.\nThat rebranding put the group in a strong position to capitalise on last week’s campaign, particularly if it can consolidate a victory that casts it as a champion of Aleppo’s battered civilians.\n“We urge our people in Aleppo to remain steadfast,” Jolani added in the audio recording released on Friday. “The mujahideen will not fail you.”\nThe contrast with western powers, which condemned the siege but said they were powerless to stop it, is unlikely to be lost on Syrians, analysts warned.\n“The world abandoned Aleppo; the jihadis came to the rescue. Al-Qaida’s rebranding could hardly have asked for more,” analyst Kyle Orton, from the Henry Jackson Society, said on Twitter.\nAleppo is both strategically and symbolically important. Damascus may be the capital but, before fighting broke out, the northern city was the most populous, the economic powerhouse – a diverse, vibrant cultural hub with a history stretching back millennia.\nIt was late to join the uprising against Assad, producing neither large-scale protests nor the bloody violence that swept through other cities in the first year of the civil war but, since the opposition stormed it in 2012, it has been a crucial battleground.\nAleppo was divided almost immediately into government- and rebel-controlled areas, along lines that have remained mostly static ever since: a stalemate unmoved by repeated and often ruthless attempts to dislodge the other side.\nThe years of bloody fighting have made it a symbol of Syria’s suffering, encapsulating in one place the bravery of its civilians and the terrible complexity of a war that, even before the rise of Islamic State, has set disturbingly extreme opposition groups against an ever more brutal government.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Fighters from the former Nusra – the groups has been renamed Fateh al-Sham but experts fear their ideology won’t change. Photograph: Omar Haj Kadour/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\nThe eastern half of the city has held out, despite an unforgiving aerial campaign by the Assad regime, whose barrel bombs have reduced much of it to ruins. Rebels have deployed “hell cannons” – crude artillery using gas cylinders – that have also been called indiscriminate.\nAleppo is now the last major urban centre where the rebels have a foothold, and success in breaking the siege would carry great psychological weight, reversing the momentum of months of setbacks brought about by an intense Russian air campaign in support of Assad.\nMoscow intervened last year at a precarious time for Assad, who had lost all of Idlib province to a concerted rebel offensive. It was the first time a large coalition of opposition fighters had come together to fight the government and analysts spoke plausibly of Aleppo’s fall to the opposition.\nThe Kremlin’s campaign ended such hopes, pummelling the rebels, undoing their advances and leaving Assad secure in his strongholds. He, rather than opposition fighters, focused on the push for Aleppo, which culminated at the start of July in a long-feared siege.\nLess than a month after being cut off, life in Aleppo has already slowed to a near halt. Markets are empty, schools have closed, hospitals and orphanages moved underground. Residents are woken by the first airstrikes of the day.\nThose who chose to stay in Aleppo have stockpiled provisions in the knowledge that the regime and its backers would try to cut them off.\nThe Syrian army has honed the use of siege warfare to bring cities to their knees and then take them under government control – among them Homs, the birthplace and once the capital of the revolution, which opposition fighters abandoned last year.\nSieges allow Assad to avoid sending a depleted and demoralised Syrian army into close combat with the more highly motivated opposition forces. The Syrian military is down to as little as a third of its prewar strength and reliant on ground forces from Iran’s revolutionary guards, Hezbollah and a patchwork of other regional militias.\nLike the opposition, Assad and his supporters are convinced that taking Aleppo will effectively end the civil war, breaking the morale of the opposition and condemning it to a marginal existence as a rural insurgency that can no longer claim to speak for large sections of Syrian society. Bringing all the country’s major cities under his control would also remove the threat that Assad’s international critics could push, as they once did, for a new Syrian settlement that does not include him as leader.\nModerate members of Syria’s opposition in exile say they fear not just for the people of Aleppo, but for the state of their wider cause, and believe the siege aimed not just to humble the city but also to polarise further a war that Assad has always cast as a battle between himself and extremists.\nIsis does not have a major presence in Aleppo. Opposition groups in 2014 lost more than 1,000 men, pushing the jihadis back to a small stretch of territory near the town of Manbij, which is now under a concerted assault by US-backed Kurdish and Arab fighters. But many of the groups fighting there are conservative Islamists, and moderates are worried that for this assault they have gathered around Jolani’s group.\nIt has shored up finances and power base as rivals splintered, and success in Aleppo would further entrench the group. “If the regime, Russians and other supporters had not brought a siege on Aleppo, we could have avoided the coalition of Nusra and the other groups joining it to fight,” said Bassma Kodmani, a member of the main opposition High Negotiating Council team for peace talks.\n“The most radical remain in the fight: that is the most alarming consequence of letting Aleppo come under siege,” she said. “The lack of some credible commitment from the international community leaves the opposition welcoming an offensive waged by Nusra because this is the only way to gain some leverage, to put some pressure on Russia and the regime. And that is really unfortunate.”\nRashwani confirmed that relief on the ground in Aleppo means there is little interest in who is doing the fighting.\n“No one is now thinking about Nusra or [the hardline Islamist group] Ahrar al-Sham. We are seeing a group of rebels doing their best to break this siege,” he said. “I was one of those people who started this revolution, so I believe that one day we will get our victory, and I need to be here at that moment.”\nTHE FACTIONS\nAssad and his allies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  President Bashar al-Assad. Photograph: AFP/Getty Images\n\n\nRegime forces\nThe Syrian army numbered 300,000 before the war but, after five years of fighting, it is barely a third of that.\nHezbollah\nHezbollah began to support Assad covertly soon after violence broke out and, in 2013, its leader publicly declared it had joined the war. It is believed to have lost hundreds of fighters, including its top military commander.\nIranian Revolutionary Guards\nIran firmly supports Assad, whom it sees as a key ally in a regional power struggle, and is supplying arms, fuel and hundreds of soldiers. Last year, it released photos of its most celebrated commander on the ground in Syria.\nShia militias\nIranian troops are fighting alongside, and coordinating, Shia militias recruited from across the region, including from Iraq, Afghanistan and even Pakistan.\nRussian air force\nLast autumn’s Russian air campaign was key to turning the tide of the war in Assad’s favour. Its planes can fly in weather that grounds the Syrian air force and have more powerful and accurate weapons.\nAnti-Assad forces in Aleppo\nFree Syrian Army\nThe moderate FSA, made up of many smaller groups, was the dominant opposition force in the first two years of the war. It was initially backed by the Arab states and got cautious US support. After years of disunity and faltering advances, its influence and territory has shrunk, while Islamist groups have grown.\nJaysh al-Fateh\nA broad coalition of Islamist factions that came together to fight Assad last year, when its advances forced Russia to come to his aid. Jaysh al-Fateh has been at the heart of the campaign to break the siege on Aleppo. The two most influential groups are as follows.\nJabhat Fateh al-Sham (formerly Jabhat al-Nusra)\nThe reconstituted al-Qaida affiliate renounced its ties to the global terror group last month and changed its name, but few observers believe that will herald any change in its ideology.\nAhrar al-Sham\nFormed by hardliners with Muslim Brotherhood links, who aim to establish a Sunni theocracy in Syria, Ahrar al-Sham fought with Nusra when it was still part of al-Qaida, but rejects international jihad itself. It has a strong support base in Syria.\n"

Photograph: Omar Haj Kadour/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\nKerry made his remarks as Russia sent naval reinforcements to the Mediterranean that western observers believe could be used for a fresh offensive on Aleppo.\nAs opposition forces attempted to break the siege of rebel-held eastern Aleppo with an assault heavily criticised by the United Nations, the Syrian government claimed that as many as 84 people had been killed and 280 wounded by opposition shelling over the past three days.\nRussia claims it has not bombed the city for a fortnight, but military clashes have persisted throughout Aleppo. Moscow has said it will respond with all available means if necessary.\nKerry said he would work right up to the end of Barack Obama’s presidency to try to find a political solution to the Syrian problem, which he described as a contorted web.\nHe implied he did not believe that a perceived power vacuum in Washington in the weeks after the 8 November presidential election would give Russia a chance to capture eastern Aleppo, and so deliver a hammer blow to the Syrian opposition.\nKerry was unusually frank in admitting western diplomats had been unable to persuade the legitimate opposition not to fight alongside Jabhat Fateh al-Sham. If the militant group decided to attack the regime during a ceasefire, he said, “then what happens is the regular opposition gets swept up with them … and then all of a sudden your ceasefire starts to shred”.\n\n\n\n\nAleppo ceasefire at risk after Russia says all rebels can be eliminated\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBashar al-Assad, he said, also played a major role in the breakdown of ceasefires by bombing legitimate opposition forces while claiming to go after Jabhat Fateh al-Sham and Islamic State (Isis). “So the opposition then get angry and say he is not showing good faith, because he is not, and it spirals downwards,” Kerry said.\nSyria, he argued, was “a whole bunch of wars taking place at once in the same place”. It was “Kurd v Kurd, Kurd v Turkey, Iran and Saudi; you have got Turkey, Daesh [Isis], Persian Shia versus Arab Sunni, Sunni v Shia, a lot of people against Assad, you have the challenge of Shia Iraqi militia coming into Syria and then, of course, you have Hezbollah-supporting Assad. So this is is about as toxic a diplomatic cocktail I can think of.”\n"

        "text": "\nWhen was so much faith last put into diplomacy? From Iran to Cuba, conflicts long locked in bitter stalemates have recently received the “jaw jaw” treatment. These are welcome developments in an era where resorting to bombs has all too often been the stuff of global politics. But much of this leaves open the question of what exactly defines a successful negotiation. What does diplomacy actually entail? Which approaches are most likely to succeed, or at least appear credible?\nThis is why it’s worth giving more scrutiny to how the frontrunner for the leadership of Britain’s main opposition party has tried to explain his willingness to engage in dialogue with representatives of unsavoury groups from the Middle East and elsewhere.\nAddressing criticism of his contacts with Hamas and Hezbollah, Jeremy Corbyn has explained that this was all about “determined dialogue and persistent diplomacy” in order to “forward peace processes”. Asked about his openness to the Kremlin’s take on Ukraine, he has not only resorted to the usual systematic anti-western discourse, but also indicated that showing a degree of understanding for Vladimir Putin is the right way to contribute to a solution.\nCorbyn has reacted to some of the scorn by saying that dialogue does not amount to “endorsing a particular set of views”, and that “it is necessary to speak to people with whom there is disagreement – merely talking to people who already agree won’t bring about a settlement”.\nDiplomacy obviously includes dialogue. But one major piece of the puzzle is missing in this line of reasoning. The art of negotiation and diplomacy, as thinkers as far back as Sun Tzu have well described, involves determining who holds the balance of power. Talking with dubious groups for the sake of it, simply as a gesture of goodwill, has little to do with diplomacy. Rather, it becomes a gesture of solidarity with your interlocutor.\n\n\n\n\n \n\nResults are obtained if you use the tools of power – including coercion\n\n\nFor the sake of argument, let’s take Corbyn’s explanations at face value, and believe he disagrees with parts of what his controversial contacts say or do (although he hasn’t specified what exactly these disagreements are). His stance can then come across as very attractive to the many people who rightly want conflicts to stop. Talking to “bad guys” (again, assuming Corbyn thinks they are bad) is surely part of getting them to change their minds, or their policies. Indeed, you only make peace with enemies.\nBut, in practice, conflict resolution rarely consists just of words or warm gestures. In the real world of diplomacy, dialogue works only if the interests of both parties line up for a compromise, or if those who seek to reach a settlement are in a position to exert pressure on adversaries. Results are obtained if you use the tools of power, including coercion (which doesn’t necessarily mean military action).\nTo assume that the very fact of talking will mellow an adversary is historically naive. It is non-operational. When Obama said in 2009 that America would “extend a hand [to its enemies] if you are willing to unclench your fist”, this was seen as a welcome break from the Bush years, but it was important not to forget the last part of his sentence.\nThere is no example of conflict resolution without balance of power. The Bosnian war wasn’t ended just through diplomatic summitry. It ended when the balance of forces was modified on the ground, and irresistible pressure was exerted on Milosevic. The recent nuclear agreement with Iran wasn’t forged only on the basis of talking: it was made possible when Iran understood there was no other way to get economic relief from sanctions, which had severely increased in recent years.\nWhen the US reached a diplomatic breakthrough with China in 1972, it wasn’t because Kissinger and Nixon had decided to be friendly to Mao. It was because a set of hardcore bilateral strategic interests had converged. Conflicts end through dialogue when opposing sides have exhausted all other options, when the benefits of compromise outweigh the cost of prolonging the dispute.\nBut when the readiness to talk is demonstrated without any leverage whatsoever, the outcome is just a PR stunt for the most dubious party involved. This is what happened when a group of French rightwing MPs met Bashar al-Assad earlier this year. The same occurred when Alexis Tsipras sat down to talk with Putin in Moscow. It’s no coincidence that Russia’s official media are currently giving Corbyn glowing coverage.\nThe point is not that talking with “bad guys” is wrong in itself. What matters are the circumstances, and how you lay out your strategy, and the means to achieve goals. George W Bush was mistaken not to engage with Iran back in 2003 when its regime seemed ready to unclench a fist after the invasion of Iraq. Europe must pursue difficult discussions with Putin, and results will be tied to the pressure exerted by sanctions. Diplomacy, as the Webster dictionary says, is either “the art and practice of conducting negotiations between nations”, or a “skill in handling affairs without arousing hostility”.\nThe diplomacy Corbyn has in mind is an ideological and complacent show from the sidelines, partly because he is not in power, but mostly because it is disconnected from how deals are reached in the real world.\n"

        "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/10/why-yemen-conflict-has-become-another-syria",
        "text": "\nThe brazen attempt by Houthi rebels to sink a US warship patrolling off Yemen marks a potentially significant escalation of a conflict that has been alternately fuelled and ignored by the western powers. The attack by the Houthis, whose main backer is Iran, coincides with an unprecedented ballistic missile strike 325 miles inside Saudi territory and suggests a spreading, region-wide conflagration could be nearer at hand than previously thought. \nInsurrection and revolt have been endemic in Yemen since the early part of this century. But the conflict intensified in March last year when Saudi Arabia, Iran’s main rival, launched a large-scale intervention, backed by a coalition of Arab states.\nSince then an estimated 10,000 Yemenis have died and many more have been injured, displaced or have faced famine conditions. The US and Britain back the Saudi coalition and have provided limited practical support such as intelligence-sharing and training, but have eschewed direct involvement in Yemen. The exception is the CIA’s repeated drone strikes, including those against alleged Islamic State and al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula terrorists. \n\n\n\n\nMissiles fired at US navy destroyer from rebel-held Yemen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs in Syria, the Obama administration has favoured a hands-off approach, preferring to act through proxies rather than engage directly. This diffidence stems from Barack Obama’s fear of the US being sucked into more Middle East wars. It is also the byproduct of his controversial attempt to mend fences with Iran through last year’s landmark nuclear deal.\nThe Syrian war has monopolised Washington’s diplomatic energy to the disadvantage of Yemen and other regional conflicts, such as Israel-Palestine. The unintentional message to Tehran and the Houthis has been that Yemen is not a priority. Partly as a result, repeated UN efforts to achieve some kind of peace settlement have been severely underpowered. \nBut unpredictable events upset the most careful policy. The US now risks getting sucked in more deeply. The American destroyer targeted at the weekend was in the area because of a previous Houthi attack on a United Arab Emirates vessel, part of the Saudi-led coalition. The destroyer belongs to a three-warship deployment in the Red Sea-Gulf of Aden area, armed with Tomahawk cruise missiles and carrying US special forces commandos. \nRiyadh has been shaken by an unprecedented Houthi ballistic missile strike on Taif, deep inside Saudi Arabia.\n\nMap\n\nMeanwhile, the weekend bombing of a Yemeni funeral ceremony attended by Houthi notables, killing at least 140 people, has further upset Washington’s calculations. Saudi-led coalition warplanes are widely held responsible. It was the latest in a string of atrocities involving civilians to be blamed on the Saudis. \nThe US strongly condemned the bombing and said it would review its support for the Saudi operations. Its angry words will further strain relations with Riyadh. The bombing also enables Russia and Iran to accuse the US of hypocrisy in Syria, where it broke off diplomatic talks following another outrage – the destruction last month of a UN aid convoy.\n\n\n\n\nWe saw how Yemen’s children are slowly starving to death | Krishnan Guru-Murthy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSensing perhaps that a wedge can be driven between Riyadh and an embarrassed Washington, Iran has been quick to complain to the UN about the funeral bombing. For a country guilty of serious, systemic human rights abuses, this may seem a bit rich. But it comes on top of western acceptance of the blocking by Arab states of a full UN human rights council investigation into atrocities in Yemen. \nWatching a power vacuum develop in as Obama nears the end of his term, hardliners in Iran’s Revolutionary Guards appear ready to up the ante not just in Yemen but in Iraq, where the Shia-led government is a close ally, and in Syria, where Iran’s own fighters and those of Hezbollah are keeping Bashar al-Assad’s forces on the offensive in Aleppo.\nSome analysts suggest an expansionist Iran, like Russia, is seeking permanent military bases on the Mediterranean in return for its help. Iran’s behaviour will disappoint those who backed Obama’s opening to Tehran and convince sceptics, such as Israel’s leadership, they were right to predict Tehran would maintain its feud with the west, continue to seek regional dominance and go on trying to destabilise predominantly Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies, wherever and whenever it can. \nNeglected diplomatically by the US and Europe, let down by UN human rights watchdog, fuelled by US and British arms sales and exploited and manipulated by Iran, the conflict in Yemen is another Syria, on a smaller scale. Like Syria it has increasing potential to blow up in the west’s face.\n"

        "text": "\nSay what you like about Barack Obama, but he has a way with words. At his final White House press conference on Friday, the president eloquently summarised the dreadful human situation in Syria following the fall of its most important rebel stronghold, the city of Aleppo, to the combined forces of Russia, Iran and the Syrian regime.\n“The world as we speak is united in horror at the savage assaults,” Obama said. “We have seen a deliberate strategy of surrounding, besieging and starving innocent civilians. We’ve seen relentless targeting of humanitarian workers and medical personnel and entire neighbourhoods reduced to rubble and dust. There are continuing reports of civilians being executed. These are all horrific violations of international law.”\nObama’s revulsion is fully justified. UN aid organisers, charity workers, Syrian community leaders, hospital doctors, foreign diplomats, reporters and editorial writers have run out of adjectives to adequately describe the full extent of the suffering experienced by ordinary people whose lives have been destroyed in the six-year-old war. Statistics, although difficult to digest, are still shocking: at least 500,000 killed, 1.9 million injured and more than half the country’s 23 million population forced to flee their homes.\nThis is a tragedy on a scale that beggars belief. Because it is so hard to comprehend, so horrific, so alien, the temptation is to turn away. But Syria and its people cannot be ignored, if only because their plight keeps getting worse – and because, in our modern, connected, globalised world, responsibility is shared. At a human level, there is no excuse for not knowing what is happening. At government level, there is no escaping a shared duty to try to make it stop. Obama had not finished his remarks before the politician in him took over. “Responsibility for this brutality lies in one place alone, with the Assad regime and its allies, Russia and Iran, and this blood and these atrocities are on their hands,” he said. The apportioning of blame is a principal reason why the conflict is so intractable. It is certainly true that the homicidal intransigence of Bashar al-Assad, Syria’s gormless dictator, lies at the heart of this catastrophe. Since initially overreacting to the local, non-violent protests against his minority Alawite regime in 2011, he has used systematic murder, torture, the terrorising of civilians, barrel bombs and chemical weapons to ensure his survival. The ultimate terrorist, Assad took his own nation hostage.\nIt is true that Russia, led by Vladimir Putin, has cynically exploited the war for its own purposes since intervening militarily in 2014. Putin sought to shore up Moscow’s only significant Arab ally and secure Russian naval and air bases. He sought to restore Soviet-era power and influence across the Middle East. He aimed to outflank Obama and has tried to curb the excesses of the Sunni jihadis of Islamic State, whose warped ideology threatens Russia as well as the west. In pursuing these objectives, Putin has demonstrated a degree of ruthlessness, and utter indifference to human suffering, that so shocked western leaders as to render them almost incapable of a coherent response.\nIt is also true that the Syrian war has enabled Iran to break free from the shackles imposed by decades of isolation and sanctions. Shia militias from Lebanon, Iraq and Afghanistan, organised by Iran’s Revolutionary Guards, have increasingly spearheaded the ground war. Pursuing a vengeful sectarian reckoning with Aleppo’s Sunnis, these same militias committed the atrocities reported last week by the UN. Iran’s leaders, in triumphal mood, see in the rebel defeat a victory over their Saudi rivals and the Great Satan itself. They hail a widening “Shia crescent”. Obama hoped last year’s nuclear deal with Tehran might encourage a more collaborative approach to Syria. He hoped in vain.\nBut it is unconvincing, and far too comfortable, to say, as Obama did, that these partners in crime – Russia, Iran and Assad, the three horsemen of the Syrian apocalypse – bear sole responsibility. Obama must take a share of the blame, for ignoring his own red lines on chemical weapons and creating a strategic vacuum into which Putin opportunistically advanced. So, too, must the US Congress, which opposed any meaningful Syrian military intervention, further tying Obama’s unwilling hands. Britain’s government and MPs, and their European counterparts, also have good reason to ask themselves if they fulfilled their wider responsibilities as guardians and representatives of the international order and international law. Over Syria, to varying degrees, everyone has blood on their hands.\nAll this is a matter for immense sadness and regret. But in truth, there is little time for backward-looking recriminations. Despite what Assad says, the war is not over. It is entering a new, extremely dangerous phase. The next likely flashpoint is Idlib province, where Aleppo fighters are regrouping. Idlib is a base for hardline Sunni salafists linked to al-Qaida. With the more moderate, western-backed rebel forces in disarray, there is a very real risk of the conflict morphing into a zero-sum sectarian struggle between increasingly radicalised Sunni insurgents and Iran’s fanatical Shia militias bent on extermination, not reconciliation. Iran’s aim seems to be to dominate postwar Syria politically and physically, as it now dominates post-invasion Iraq. This is a perilous prospect.\nA second flashpoint may be Syria’s disputed Golan Heights border with Israel. Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel’s bellicose prime minister, warned Tehran last week not to threaten his country. But the possibility that Lebanon’s Hezbollah, with Iran, could deploy close to Israeli territory, with all that implies for the Palestinian tinderbox, cannot be ignored. Netanyahu will not ignore it. When he meets Donald Trump and his hawkish, pro-Israel, anti-Iran national security team in Washington, Netanyahu will doubtless highlight the growing Iranian threat from Syria. For him, cancellation of the nuclear deal and reimposition of oil sanctions might be a good start. For Tehran’s leaders in an election year, it would be an incendiary provocation.\nThe third aspect is diplomatic: namely, Russia’s bid to take charge of peace negotiations that until now have been overseen by the UN and largely driven by the US and the EU. Putin’s unilateral announcement of ceasefire talks in Kazakhstan later this month, co-sponsored by Turkey and excluding the western powers, illuminates his ambition to elevate Russia as the Middle East’s premier power-broker and sideline the US and Europe. By posing as peacemaker, Putin hopes to confound those who accuse him of barbarism and war crimes. In Putin’s old KGB playbook about ends and means, a Russian-imposed settlement in Syria, however crude, would justify his brutal and illegal methods. For the world at large, that is the most dangerous outcome of all.\n"

        "text": "\nOn Friday, near Palmyra, 14 tanks and an anti-aircraft system were destroyed in an air strike on Isis. Palmyra recently fell to the jihadists after the Syrian regime and its allies diverted forces to Aleppo, leaving the ancient city under-defended.\nThis was a repeat of events last year when, on the advice of the Iranian general Qassem Suleimani, the regime deployed troops away from Palmyra to the strategically significant metropolis of Aleppo. The planes struck Palmyra on the same day Suleimani was photographed treading the city’s rubble. But the planes weren’t Russian or Syrian: they belonged to the US-led international coalition. While the US has its own reasons for battling Isis, in this case it was picking up the slack from the regime.\nPalmyra has only symbolic significance for Assad. Aleppo was the prize, and, with the world watching impotent, the regime was able to starve and bludgeon its population into surrender. The regime was aided by Russian bombers and special forces, Iranian Revolutionary Guards, Hezbollah mercenaries, and a horde of sectarian militias from Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan – but, above all, it was aided by American indifference.\nIn an interview with Jeffrey Goldberg of the Atlantic magazine earlier this year, President Obama said he was “very proud” of the moment in 2013 when, against the “overwhelming weight of conventional wisdom”, he decided not to honour his own “red line”, allowing Assad to escape accountability for a chemical attack that had killed more than 1,400 civilians.\nObama may be alone in this judgment. A year earlier, seemingly on a whim, he had set a red line on the use of chemical weapons at a time when none were being used. The red line was, in effect, a green light to conventional killing. But the regime called Obama’s bluff – and, predictably, he backed down. No longer fearing punishment, the regime escalated its tactics.\nNearly four times as many people were killed in the two years after the chemical attack as had died in the two years before. Obama’s abandonment discredited Syria’s nationalist opposition and empowered the Islamists. It helped Isis emerge from the shadows to establish itself as a major force. Together, these developments triggered a mass exodus that would displace over half the country’s population. And as the overflow from this deluge started trickling into Europe, it sparked a xenophobic backlash that has empowered the far right across the west.\nThese, however, weren’t the only consequences of Obama’s retreat. The inaction also created a vacuum that was filled by Iran and Russia. Emboldened by his unopposed advances into Ukraine and Syria, Putin has been probing weaknesses in the west’s military and political resolve – from provocative flights by Bear bombers along the Cornwall coast to direct interference in the US elections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  A man praying near the Umayyad mosque in the ruins of Aleppo. Photograph: STR/EPA\n\n\nThe post-second-world-war international order is on the verge of collapse. In January, when Obama leaves office, he will be leaving the world a lot less stable than even his predecessor.\nBut in his valedictory press conference, last Friday, Obama defended his policy on Syria – albeit with logic whose fractures even his eloquence could not conceal. Inverting cause and consequence, he cited Russian and Iranian presence in Syria as his reason for not confronting Assad (neither was there in August 2013); he cited the disunion among rebels as the reason for not supporting them (they fragmented because they were denied meaningful support); and he cited the fear of deeper American involvement as his justification for restraint (even though a year later it would lead to a far bigger deployment across two states).\nThe administration’s response to the neoconservative depredations of the past decade was to revert to old dogmas: the dogmas of “realism”. Under the influence of doctrinaire realists, Obama concluded that the Arab world was not ready for democracy; it needed “strongmen”. The strongmen would protect the west against the twin threats of terror and migration. This logic led the US to back Nouri al-Maliki’s sectarian government after the controversial 2010 election in Iraq; it also led it to tolerate Assad. Syria was defined narrowly as a counterterrorism problem.\nBut there was also another reason for tolerating Assad. The administration had gambled its reputation on the Iran deal – a deal whose success would distinguish Obama from his belligerent and quixotic predecessor. Iranian leaders, however, understood that by investing his legacy in the deal, Obama had also made himself its hostage. He couldn’t make too many demands for fear of undoing his own legacy. Conscious of this, Iranian hardliners saw no cause for constraint. Flush with cash from the deal, they have embarked on a foreign policy far more intransigent than anything Iran has pursued in a century. Tehran has little need for nuclear weapons when it can conquer Aleppo without them. And, as a client of Iran, Assad has enjoyed impunity.\nAleppo fell on Obama’s watch. He did not raise a finger to save the city even though he had mobilised America’s vast military assets on short notice to defend Kobani and imposed a no-fly zone over Hasakah. By withholding leverage, Obama also allowed Russia to use the charade of diplomacy to aid Iran and the regime’s military conquest.\nIn January, as Obama surrenders the White House to America’s own strongman, the Iran deal will probably not survive long. Its benefits were already made doubtful by Obama’s invertebracy. It is Aleppo that the world will remember him by.\nDr Muhammad Idrees Ahmad (@im_pulse) is author of The Road to Iraq: The Making of a Neoconservative War (Edinburgh University Press, 2014)\n"

        "text": "\nSupporters of Iran’s national team have been asked to wear black and unite in religious chants rather than football songs during Tuesday afternoon’s World Cup qualifying match against South Korea, after a row broke out over the game’s clash with a day of mourning in the Shia calendar. \nSenior clerics from the holy city of Qom, home to prominent Shia Islam seminaries, and hardliners in Tehran had initially called for the match at the capital’s majestic Azadi stadium to be postponed.\nThe informal voluntary Basij militia and home-grown Hezbollah supporters have staged protests in Tehran and other major cities, threatening to confront fans. For them, a football match is at odds with the spirit of the sombre occasion of Ashura, which falls on Wednesday. \nFaced with an intransigent Fifa, Iranian officials allowed the game to go ahead. The influential cleric Ali Movahedi-Kermani used his weekly sermon on Friday to set conditions for the 100,000 fans expected to attend and the authorities in charge of the country’s sport. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  A woman holds a picture of Iran’s Ayatollah Ali Khamenei during a gathering a day ahead of the Ashura rituals in Beirut, Lebanon.

Everyone has to be covered in black and the crowd should chant Ya Hussein. Instead of clapping hands, everyone has to chant Ya Hussein,” Movahedi-Kermani said. \nMedia reports say riot police have been deployed near the stadium. \nAshura, which occurs on the 10th day of the Islamic month of Muharram, marks the death of the prophet Muhammad’s grandson, Hussein ibn Ali, at the battle of Karbala, which is in present-day Iraq, in AD680. It is a significant occasion for Shia Muslims across the world, who wear black during the whole month and participate in street ceremonies that involve mourning, beating their chests and slapping their heads. \nThe commemorations are widely observed in Iran and not just by those sympathetic to the ruling establishment – some younger people who may not practise the religion during the rest of the year also take part. For many, it is a chance to prepare food to donate or participate in what has increasingly become like a huge carnival. \nIran’s religious state has often exploited Ashura, with the authorities using the commemorations to spread their own message. Iranian leaders evoke Ashura as the main driving force behind the concept of martyrdom and resistance. The state also often sees itself as a defender of oppressed nations and frames regional conflicts, such as in Palestine, Syria or Iraq, in a religious context. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Ashura ceremonies in the city of Khorramabad. Photograph: Abedin Taherkenareh/EPA\n\n\nThe controversy over Tuesday’s match was so great that the country’s supreme national security council had to step in to soothe concerns. At the weekend, Alaeddin Boroujerdi, an influential MP, announced that the council had given the go-ahead for the match. \n“According to Fifa regulations, if Iran refrains from playing in this game, then it will be barred from two more matches,” he was quoted as saying. “The supreme national security council concluded that the game can take place, though compatible with the spirit of Ashura and Hussein symbols all over the stadium.”\nAlthough there has often been a backlash when Iranians have been told what to wear and what to say in public, fans are expected to be respectful of the commemorations. South Korean players were reportedly going to wear black armbands as a sign of respect. \n"

        "text": "\nMight not the danger of Ukip be different to that posed in your leader (Nigel Farage’s resignation shows he is not serious, 5 July)? Ukip has acted as a basket for discontented Tory voters – just as the Liberals have done since Orpington. And, since Orpington, most of those voters returned to the Tory ranks at a subsequent election. Not so with Labour voters. Ukip’s deadly threat has always been to Labour.\nAlmost 150,000 former Labour voters crossed over to Ukip at the 2010 election. Five years later, at the 2015 election, this number had increased to nearly a million. Given the large number of Ukip votes that come from people who had given up voting, that leaves Ukip’s base being made up of 24% of voters who had previously supported Labour candidates. This shift has positioned Ukip as the runner-up to Labour in 44 constituencies. Moreover, most Labour MPs now represent constituencies that voted leave in the EU referendum.\nWhile Labour tries to re-establish class politics, Ukip has moved on. The politics of national identity, a sense of place and community, the position of England and its culture, are now going to increasingly determine party loyalties. Post-referendum politics will speed up this process as our negotiating team will be involved in constructing defences for poorer voters against globalisation. Where is the voice of the Labour party in helping shape events that will determine the basis of a new party system in our democracy? The sooner we move to having a leader of the parliamentary party to take us into elections, and a leader of our activists in the country, the better.Frank Field MPLabour, Birkhenhead\n• Jeremy Corbyn’s video appeal to members emphasises his successful record as leader, in achieving Tory U-turns on tax credits and forced academisation of schools, and in attracting many more party members (Watson to seek union support for ‘last roll of dice’ appeal to Corbyn, 5 July). Those are real achievements, but their significance is dwarfed by the impending catastrophe of Brexit. It is becoming clear that the best (albeit slim) chance of averting such a disaster would be a general election fought by Labour, the Lib Dems and the SNP on a remain ticket. So at this pivotal moment in our country’s history, the only question for members of the Labour party should be this: is the current party leader capable of successfully leading such a campaign? If he isn’t, he needs to be replaced by someone who can. The future of the United Kingdom is more important than the future of any one individual or party.David HoultStockport\n• With a staggering lack of self-perception, Chuka Umunna MP, describes Momentum as “a party within a party” (Report, 5 July). If there is a group within the Labour party which is acting, yet again, as “a party within a party” it is the parliamentary Labour party.

        "text": "\nBritish MPs are deceiving themselves if they believe they do not bear some of the responsibility for the “terrible tragedy” unfolding in Syria, the former chancellor, George Osborne, said on Tuesday during an often anguished emergency debate in the House of Commons on the carnage being inflicted in eastern Aleppo. In one of his first speeches in the Commons since losing office, Osborne said there had been “multiple opportunities to intervene” in Syria as he cited parliament’s decision in 2013 not to take military action after the use of chemical weapons by Bashar al-Assad’s regime.\n\n\n\n\nChildren trapped in building under attack in Aleppo, doctor tells UN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Let’s be clear now: if you do not shape the world, you will be shaped by it. We are beginning to see the price of not intervening,” Osborne said. \nThe Commons voted by a majority of 13 in 2013 to reject military action after Labour combined with Tory rebels to deliver David Cameron his single biggest Commons rebuff. \nThe Speaker had granted Tuesday’s emergency debate to the former Conservative cabinet minister Andrew Mitchell, who said that, even at this late stage, a humanitarian corridor should be established in east Aleppo to allow innocent civilians to leave the city for safety.\nThe foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, ruled out air drops of aid, saying it was too dangerous to fly into airspace controlled by Russia and Syria and that UK planes would be sitting ducks. Johnson said the slaughter in eastern Aleppo “shames us all” and promised that the government was pulling every diplomatic lever at its disposal.\nLike Osborne, Johnson attributed some blame to the 2013 Commons vote to reject military action. “Our ability to influence events in Syria or to protect civilians or compel the delivery of aid has been severely limited,” he said. “The dictator was left to do his worst, along with his allies, Russia and Iran, and the bloodiest tragedy of the 21st century has since unfolded.”\nThe inescapable reality, Johnson said, was that “we as a House of Commons, we as a country, we vacated that space into which Russia stepped, beginning its own bombing campaign on behalf of Assad”. \nBut in a speech that overshadowed contributions by the Labour front bench and Johnson, Osborne largely ignored the short-term calls for aid drops, but slammed MPs for giving Assad and his Russian sponsors the green light to destroy the democratic Syrian opposition using sarin gas.\nIn an attack in effect aimed at the former Labour leader Ed Miliband, who ordered Labour MPs to vote against military action in 2013, Osborne said: “I have to say the whole concept of an emergency debate suggests that somehow this tragedy has come upon us out of the blue and indeed it has an almost natural element to it. That is not the case. The Syrian civil war has been waging since 2011, and therefore it is something that we could have foreseen and done something about.\n\n\n\n\nJeremy Corbyn: Theresa May needs to press for Syria crisis resolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“I think we are deceiving ourselves in this parliament if we believe that we have no responsibility for what has happened in Syria. The tragedy in Aleppo did not come out of a vacuum; it was created by a vacuum, a vacuum of western leadership, of American leadership, British leadership.”\nIn an assessment that is known to represent David Cameron’s views, Osborne said the UK’s involvement in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan meant politicians in the UK knew the “price of intervention”. “I think we have come to a point where it’s impossible to intervene anywhere, that we lack the political will as the west to intervene,” he said. “But I have some hope out of this terrible tragedy in Syria which is we are beginning to learn the price of not intervening.” \n Mitchell read out the words of an Aleppo resident, who said a “human corridor” needed to be established to evacuate civilians from the bombarded city and that “nobody will ever believe” Britain again over fighting terror if it ignored “state terror”. \nThe shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, who is under pressure over the reluctance of Jeremy Corbyn to criticise Russia, insisted that Labour had condemned the Kremlin and Assad for their actions in eastern Aleppo. “We must ensure they are one day held to account, while we equally condemn Iran and Hezbollah for the role they have played in this massacre. It was a global collective failure, every bit as great as … Srebrenica,” she said.\n\n\n\n\nAleppo’s people are being slaughtered. Did we learn nothing from Srebrenica? | Nedžad Avdić\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Labour MP John Woodcock, a long-term advocate of intervention, said: “We’ve said ‘Never again’ so many times, and we mean it when we say it, but then, a few months, a few years later, it comes to nothing.” \nCommenting on Osborne’s speech, Woodcock said: “He gave the speech that should have been made from our despatch box and he showed a level of understanding about these issues which shows that, which makes me hope very much that he has a future in his party.” \nHe attacked his party’s stance in 2013, saying: “I still feel sick at the idea of the then leader of the opposition going from that vote into the whips’ office and congratulating himself and them on stopping a war, when look what is happening today and look what’s happened over the last three years.”\n"

        "text": "\nTheresa May will say the Iran nuclear deal is “vitally important” in her first major intervention on the issue since the election of Donald Trump, who has said he plans to tear up the agreement secured by the Obama administration.\nSpeaking on Wednesday, the prime minister will tell Gulf leaders in Bahrain that Iran remains a threat to the stability of the Middle East and the UK would not ignore “aggressive” Iranian actions in Syria and Yemen.\nAddressing the plenary of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) in Manama, May will say she is realistic about the threat Iran poses in the Gulf and the wider region, and prepared to “confront state actors whose influence fuels instability”.\nHowever, the prime minister will also underline the importance of the 2015 agreement, saying it makes more direct engagement with Iran on issues of concern possible in a “clear-eyed, hard-headed manner”.\n“We secured a deal that has neutralised the possibility of Iran acquiring nuclear weapons for more than a decade,” she will say. “It has already seen Iran remove 13,000 centrifuges, together with associated infrastructure, and eliminate its stock of 20%-enriched uranium.\n“That was vitally important for regional security. But we must also work together to push back against Iran’s aggressive regional actions, whether in Lebanon, Iraq, Yemen, Syria or in the Gulf itself.”\n\n\n\n\nWhile many Iranians fear Trump presidency, others see opportunities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump has threatened to scrap the deal, signed by six major powers including Britain, in which Iran agreed to scale down its nuclear programme in exchange for sanctions relief. US Republicans opposed the deal brokered by the Obama administration and called for sanctions to be increased. \nIn March, Trump told supporters that his number one foreign policy objective was to “dismantle the disastrous deal with Iran”, which he has since called “the worst deal ever negotiated”. \nMay’s comments make it clear to the US president-elect and the Iranian government that the UK would consider itself bound by the deal even if the US withdrew. Britain, along with the other signatories France, Germany, Russia and China, has resumed trade relations with Iran since sanctions were lifted.\nOn Tuesday, Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, said Trump could not unilaterally dismantle the deal. ”Do you think he can rip up the [deal]?” he said. “Do you think we and our nation will let him do that?”\nThe outgoing director of the CIA, John Brennan, has told of disastrous consequences if Trump renounces the agreement, warning that this would be the “height of folly” and any breakdown in relations could lead to a nuclear arms race with other Gulf states.\nIsrael, which opposes the deal, has said the terms do not prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon within the next decade. The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has said he intends to press Trump to renege on the “bad deal”.\nMay, who is holding bilateral meetings with six Gulf leaders during her two-day visit to Bahrain, will lead a focused session on Iran and regional security issues after the speech.\nDowning Street said she would highlight key areas of concern, including the al-Quds force of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards acting in Syria to shore up the Assad regime and working with Hezbollah in Lebanon.\nAlthough her remarks on Wednesday are likely to be interpreted as a warning to Trump not to pull the US out of the deal, May told reporters she got on well with Trump on a personal level in their two phone calls, saying he was “very easy to talk to”.\n“He is someone who very much values the relationship he has with the UK,” she said.\n“Whenever we’ve talked, that’s been one of the key things we’ve talked about; the depth of our special relationship and the fact we want to maintain that and build on it for the future.”\nOn Tuesday, May met the leaders of the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia for bilateral talks lasting roughly 30 minutes each, and dined with all six GCC leaders on Tuesday night. Downing Street sources said talks with the UAE focused on trade and investment.\nSaudi Arabia’s role in the Yemen conflict was raised with King Salman, with the need for a comprehensive Saudi investigation into human rights abuses emphasised during the meeting, a source said. May will also criticise Iran’s support for Houthi rebels in the conflict in her speech on Wednesday. \n“The PM said it was very important lessons are learned and acted upon,” the source said, but Downing Street did not call for an independent UN investigation into Saudi forces’ conduct in Yemen.\nMore than 6,800 people have been killed in the country, the majority in Saudi-led airstrikes in support of the Yemeni president, Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi.\nDowning Street would not confirm whether specific cases of imprisoned or exiled dissidents in the Gulf had been raised during the talks, but she is due to have a working lunch with the king of Bahrain on Wednesday. \nMPs from the all-party parliamentary group on democracy and human rights in the Gulf wrote to May on Tuesday, asking her to raise the case of Nabeel Rajab, the president of the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights, who is facing up to 15 years in prison for offences including insulting the state in an article he wrote for the New York Times.\n“The European parliament, the United Nations and the US state department have all expressly called for his release from prison,” the letter said. “To date, the United Kingdom has not done likewise.” \n"

        "text": "\nWestern diplomats have conceded that there are no technical obstacles to a plan to deliver airdrops of food and medicine to Aleppo using a GPS-guided parachute system, but the scheme has been stalled in the face of reluctance among military commanders and an absence of political will.\nDiplomats and military from six governments – including the UK, US, France and Germany – have now seen the detailed operational plan proposed by an aid agency, which has been circulating among western officials for over a month.\nThe plan, which has been seen by the Guardian, relies on technology known as the the Joint Precision Airdrop System (JPads), which has been used by the US military since 2001 to supply troops in forward-offensive positions in areas of Afghanistan too difficult or dangerous to reach by road. It uses pallets dropped by parachute and guided by GPS navigation and a rudder. \nAccording to the plan there are three identified feasible landing points inside east Aleppo. The main aim is to get some humanitarian supplies into the embattled and shrinking enclave to keep people alive in the hope that talks would lead to a longer-term solution.\n\n\n\n\nSyria: Assad loyalists take Aleppo's Old City as rebels plead for ceasefire\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plan envisaged an initial delivery of 20 pallets and the flights could depart from RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus or the Incirlik air base in Turkey. The ICRC could potentially verify that packages were for humanitarian purposes alone.\nAircraft would keep within 25km of the Turkish border and always remain over opposition-controlled areas. The pallets can be dropped from around 25,000ft and have a drift zone of up to 25km, thereby overcoming the main objection to air drops: that it would bring Nato planes into range of Syrian and Russian jets and air defence systems.\n However, although the plan has been generally embraced by diplomats, there has been resistance from western military officers. \n“One military was so reticent they denied the capability even existed,” said a source familiar with the meetings. While the technology is currently only used by the US military, its existence is clearly noted on the manufacturer’s website.\nChris Harmer, retired naval aviator and a senior analyst at the Institute for the Study of War, said: “The military has not prioritised getting this out there, there’s a sense that the military doesn’t want to get drawn into this theatre. And nobody has told them to.”\n\nAid drops map\n\nDiscussions about air-dropping food into Aleppo and other besieged enclaves have been under way for months in Washington between US and UK officials, but have been stalled over inter-agency disagreements. Meanwhile, rebel-held eastern Aleppo has been overrun by pro-regime forces led by Lebanese Hezbollah and Iranian-led Shia militias supported by Russian and Syrian regime aerial bombardment. Failure to agree an enduring ceasefire has stopped road convoys from getting through for more than 150 days.\nOvernight on Wednesday about 150 civilians, most either disabled or in need of urgent care, were evacuated from a hospital in Aleppo’s Old City – the first major medical evacuation from the eastern sector. They had been trapped there for days by nearby fighting, a spokeswoman for the International Committee of the Red Cross said. Six children, found alone in nearby streets were also evacuated. \nThe UK shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, said: “The government has made clear in the past that it regards air drops as a last resort in Syria, but that is surely now the point that we have reached. I would urge the government to make every last effort, and explore every last option, to get food and medical supplies to the civilians trapped in east Aleppo before it becomes too late.”\nIn the UK 201 MPs from across the political spectrum have said they would vote to airdrop humanitarian aid into the city if a parliamentary vote was held on the issue.\nThe foreign office minister Tobias Ellwood stated during parliamentary questions on 28 November that there was “the possibility that a British aircraft could be shot down”. It is unclear whether Ellwood was aware of the JPads proposal when he made the comments to parliament.\nIt is understood that the UK, France, and Germany all possess the capability to launch aid-dropping missions in this way, though the delivery system itself is only owned by the US.\nThose on the ground have welcomed the call. Syrian Civil Defense maintains an active presence and has responded to a call for airdrops with the following statement: “The situation in Aleppo is desperate. We have the capacity to collect aid and deliver it to humanitarian organisations and hospitals as needed. We stand ready to help our people.”\nTwo engineering graduates from Aleppo University, Abdulrahman and Amr Shayah, launched an urgent appeal on Friday for JPads to be used to help the surviving civilians in the city. \n“Parachutes have been used by the Russian and Syrian air forces to drop bombs … on civilian areas of the besieged city. Parachutes could be used to send urgently needed food and medical aid instead,” they said. \n Alison McGovern, chair of Britain’s Syria all-party parliamentary group, said: “The government should be exploring all possible options to get aid to the desperate civilians on the ground … the government should come back to the House of Commons urgently with a plan that delivers the maximum amount of aid with the minimum risk to our armed forces.”\n"

        "text": "\nHezbollah, the Lebanese militant group, planned to assassinate the former Israeli prime minister Ehud Olmert to avenge the killing of one of its senior military leaders by the Mossad secret service, it has been reported.\nThe plot was reportedly thwarted because a Hezbollah security official was working undercover for the Israelis and tipped them off in advance. The date or location of the alleged attack were not published.\nAl-Arabi al-Jadeed, a London-based Arabic daily newspaper, broke the sensational-sounding but hard-to-verify story about clandestine warfare between bitter enemies from Beirut, attributing it to unnamed political sources with close links to Hezbollah.\nNeither Israeli nor Hezbollah officials commented on the report, but there has been partial confirmation from an Israeli newspaper report that security around Olmert, now retired, had been tightened a year ago due to fears of possible retaliation for the killing of Imad Mughniyeh in Damascus in 2008. Haaretz gave no source for its story. As prime minister, Olmert launched Israel’s invasion of Lebanon in 2006.\nMughniyeh, Hezbollah’s military chief, was held responsible for deadly attacks on American and Israeli targets in Lebanon and abroad over two decades. Until the emergence of Osama Bin Laden and al-Qaida in the 1990s he was probably the most wanted man in the Middle East.\nMughniyeh was walking down a Damascus street in February 2008 when a bomb planted in a parked SUV exploded, killing him. Prior to the blast, a team of CIA spotters were monitoring his movements in the Syrian capital as Mossad agents remotely triggered the bomb from Tel Aviv, according to a recent detailed report in the Washington Post. \nAl Araby al-Jadeed said the plan to kill Olmert, who was Israel’s prime minister in 2008, was not carried out due to information provided by Mohammad Shawraba, a senior official in the external operations branch of the Iranian-backed Shia organisation.\nShawraba was arrested several months ago by Hezbollah’s internal security force and is said to have admitted to collaborating with Israel. Arab media have said he foiled attacks against Israeli targets in Azerbaijan, Turkey, Cyprus and Peru, with the information that he is said to have provided to Israel. In 2012 a suicide bombing attack that killed five Israeli tourists and a Bulgarian was blamed on Hezbollah.\nShawraba, a businessman, was recruited by the Mossad in a “western Asian country”, according to a December report in the Lebanese daily al-Nashra.\nHezbollah has not commented on those reports but has acknowledged that Shawraba was arrested and admitted working with Israel. Hassan Nasrallah, the group’s leader, acknowledged this openly three weeks ago in an interview.\nAccording to the Washington Post, which quoted former US officials, the CIA and the Mossad were jointly responsible for the assassination of Mughniyeh. Last month, Mughniyeh’s son, Jihad, also a high-ranking Hezbollah operative, was killed in an air strike in Syria that was widely attributed to Israel. A senior Iranian Revolutionary Guard commander died in the same attack.\n"

        "text": "\nIt was the year of the hard man – the tough-guy leader with a ruthless streak and a big ego. In Moscow, Vladimir Putin, a role model for the genre, strengthened his harsh grip on domestic politics while intensifying Russia’s cyber-digital “war of influence” with the west. In Beijing, China’s president, Xi Jinping, attained a kind of immortality when his unoriginal thoughts were enshrined in the Communist party constitution. In Washington, Donald Trump enacted a charlatan parody of the US presidency, blending power and ignorance to an alarming degree.\nThe heavy mob attracted a cohort of emulators and imitators – “little big men” such as Kim Jong-un, the inexperienced, nuclear-armed North Korean dictator and Rodrigo Duterte, the homicidal president of the Philippines. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Turkey’s choleric president, worked assiduously to dismantle his country’s secular democratic tradition, using a failed 2016 coup as a pretext. Saudi Arabia’s uncrowned leader and ostensible reformer, the youthful Prince Mohammad bin Salman, made a series of clumsy regional power plays.\nThe corollary to the rise of the hard man was a sense of debilitating weakness among western democracies and of a crumbling postwar international strategic and legal order. The rising power of one-party China, spreading authoritarianism in general, and divisive, populist and nationalistic regressions within Europe highlighted the dilemma. The west’s difficulties were compounded by uncertainty over how to handle Trump and navigate a disorientating new era of weakening American global leadership.\nNuclear threat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Kim Jong-Un celebrating the successful test-fire of the intercontinental ballistic missile in July. Photograph: AFP/Getty Images\n\n\nNorth Korea emerged as 2017’s most dangerous international security problem. Pyongyang’s development of nuclear weapons and long-range ballistic missiles in defiance of the UN and its neighbours is not a new phenomenon. What changed in 2017 was the juxtaposition, in opposing corners, of two volatile, foolish and inexperienced leaders: Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump.\nAware of Trump’s campaign threats to topple his regime, Kim – in power since the death of his father in 2011 – appeared determined to test the new American president’s mettle. A series of missile test launches, some close to Japan, was followed in September by a first underground test of a powerful hydrogen bomb. Since then North Korea has threatened another nuclear detonation – this time in the atmosphere over the Pacific, possibly near the US territory of Guam. Pyongyang now says it can strike any part of the US – something Washington had vowed to prevent.\n\n\n\n\nHave we got just three months to avert a US attack on North Korea? | Mark Seddon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump’s response was contradictory from the start. He held out the prospect of talks with Pyongyang, and even a personal meeting with Kim, and criticised Japan and South Korea for not doing enough to defend themselves. At other times, he threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea. He derided Kim as “little rocket man” and a “sick puppy” and scolded his secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, for wasting time by pursuing diplomatic solutions. Not to be outdone, North Korea dubbed Trump an “ageing lunatic” and “senile dotard”.\nDuring an Asian tour in 2017, Trump pledged solidarity with South Korea and Japan, where Shinzō Abe, the hawkish prime minister, won reelection in October partly because of worries about North Korea. But the thrust of Trump’s approach – inducing China, North Korea’s only influential ally, to pressure Kim to disarm – brought mixed results. Beijing backed tougher UN sanctions but declined to cut vital oil supplies to Pyongyang. Xi remained reluctant to tackle Kim directly, fearing the instability the regime’s collapse would cause – and because China has no wish to see a reunified Korea allied to the US.\nThe Korean crisis has the potential to reignite at any moment, as yet another provocative, long-range missile test in late November demonstrated. Trump ordered a buildup of naval and air power around the peninsula, and nuclear-capable US bombers “buzzed” North Korean defences. Such brinkmanship is extraordinarily dangerous, since it may convince Kim he is about to be attacked. South Korea’s training of special forces whose only purpose is to “decapitate” the Pyongyang regime will likely increase his paranoia. A momentary miscalculation by either side could bring calamity.\nTrump’s relationship with Xi, whom he invited to a get-to-know-you summit at his Florida estate in April and met again in Beijing in November, proved a one-sided affair. The US leader condemned China during his election campaign, terming it an “enemy” because of its supposedly unfair trade practices. But in Beijing, he praised Xi for outsmarting previous US administrations on trade. He seemed unduly impressed by Xi’s unchallenged domestic ascendancy, confirmed at a Communist party congress in October.\n\n\n\n\nThe Guardian view on Syria: Putin tests the west | Editorial\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking at the congress, Xi hailed a “new era” of Chinese prosperity and global power. China, he said, would transform itself into a “mighty force” in the world. “It will be an era that sees China moving closer to centre stage and making greater contributions to mankind,” Xi said. The potentially negative implications of these “contributions” for postwar American strategic dominance of the Asia-Pacific region, and western influence and interests in Africa and Latin America, were painfully obvious.\nBut apparently not to Trump. Prioritising a deal on North Korea, he gave Xi a free pass on trade and failed to challenge him, for example, on China’s illegal military expansionism in the South China Sea, its threats to Taiwan, its subjugation of Tibet, its yawning democratic deficit, or its dreadful human rights record. By withdrawing from the TransPacific Partnership, Trump gave the Chinese another opportunity to extend their reach. No wonder they like him in China. Yet Xi still denied him a breakthrough on North Korea.\nXi was not the only leader to benefit from Trump’s naivety, fondness for authoritarianism, and easily exploited egotism. Putin appeared to convince Trump that Russia was a trustworthy partner in solving problems such as Syria – despite Moscow’s support for Bashar al-Assad’s proscribed regime in Damascus and its alleged involvement in chemical weapons attacks and other war crimes. Putin pushed for a lifting of sanctions imposed after Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea and still unresolved military intervention in Ukraine. To Europe’s dismay, Trump was sympathetic. He was persuaded not to go ahead – for now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin Photograph: Mikhail Klimentyev/EPA\n\n\nMost astonishingly of all, perhaps, Trump contradicted the findings of his own intelligence agencies and accepted Putin’s assurances that Russia did not interfere in last year’s US presidential election to disadvantage his opponent, Hillary Clinton. Despite an accelerating special counsel federal investigation, numerous Congressional inquiries, and guilty pleas by former advisers, Trump continued to deny any Russian connection, denouncing claims as “fake news”. Trump’s business dealings with well-connected Russians, dating back to the 1990s, also came under scrutiny.\nThis month, the reported agreement of the former national security adviser Michael Flynn to cooperate with prosecutors extended the scandal into the heart of the White House. If firm evidence is found of a conspiracy, coverup or obstruction of justice, Trump’s impeachment could follow.\n\n\n\n\nCharlottesville's white awakening: 'We were living in a bubble,' say residents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn terms of negative headlines, Trump’s first 11 months in office may have set some kind of record. His travel ban targeting citizens of Muslim countries was repeatedly struck down in the courts, though earlier this month the supreme court ruled it could be imposed while multiple challenges are resolved. \nHis refusal to condemn violence by far-right nationalists and white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia, brought protests, with critics labelling him a racist and a closet bigot. US national divisions were fuelled, in turn, by Trump’s splenetic denunciation of American football players who knelt before games to highlight disproportionate violence against black people. \nIssuing daily blasts via Twitter, Trump rarely missed an opportunity to start a row, raising America’s “culture wars” to a new level. This month he used Twitter to gratuitously insult a close ally, Theresa May. Yet despite the advantage of a Republican-controlled Congress, Trump’s legislative agenda, notably healthcare, went nowhere – with the exception of a bill cutting taxes for corporations and the very rich. Having failed to build political coalitions, he relied on executive orders of dubious validity. The Trump White House saw high level resignations and sackings. Trump finished 2017 as possibly the most unpopular, least respected president ever. He also set another record: more time spent playing golf than any predecessor.\nEuropean elections\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  French presidential election candidate debate between Marine Le Pen and Emmanuel Macron. Photograph: CHAMUSSY/SIPA/REX/Shutterstock\n\n\nEurope survived a year of unusual political turmoil, but its problems are far from resolved. The year’s opening saw a rising populist tide generated by fears about immigration, economic pain, Euroscepticism, loss of identity and plain old xenophobia. But despite predictions to the contrary, the centre held – just – in national elections in the Netherlands, France and Germany. Commenting on the voters’ rejection of the far-right Islamophobe Geert Wilders, the Dutch prime minister declared: “The Netherlands said whoa!”\nEmmanuel Macron’s triumphal election as France’s president was nevertheless qualified by significant advances made by Marine Le Pen, the Front National leader, who came second with 34% support. If Macron fails to achieve the reforms he promised – and the year ended with his approval ratings slumping – then Le Pen could be well placed to supplant him next time. Likewise in Germany, Angela Merkel’s centre-right Christian Democrats re-emerged as the biggest party in September. But they lost support to the far-right Alternative for Germany, while the centre-left Social Democrats were crushed. Merkel was still struggling to form a new coalition government at year’s end.\n\n\n\n\nMadrid and Barcelona need to talk. That’s not on the cards\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGermany’s unprecedented postwar political turmoil added to the jitters affecting the EU. The UK obsessed over negotiating the terms of Brexit, for which it formally applied in March, setting a leaving date in 2019. Compounding the uncertainty, May’s Conservative government lost its parliamentary majority in an ill-conceived snap election in June. In Italy, a rightwing alliance overseen by Silvio Berlusconi, the disgraced former prime minister, looked poised for a comeback in 2018.\nIn Spain, a declaration of independence by Catalonia’s separatist leadership was rejected by the unionist government of Mariano Rajoy. In eastern Europe, Euroscepticism was on the rise. Governments in Poland and Hungary battled the European commission over civil rights and media curbs. The Baltic states worried about security, and Nato deployed troops to border areas.\nFor Europe as a whole, the intentions of Putin’s Russia appeared increasingly malign. Moscow was accused of using cyberattacks, misinformation, social media manipulation and other “active measures” to undermine and destabilise all the western democracies, not only the United States. \nIn Britain, Theresa May claimed in a tough speech in November that Putin was “weaponising information”. “Russia, we know what you are doing,” she said. By year’s end there was pressure in Britain to investigate claims that Russian money, trolls and internet bots had influenced the result of the 2016 Brexit referendum. In Russia itself, the regime intensified intimidation of independent opposition politicians and media in advance of Putin’s expected re-election bid in March 2018.\nBeset by internal turmoil, Europe paid less attention, and exercised reduced leverage, in crises along its periphery. Relations with Turkey deteriorated amid rows with Erdoğan over human rights. The flow of refugees and economic migrants from Syria and north Africa slowed, due in part to controversial EU-backed measures to contain migrants in camps in Libya. But there were predictions 2018 could bring another big surge. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Refugees and migrants yell for help after their wooden boat capsizes off Lampedusa, Italy. Photograph: Chris McGrath/Getty Images\n\n\nEurope was sidelined as Russia and Iran, bypassing the UN, joined forces to enforce a prospective settlement in Syria keeping Assad in power. Iran’s leading role in the war, expanding influence in Iraq and Lebanon, and support for Houthi rebels in Yemen produced little in the way of an effective response from the west.\nTrump further stirred the pot, and outraged the Palestinians, by recognising disputed and divided Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, and announcing plans to relocate the US embassy there from Tel Aviv. He also made a typically bellicose speech at the UN, threatening to tear up the multinational 2015 nuclear deal with Tehran. It was left to Saudi Arabia, led by Prince Salman, to take concrete steps to challenge Iran’s regional ambitions. But the Saudi-led military intervention in Yemen, notably a blockade of its ports, succeeded only in exacerbating the humanitarian crisis. A convoluted attempt in Lebanon to push back Hezbollah, Iran’s ally, backfired. And Saudi economic and diplomatic sanctions designed to force Qatar to renounce its ties with Iran had the opposite effect. \nAmid all this upheaval, an ill-timed bid by Iraq’s Kurds to create an independent state flopped badly. If anything in the Middle East is predictable, it is growing confrontation in 2018 between Iran and Trump, backed by Israel. \nTerror attacks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Afghan men provide assistance to the wounded at the site of a car bomb attack in Kabul on 31 May 2017. Photograph: Shah Marai/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\nMany pre-existing conflicts and problems persisted or worsened in 2017. Syria’s civil war dragged on remorselessly. Trump launched a one-off missile attack on a suspected chemical weapons store in April, but otherwise ignored the conflict. \nIn Afghanistan, the impact of the insurgency measurably worsened. After 16 years of war, civilian casualties hit record highs, according to UN figures. There was a 43% increase in death and injuries attributable to US and Afghan airstrikes. The Taliban were blamed for two-thirds of the overall total. The Afghan figures reflected a wider trend. Under Trump, the American military has greatly increased its use of armed drones, particularly in Somalia, where they targeted the terror group al-Shabaab.\nThe new tactics did not halt terror attacks. In Mogadishu, hundreds died in a particularly devastating truck bombing in October. In Egypt’s northern Sinai, more than 300 Sufi Muslim worshippers were killed by a group linked to Islamic State. Terrorists also struck countries involved in the international campaign against Isis. Horror came to London, Manchester, Barcelona, Paris, Ankara, Tehran and New York. As Isis was slowly dislodged from its strongholds in Raqqa and Mosul, concern increased that its adherents were regrouping in north Africa or returning to countries of origin in Europe and Asia.\nThe year saw its share of humanitarian disasters, manmade or otherwise. War, famine and disease further devastated South Sudan, while Yemen suffered a similar, wholly avoidable fate. In Myanmar, an army-led campaign of ethnic cleansing displaced huge numbers of Rohingya Muslims, who fled to Bangladesh. The resulting suffering brought fierce criticism of Myanmar’s civilian leader, the Nobel peace prizewinner Aung San Suu Kyi, by those with scant understanding of her limited powers in a country still dominated by generals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Aung San Suu Kyi looks on during the 9th Asean-UN Summit.

An earthquake struck Mexico in September, killing 369 people. To the dismay of campaigners, a study showed that concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere increased at record speeds. Meanwhile, Trump backed out of the 2016 Paris climate change agreement.

The prospects for economically stricken Venezuela were less encouraging. A decision by the embattled socialist president, Nicolás Maduro, to install a political ally as head of the state oil company, PDVSA, encouraged speculation the country’s vital oil exports may fall, driving up world market prices in 2018.\nSouth Africa saw growing anger at the kleptocracy and corruption associated with the ANC presidency of Jacob Zuma.

        "text": "\nHezbollah fighters battling alongside the Assad regime gained ground in a new offensive in one of the last strongholds of moderate rebels in southern Syria – an advance that is likely to alarm Israeli leaders.\nThe fresh assault came as a top US intelligence official warned of an “unprecedented” influx of 20,000 foreign fighters into Syria from over 90 countries, the majority of whom are looking to fight alongside the Islamic State and who pose a risk to their home countries upon their return.\nThe Syrian military confirmed that it began a “broad operation” in the south that had led to advances in the rural areas south-west of Damascus , to the cities of Quneitra and Daraa, regaining control of a number of towns and strategic hilltops from what it described as the “terrorists of the Nusra front”.\nThe military said it will continue operations against “terrorist gangs” – a catch-all term the government uses for rebel fighters.\n“The operation started two days ago and is very big,” Rami Abdulrahman, the head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group, told Reuters on Tuesday.\nSOHR said Hezbollah, backed by fighters from Iran and the Assad regime, took control of the hills of al-Sarja and al-Arous in the south-western countryside of Damascus. Pro-regime forces killed 20 rebel fighters on Tuesday, including eight in an ambush.\nSouthern Syria is one of the last remaining bastions of the moderate opposition, which has been increasingly marginalized by the rise of extremist groups like Islamic State (Isis) and the Nusra Front. \nLast year, the US approved a plan to arm and train moderate rebel groups to help in the fight against Isis. Western states hope the moderate rebels could form a nucleus of opposition to the embattled president.\nIn his statement before the House homeland security committee on Wednesday, the director of the US National Counterterrorism Center, Nicholas Rasmussen, said that of the 20,000 foreign fighters who have travelled to Syria, 3,400 of those are from western countries, including over 150 Americans who either travelled to Syria or attempted to do so. In September, US officials had put the number of Americans fighting with extremist groups in Syria at about two dozen. \nThe Syrian army backed by Hezbollah has been fighting to regain control of territories in the south. Last month, Israel attacked a Hezbollah convoy in Quneitra near the border, killing Jihad Mughniyeh, a party commander, as well as an Iranian general who was in the convoy. Jihad was the son of Imad Mughniyeh, the party’s former military chief who was assassinated in Damascus in 2008.\nJanuary’s attack prompted a Hezbollah response in the Shebaa Farms, a small strip of land occupied by Israel straddling its borders with Lebanon and Syria.\nHezbollah’s advance so close to the Golan Heights, the strategic hilltop overlooking Syria that was seized by Israel in the 1967 war, is likely to alarm Israel. The move would open another front from which Hezbollah could target Israel in the event of renewed conflict.\n"

        "text": "\nJeremy Corbyn’s claim that Labour will not lose seats in Thursday’s local council elections but is instead seeking to make gains was misinterpreted, according to his official spokesman.\n\n\n\n\nLabour will not lose seats in local elections, Jeremy Corbyn says\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe aide said his leader’s comment – “we are not going to lose seats, we are looking to gain seats where we can” – should not be taken as a prediction of what might happen.\nAs the public prepares to vote in Scottish, Welsh and English local elections, the adviser said: “I’m telling you what he intended to say. He was saying we were not in the business of losing seats.”\nIt came amid internal fears inside Labour that the party could be set to lose control of a string of English councils, including Dudley, Redditch, Southampton, Plymouth and Cannock Chase, although there is hope that Sadiq Khan will win the London mayoralty.\nOne source said the worst case scenario was that 10 councils would be lost in the wake of an antisemitism crisis that has gripped the party for over a week and resulted in the suspensions of Naz Shah MP and the former London mayor Ken Livingstone.\nA Labour spokeswoman confirmed that three more activists had been suspended from the party on Wednesday and were facing investigations. That included the vice chair of the South Thanet party, Jackie Walker, who published an online post asking “what debt do we owe the Jews?”\nKezia Dugdale, the Scottish Labour leader, said the furore was damaging the party’s prospects north of the border. “It has unquestionably had an effect,” she said, claiming that the subject was coming up on doorsteps.\nLabour council leaders campaigning hard across southern England told the Guardian that their battles were too close to call. Jon Clempner, Labour leader of Harlow council, said: “To be perfectly frank, it’s going to be very tight [to keep control of the council].” He said Labour campaigners were talking up local issues over national politics and the EU referendum.\nPeter Lamb, the council leader in Crawley, said some believed that Labour risked losing control because it only had a majority of one. However, he suggested it would be devastating for local campaigners if that happened. “Given the history of the seat it would be unprecedented for us to lose control in a year when [the national party is] in opposition,” he said.\nIn Plymouth the council’s leader, Tudor Evans, said the party had had a good election night in 2012 and so was now defending 12 seats. The council is in no overall control but could be taken by the Tories if they win three seats. “It is on a knife edge,” admitted Evans. “It is too close to call.”\nDavid Cameron used his weekly prime minister’s questions on the eve of the elections to challenge Corbyn relentlessly over his links to extremist groups with antisemitic views, calling on him four times to withdraw having once described Hamas and Hezbollah as friends. \nThe prime minister turned the weekly session on its head, ignoring Corbyn’s questions about domestic policy and instead declaring: “Those organisations in their constitutions believe in persecuting and killing Jews, they are antisemitic organisations, they are racist organisations, he must stand up and say they are not his friends.” The prime minister also hit out at Khan, whom he accused of repeatedly sharing platforms with extremists. \nCorbyn strongly defended Khan, whom he said was being smeared, and insisted Labour was an anti-racist party that would not tolerate antisemitism. However he failed to directly withdraw his previous comments about Hamas and Hezbollah. Instead he said that he did not approve of either organisation, adding: “Anyone who commits racist acts or is antisemitic is not a friend of mine.”\nThe controversy could affect the party in the elections, with one poll finding that only 8.5% of British Jews would vote Labour in Thursday’s election. The survey for the Jewish Chronicle found that support has plummeted since last year’s election, when 18% of the paper’s Jewish community said they voted Labour under Ed Miliband’s leadership.\nAlan Johnson, the Labour former home secretary, told the Yorkshire Post he was concerned about the 18 suspensions over allegations of antisemitism.\n“I am worried about it. It’s not my party, it’s not the party I joined … These accusations need to be looked at and the people involved need to be rooted out and to make sure that we are anti-racist in everything we do and that we get rid of any racists [who] we might have [who] infiltrate our ranks. I don’t think it has an impact [on the local elections]. It might have an impact on mayoral elections. I hope not.”\nRobert Hayward, the elections analyst and Conservative peer, said the overall results would be seen through the prism of Labour’s performance. Corbyn will face a barrage of criticism if the party does poorly, with rumours in Westminster that some shadow cabinet members may resign and there could be calls for the leader himself to step down.\n“The risk for the Labour party is that [it] will be almost non-existent in southern England and hit fairly hard in many of its remaining bases in the Midlands,” said Hayward. Some are also warning that Labour could slip into third place in Scotland behind the Tories and slip backwards in Wales.\nHowever, on a more positive note for the Labour party, it is the Conservatives who have come under more pressure than other parties in council by-elections since the start of the year. Analysis by the Press Association finds that the Tories, who have faced controversy themselves over the EU and a budget rebellion, have lost 10 seats in town hall contests, particularly to independents, in recent weeks and have gained only two. In recent weeks, Conservatives have seen losses to independents in council byelections at Allerdale, Craven, East Riding of Yorkshire and North Kesteven.\n"

        "title": "Mohammed bin Salman al-Saud: The young hothead who would be king",
        "date": "2017-06-24T23:05:13Z",
        "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/25/mohammed-bin-salman-saudi-heir-young-hothead-with-ambitions",
        "text": "\nThe sudden elevation of Mohammed bin Salman to the position of crown prince and heir apparent to his father, King Salman of Saudi Arabia, is a welcome surprise for many Saudis. It is also a matter of deep concern for some of the kingdom’s neighbours, notably Iran, which is locked in a region-wide power struggle with its Arab arch-rival that increasingly risks sucking in the US and Russia.\nFor younger Saudis frustrated by the kingdom’s hidebound traditionalism and inflexible religious laws, Prince Mohammed is seen as a reform-minded new broom who could sweep the country to a brighter, more open future. For critics at home and abroad, he is a dangerous and inexperienced firebrand who could undermine stability and lead Saudi Arabia to unintentional disaster.\nThe most unusual aspect of Prince Mohammed’s rise is his age. At 31, he is more than 25 years younger than his discarded predecessor as crown prince, Prince Mohammed bin Nayef. In a country of 31 million where 70% of people are under the age of 30 and which is accustomed to the rule of old men, the new royal heir represents a significant generational power shift.\nThe prince already held key positions in the national hierarchy. Two years ago his father appointed him defence minister and also placed him in overall charge of the country’s oil industry, the font of the kingdom’s wealth. He used his new prominence to boost his profile at home and abroad, apparently intent on clearing a path to the throne. In the process, he earned a reputation as a hawk in matters of national security, especially over the 2015 Saudi armed intervention in Yemen.\nThe king’s decision last week to promote his favourite son again so quickly, placing him first in the line of succession, may reflect his desire to head off a power struggle involving bin Nayef, a respected former interior minister renowned for cracking down on al-Qaida, and his traditionalist supporters. The move has sparked speculation that King Salman, aged 81 and reportedly not in the best of health, may be considering abdication at some future date.\nIn a show of near-unity, King Salman’s edict was endorsed by 31 of 34 members of the Allegiance Council, made up of senior members of the ruling Saud family. In a ceremony in the holy city of Mecca on Wednesday evening, Saudi state television showed royal family members, clerics and officials queuing up to shake hands with the young prince or kiss his shoulder. Mohammed bin Nayef was seen pledging allegiance to Prince Mohammed, who knelt and kissed his older cousin’s hand, saying: “We will not cease taking your guidance and advice.”\nWhile the abrupt transfer of power went smoothly – Iran dubbed it a “soft coup” – there could be rougher times ahead, for there is no doubting Prince Mohammed harbours high ambitions for his country as well as himself.\nSaudi Arabia, an absolute monarchy since the days of its modern-day founder, Abdulaziz al-Saud (Ibn Saud), is often characterised in the west as a backward, inward-looking state, steeped in ultra-conservative Sunni Muslim ideology and outdated social conventions, particularly in its denial of women’s rights. It also stands accused of prime responsibility for the spread of hardline Wahhabi Islamist beliefs that have inspired groups such as the Afghan Taliban, al-Qaida and Islamic State.\nSince emerging from relative obscurity two years ago, Prince Mohammed, widely known by the user-friendly monicker of MbS, has championed social and economic reforms under the catch-all title of Vision 2030. One change was his removal of the power of arrest from the feared religious police. Bloomberg commentator Leonid Bershidsky noted his creation of an Entertainment Authority, which has organised concerts and talks of opening cinemas. “[The authority] has even held a comic book convention at which men and women reportedly danced in the same big hall. Top clerics have been up in arms, but presumably, young people like it,” he said.\nPrince Mohammed has also vowed to diversify the economy, reduce national dependence on oil revenues, and encourage greater entrepreneurship in a country where two-thirds of the workforce is employed by the state. He chairs the supreme board of Aramco, making him the first royal family member to oversee the state oil company directly. A controversial IPO (initial public offering), putting 5% of the company up for sale, is planned next year.\nThe prince’s modernising iconoclasm at home is matched by a determination to transform Saudi Arabia into a pivotal player abroad. His motivation appears twofold: assuming the leadership role in the Sunni Muslim Arab world that Egypt, racked by revolution and counter-revolution, has to some degree forfeited since the Arab spring of 2011; and meeting the expanding challenge posed by Shia Muslim Iran.\nHis defence and foreign policy decisions appear mostly driven by this latter factor. The 2015 military intervention in Yemen’s civil war, with the Saudis at the head of an Arab coalition, came in response to Iran’s support for the Houthi Shia rebels there. The intervention has failed to deter Iran, and has led to large numbers of civilian casualties, serious humanitarian problems and a spreading famine.\nIran’s purported machinations in Bahrain lie behind Saudi support for the policies enacted since 2011 to subdue the country’s restive Shia majority. In Syria, too, the Saudis have taken sides with Sunni Arab militias and Kurdish forces (and western countries) opposed to the Iranian-backed regime of Bashar al-Assad in Damascus. Lebanon, home to Tehran-allied Hezbollah, has also become a virtual battlefield for Prince Mohammed’s proxy war with Iran. Speaking last month, he seemed to be hardening his stance, declaring that dialogue with Tehran was impossible because its Shia-led theocracy wanted to impose its suzerainty over the entire Muslim world, including the holy sites of Mecca and Medina. “We are a primary target for the Iranian regime… We won’t wait for the battle to be in Saudi Arabia. Instead, we’ll work so that the battle is for them in Iran,” he said. Such statements underscore concerns that Prince Mohammed is a hothead who could plunge the region into open conflict. Iran’s leadership is dismissive, with Ayatollah Ali Khamenei describing the prince and his fellow leaders in Riyadh as “idiots”. But hardliners in Iran’s Revolutionary Guard take a harsher line amid loose talk about the inevitability of the coming war with the Saudis.\nLast month’s rupture with Qatar, ostensibly over its alleged support for terrorism, may also be seen in this context. Qatar alone among the Gulf states has maintained reasonably amicable relations with Iran. For Prince Mohammed, this is tantamount to treachery – hence the Saudi mobilisation of Egypt, Bahrain and the UAE in a joint diplomatic and commercial boycott. As with his Yemeni misadventure, the counter-productive result, so far, has been a deepening of Iran’s involvement and leverage.\nPrince Mohammed may be inexperienced, but his political instincts are sharp. Using his platform as deputy crown prince and defence minister, he travelled in recent months to the US, Russia and China, getting himself known and arguing his case with the world’s most powerful leaders.\nIn Donald Trump, the prince has an eager audience when it comes to talking up the Iranian threat. During his visit to Riyadh last month, Trump denounced the Tehran regime and called for its international isolation. The US president remains committed to tearing up the nuclear deal with Iran signed by Barack Obama and the EU two years ago. The US is imposing new sanctions even as it provocatively furnishes the Saudis with up to $110bn (£86bn) worth of state of the art weaponry.\nTrump’s designation of Iran as the world’s foremost sponsor of terrorism, and his intimations about the possible use of force, are wholly in line with Prince Mohammed’s thinking. This has led to speculation, for example, that the Saudis and Israelis may concoct a Palestinian “peace” agreement, under US auspices, on the way to forming a united front against Iran. Jared Kushner, Trump’s envoy, was in Israel last week exploring some kind of deal.\nIt is at this point that Prince Mohammed’s overweening ambitions cease to be of merely local interest and become truly dangerous, internationally speaking. Russia has hitherto sought good relations with the Saudis. But its overriding Middle East priority is Assad’s survival in Syria, and to that end, Iran is key. A strengthening, increasingly bellicose US-Saudi-Israel alliance would certainly produce a reaction in Moscow – and that reaction could include getting ever closer to Iran in the Near East, in the Gulf, and in central Asia and Afghanistan. Nor will Iran stand idly by as hostility increases.\nPresident Trump and Prince Mohammed – the old fraudster and the young hothead. It is an unsettling combination whose possible consequences are greatly to be feared.\nTHE AL-SAUD FILE\nBorn Mohammed bin Salman al-Saud on 31 August 1985 , in Jeddah. He is the son of King Salman from his third spouse, Fahda bint Falah bin Sultan bin Hathleen. He studied law at King Saud University.\nBest of times Since he entered politics in 2009 as a special adviser to his father, his rise has been meteoric. In January 2015 his father became king, and he was appointed the world’s youngest minister of defence, before last week becoming Saudi Arabia’s new crown prince.\nWorst of times On 24 September 2015 over 2,000 Hajj pilgrims were suffocated, or crushed during the annual Hajji pilgrimage in Mina, Mecca. Some claimed this was due to attempts by the personal convoy of Mohammed bin Salman to force itself through the crowd, as well as several road closures in the area.\nWhat others say “Today, foreign policy, defence matters, and issues of social change are all under Prince Mohammed’s control.” – Mohammed Alyahya, a non-resident fellow at the Atlantic Council\nWhat he says “A war between Saudi Arabia and Iran is the beginning of a major catastrophe in the region, and it will reflect very strongly on the rest of the world. For sure we will not allow any such thing.”\n"

        "text": "\nThe UN and Turkey are seeking security guarantees before sending aid convoys into Aleppo after a shaky start to a ceasefire across Syria that observers say is starting to take hold.\nThe deal, brokered by Russia and the US, is expected to clear the way for humanitarian deliveries to many of the 18 besieged areas across the country by grounding the Russian and Syrian air forces and calling on opposition groups to lower their weapons.\nDespite widespread scepticism in the runup to the truce, which began at sunset on Monday, most rebel groups appear to have grudgingly backed the agreement, which diplomats have suggested could be a first step towards a more lasting peace after five years of war that has left much of the country in ruin.\n\n\n\n\nSyrian ceasefire deal - the Guardian briefing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a group that monitors the conflict, updated its tally of fatalities. The SOHR said its records show that since the crisis began in March 2011 more than 301,000 people have been killed, 86,000 of them civilians. \nIt said the actual figure might be 70,000 higher, as insurgent groups do not announce their deaths and there are other deaths that are not documented. The UN previously suggested the toll may be as high as 400,000, but officials stopped counting in August last year.\nTurkish reports said 40 trucks were due to cross the border into Syria late on Tuesday, carrying food, clothing and children’s toys. Much of the aid was destined for rebel-held eastern Aleppo, which has been largely besieged by the Bashar al-Assad regime for the past two months. The northern entrance to the city was bombed from the air shortly after the ceasefire began and remains one of the most bitterly contested parts of the country.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Picture released by Syrian state media on Monday shows Bashar al-Assad speaking with press in Daraya. Photograph: HO/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\nControl of Aleppo remains central to the conflict and to the fate of the ceasefire. On the opposition side, rebel groups have blended with Islamist groups and jihadis, such as Jabhat Fatah al-Sham – the rebranded Jabhat al-Nusra – to defend the city. On the other, Iranian-backed Shia militias and Hezbollah, supported by the Syrian army, are battling to take it from them.\nJabhat Fatah al-Sham released a statement on Tuesday criticising the deal, which excluded the group and stated that it remains a valid target for Russian and US jets. A critical theme of the deal was to isolate jihadis from more mainstream groups. The latter have been reluctant to disentangle themselves from jihadi groups, who have acted as guarantors in the face of relentless attacks from Russian and Syrian aircraft over the past year.\nRebel leaders in Aleppo told the Observer at the weekend that they did not support the jihadis’ ideology or vision for Syria, but had no other option than to accept them as part of the opposition scene, particularly around Aleppo and Idlib province.\nIf the truce holds, Russia and the US say they plan to open a joint operations room within seven days, which would precisely map out areas that remain valid targets.\n"

I think the difference between Hamas and Hezbollah is significant.”\nWith the CNN anchor Dana Bash, Hewitt will ask questions in the second GOP debate, which takes place in Nevada on 16 September.

Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi … are we talking about Nasrallah or Hezbollah, are we talking about the guy running Hamas, it’s easy to get confused.”\nSaying “I got my Donald Trump tattoo” and promising not to be biased against him in the debate, as some conservative outlets charge that he will be, Hewitt added: “So he didn’t like some questions, he liked some questions, he took a shot at me, that’s fine. \n“I tell people I’m not perfect.

If he passes that basic knowledge test – and there’s about a 0% chance he will pass that test – move on to more specific questions.\nWhen radio talkshow host Hugh Hewitt put Trump to a test like this back in September – Hewitt is perhaps the only one in the media to pose such questions to Trump thus far – The Donald failed miserably.\n“I will when it’s appropriate,” Trump sputtered when Hewitt asked him whether it is important if he knows the difference between the terror groups Hamas and Hezbollah. “I will know more about it than you know, and believe me, it won’t take me long.”\nNone of this is to say a candidate who can write a detailed essay on the founding of Isis – or a critique of America’s handling of the Syrian civil war – is destined to become a great foreign policy president. Hillary Clinton could probably answer all the aforementioned questions, and her foreign policy track record is terrible. Trump is right to point out that judgment matters in this arena too, as he usually does when pressed on his lack of actual foreign policy experience. But before an American president can exercise judgment, there is a basic knowledge threshold that has to be met.\nTrump clearly doesn’t meet that threshold. Even worse, there’s little evidence he is even trying to close his knowledge gap.\n"

        "text": "\nFacebook put the safety of its content moderators at risk after inadvertently exposing their personal details to suspected terrorist users of the social network, the Guardian has learned.\n\n\n\n\nRevealed: Facebook's internal rulebook on sex, terrorism and violence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe security lapse affected more than 1,000 workers across 22 departments at Facebook who used the company’s moderation software to review and remove inappropriate content from the platform, including sexual material, hate speech and terrorist propaganda. \nA bug in the software, discovered late last year, resulted in the personal profiles of content moderators automatically appearing as notifications in the activity log of the Facebook groups, whose administrators were removed from the platform for breaching the terms of service. The personal details of Facebook moderators were then viewable to the remaining admins of the group.\nOf the 1,000 affected workers, around 40 worked in a counter-terrorism unit based at Facebook’s European headquarters in Dublin, Ireland. Six of those were assessed to be “high priority” victims of the mistake after Facebook concluded their personal profiles were likely viewed by potential terrorists.\nThe Guardian spoke to one of the six, who did not wish to be named out of concern for his and his family’s safety. The Iraqi-born Irish citizen, who is in his early twenties, fled Ireland and went into hiding after discovering that seven individuals associated with a suspected terrorist group he banned from Facebook – an Egypt-based group that backed Hamas and, he said, had members who were Islamic State sympathizers – had viewed his personal profile.\nFacebook confirmed the security breach in a statement and said it had made technical changes to “better detect and prevent these types of issues from occurring”.\n“We care deeply about keeping everyone who works for Facebook safe,” a spokesman said. “As soon as we learned about the issue, we fixed it and began a thorough investigation to learn as much as possible about what happened.”\nThe moderator who went into hiding was among hundreds of “community operations analysts” contracted by global outsourcing company Cpl Recruitment. Community operations analysts are typically low-paid contractors tasked with policing Facebook for content that breaches its community standards.\nOverwhelmed with fear that he could face retaliation, the moderator, who first came to Ireland as an asylum seeker when he was a child, quit his job and moved to eastern Europe for five months. \n\n\n\n\n \n\nThe punishment from Isis for working in counter-terrorism is beheading. All they’d need to do is tell someone\n\n\n\n\n\n“It was getting too dangerous to stay in Dublin,” he said, explaining that his family had already experienced the horrifying impact of terrorism: his father had been kidnapped and beaten and his uncle executed in Iraq.\n“The only reason we’re in Ireland was to escape terrorism and threats,” he said.\nThe moderator said that others within the high-risk six had their personal profiles viewed by accounts with ties to Isis, Hezbollah and the Kurdistan Workers Party. Facebook complies with the US state department’s designation of terrorist groups.\n“When you come from a war zone and you have people like that knowing your family name you know that people get butchered for that,” he said. “The punishment from Isis for working in counter-terrorism is beheading. All they’d need to do is tell someone who is radical here.”\nFacebook moderators like him first suspected there was a problem when they started receiving friend requests from people affiliated with the terrorist organizations they were scrutinizing.\nAn urgent investigation by Facebook’s security team established that personal profiles belonging to content moderators had been exposed. As soon as the leak was identified in November 2016, Facebook convened a “task force of data scientists, community operations and security investigators”, according to internal emails seen by the Guardian, and warned all the employees and contracted staff it believed were affected. The company also set-up an email address, nameleak@fb.com, to field queries from those affected.\n\n\n\n\nUnderpaid and overburdened: the life of a Facebook moderator\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook then discovered that the personal Facebook profiles of its moderators had been automatically appearing in the activity logs of the groups they were shutting down. \nCraig D’Souza, Facebook’s head of global investigations, liaised directly with some of the affected contractors, talking to the six individuals considered to be at the highest risk over video conference, email and Facebook Messenger.\nIn one exchange, before the Facebook investigation was complete, D’Souza sought to reassure the moderators that there was “a good chance” any suspected terrorists notified about their identity would fail to connect the dots. \n“Keep in mind that when the person sees your name on the list, it was in their activity log, which contains a lot of information,” D’Souza wrote, “there is a good chance that they associate you with another admin of the group or a hacker ...”\n“I understand Craig,” replied the moderator who ended up fleeing Ireland, “but this is taking chances. I’m not waiting for a pipe bomb to be mailed to my address until Facebook does something about it.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg delivers a keynote address. Six moderators were assessed as ‘high priority’ victims of a mistake that shared their personal details with extremist groups. Photograph: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\n\nThe bug in the software was not fixed for another two weeks, on 16 November 2016. By that point the glitch had been active for a month. However, the bug was also retroactively exposing the personal profiles of moderators who had censored accounts as far back as August 2016. \nFacebook offered to install a home alarm monitoring system and provide transport to and from work to those in the high risk group. The company also offered counseling through Facebook’s employee assistance program, over and above counseling offered by the contractor, Cpl.\nThe moderator who fled Ireland was unsatisfied with the security assurances received from Facebook. In an email to D’Souza, he wrote that the high-risk six had spent weeks “in a state of panic and emergency” and that Facebook needed to do more to “address our pressing concerns for our safety and our families”. \nHe told the Guardian that the five months he spent in eastern Europe felt like “exile”. He kept a low profile, relying on savings to support himself. He spent his time keeping fit and liaising with his lawyer and the Dublin police, who checked up on his family while he was away. He returned to Ireland last month after running out of money, although he still lives in fear.\n\n\n\n\nMove fast, Zuckerberg, or hate will kill Facebook | John Naughton\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“I don’t have a job, I have anxiety and I’m on antidepressants,” he said. “I can’t walk anywhere without looking back.”\nThis month he filed a legal claim against Facebook and Cpl with the Injuries Board in Dublin. He is seeking compensation for the psychological damage caused by the leak.\nCpl did not respond to a request to comment. The statement provided by Facebook said its investigation sought to determine “exactly which names were possibly viewed and by whom, as well as an assessment of the risk to the affected person”. \nThe social media giant played down the threat posed to the affected moderators, but said that it contacted each of them individually “to offer support, answer their questions, and take meaningful steps to ensure their safety”.\n“Our investigation found that only a small fraction of the names were likely viewed, and we never had evidence of any threat to the people impacted or their families as a result of this matter,” the spokesman said.\nDetails of Facebook’s security blunder will once again put a spotlight on the grueling and controversial work carried out by an army of thousands of low-paid staff, including in countries like the Philippines and India.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n \nThe Facebook Files: sex, violence and hate speech\n\n\nThe Guardian recently revealed the secret rules and guidelines Facebook uses to train moderators to police its vast network of almost two billion users, including 100 internal training manuals, spreadsheets and flowcharts. \nThe moderator who fled Ireland worked for a 40-strong specialist team tasked with investigating reports of terrorist activity on Facebook. He was hired because he spoke Arabic, he said. \n\n\n\n\n \n\nThey should have let us use fake profiles. They never warned us that something like ​​this could happen\n\n\nHe felt that contracted staff were not treated as equals to Facebook employees but “second-class citizens”. He was paid just €13 ($15) per hour for a role that required him to develop specialist knowledge of global terror networks and scour through often highly-disturbing material.\n“You come in every morning and just look at beheadings, people getting butchered, stoned, executed,” he said. \nFacebook’s policies allow users to post extremely violent images provided they don’t promote or celebrate terrorism. This means moderators may be repeatedly exposed to the same haunting pictures to determine whether the people sharing them were condemning or celebrating the depicted acts. \n The moderator said that when he started, he was given just two weeks training and was required to use his personal Facebook account to log into the social media giant’s moderation system.\n“They should have let us use fake profiles,” he said, adding: “They never warned us that something like this could happen.”\n\n\n\n\nHow Facebook guides moderators on terrorist content\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook told the Guardian that as a result of the leak it is testing the use of administrative accounts that are not linked to personal profiles. \nModeration teams were continually scored for the accuracy and speed of their decisions, he said, as well as other factors such as their ability to stay updated training materials. If a moderator’s score dropped below 90% they would receive a formal warning.\nIn an attempt to boost morale among agency staff, Facebook launched a monthly award ceremony to celebrate the top quality performers. The prize was a Facebook-branded mug. “The mug that all Facebook employees get,” he noted.\nContact the author: olivia.solon@theguardian.com \n"

        "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/sep/13/hugh-hewitt-donald-trump-interview-republican-debate",
        "text": "\nIn a trendy exposed-brick studio – fake bookcases, a backless chair with comfy cushions, a printed backdrop of the glittering Denver skyline behind it – Hugh Hewitt experienced a rare moment of near-exasperation on Tuesday.\nHe was watching CNN, on which he was to imminently appear, as the network’s anchor Don Lemon teased an interview with the American conservative’s interviewer of choice: “Coming up, the man who stumped Trump.” \n“I did not stump Trump,” the man muttered.\nHewitt is now the most influential conservative journalist in Republican presidential politics, the thinking candidate’s Rush Limbaugh and the brain to Matt Drudge’s secretive brawn. \nA Richard Nixon protégé who served for six years in the Reagan administration, the 59-year-old presents a syndicated radio show, broadcast on nearly 100 stations from Los Angeles and Phoenix to Denver and DC, that has become the destination for Republican politicians seeking a fair hearing. \nThe expositions are not, as both Donald Trump and Hugh Hewitt discovered with the foreign-policy pop quiz heard ’round the world, easy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\nSince last month’s first of 12 debates scheduled by the party and its now merely 16 candidates for president of the United States, Hewitt has quizzed every one of them, in nearly 40 confrontations.\nHewitt will appear on CNN again this Wednesday, as co-host of the second Republican primary debate with the network’s Jake Tapper. His responsibility will be to ask difficult questions, which partly explains why Hewitt remains mildly frustrated that his counterparts in the media have concentrated on accusations of “gotcha” journalism leveled at him by the man currently leading the primary field.\nOn 3 September, hours after Trump signed a pledge promising to run as a Republican or not at all, his interview on Hewitt’s show took a difficult turn: Trump said the difference between Hezbollah and Hamas would matter to him “when it’s appropriate”, after mistaking “Quds”, the Iranian special forces brigade, for “Kurds”. The candidate was rattled, insisting people like Qassem Soleimani – who has run the Quds force since 1998 – would “all be gone” by the time he reached the Oval Office anyhow.\n\n\n\n\nDonald Trump: I will know the difference between Hamas and Hezbollah 'when it's appropriate'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“That is a gotcha question, though,” Trump told Hewitt. “I mean, you know, when you’re asking me about who’s running this, this this, that’s not, that is not.”\nLater, Trump took to MSNBC to call Hewitt a “third-rate radio announcer”. The rightwing news site Breitbart called him “establishment”. Fox News contributor Geraldo Rivera said his questions had indeed been of the “gotcha” variety.\nHewitt didn’t mind a bit. \nDuring a series of interviews over two days last week inside his temporary studio in Lakewood, Colorado, where he has been teaching at Colorado Christian University, Hewitt told the Guardian that of the roughly 25,000 interviews he had conducted in his 15-year radio career, he could count the ones that had escalated to “angry” on a single hand. \nTrump, Hewitt said with a generous glimmer, is “the best interview in America”.\nHe denied that he was bothered by the process of receiving his “Trump tattoo”; the candidate’s mistake, he said, was simply a matter of mishearing. As for the blowback from inside the rightwing media: “Breitbart does not bother me in the least. Geraldo calling me a gotcha journalist, that does not bother me in the least.”\nWhat does it mean to be a conservative talk-radio influencer in the age of Trump? Those better known to liberals than Hewitt are bombastic personalities – Limbaugh, Glenn Beck, Sean Hannity. Has their influence, on and off Fox News, led candidates on the right to mirror them? Did Fox and its friends beget the Donald show?\nWhen asked gotcha questions of himself, Hewitt defers to history without being totally demure. \n“Teddy Roosevelt turned politics into entertainment,” said the interviewer, not quite winking from behind his thick black glasses.\n‘It’s not about us’\nTo his guests and their operatives, the Hewitt gauntlet is a welcome reprieve from the noise of nonstop campaigning – Trump and three other candidates shared space at a football tailgate on Saturday – and a chance to actually look in the mirror, when Trump is conducting fake interviews with himself in the mirror on the Tonight Show.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\nJohn Weaver, a longtime political consultant who helped run presidential campaigns for John McCain and Jon Huntsman and now works as senior strategist for Ohio governor and surging Republican candidate John Kasich, put Hewitt one notch higher, saying that “in the hierarchy of conservative thought-leaders, he is a grown-up”.\n“He’s easy to work with, but that doesn’t mean he doesn’t ask tough questions, insightful questions, to put you on the spot,” Weaver told the Guardian. “Those are the kind of questions he asks in all his interviews.” \nHowever, the Trump foreign policy debacle has led Hewitt to rethink his approach. He said that in his questions at the Reagan library on Wednesday he now planned to “state who the person is – don’t make anyone guess”.\nHewitt is planning to avoid long, involved questions for Trump and anybody else. “In the first debate, the moderators spoke for 34 minutes – that’s too much time,” he told the Guardian. “My ideal is nobody’s talking about me on Thursday.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Hewitt interviews Donald Rumsfeld at Richard Nixon’s library in Yorba Linda, California, which he helped the former president build. Photograph: Kevin Sullivan/Alamy\n\n\n“I don’t want to tip my hand with any questions that … they can read and then get ready for,” he said. “But what I have made a habit of doing with everyone is asking: what will you do about Iran? What are you going to do about Libya, which is becoming as bad as Syria? What I want to do is ask questions that will allow the candidates to talk to each other.”\nCNN had made an editorial decision, he said, to not “step on” actual debate itself, with which Hewitt agrees. “It’s not about us,” he said.\n‘I’m a Nixonian’\nHewitt was born in Warren, Ohio, to a mixed Catholic-Presbyterian family. He still holds that dual faith, attending Roman Catholic mass on Saturday nights, then evangelical Protestant church on Sundays. \n(Despite his devout faith, he was a close friend of the late atheist polemicist and author Christopher Hitchens, who appeared on Hewitt’s show 70 times. “He loved the conversation,” Hewitt said.)\nHe attended John F Kennedy Catholic school – whose other luminous alumni include Fox News chief Roger Ailes and Foo Fighters frontman Dave Grohl – then went to Harvard, where Doris Kearns Goodwin was his first professor. \nHewitt’s roommates in Cambridge during the Gerald Ford administration were Mark Gearan, who later became Bill Clinton’s deputy chief of staff, and Daniel Poneman, who would later serve as Barack Obama’s deputy energy secretary. They remain his close friends today.\n“My friends have always been wrong,” he said of their Democratic leanings, “but I love them.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Once David Frost left the Nixon estate in California, a young Hewitt started working there as an editorial assistant to the former president. Photograph: AP\n\n\nAfter Harvard, Hewitt took a job with David Eisenhower working on a book about David’s grandfather, the former president, before getting a call from David’s father-in-law: Nixon, the most recent former president.\nThe young Republican drove cross-country in his Dodge Dart to Nixon’s estate in Monarch Bay, California, site of the David Frost interrogation, where he worked closely for more than two years as editorial assistant to his “great mentor”.\n “That’s why I’m an internationalist,” Hewitt said. “Because I’m a Nixonian.”\nAfter attending the University of Michigan Law School, he moved to Washington to clerk on the DC circuit court, then entered the Reagan administration – thanks, Hewitt suspects, to a recommendation from Nixon himself. \nFive years later, following stints in the White House Counsel’s office, Hewitt returned to California to direct the construction of Nixon’s presidential library in Yorba Linda. “You don’t say no to the guy who made your bones,” he said.\nIt was back west where he started broadcasting, when a producer from a local station who had listened to the presidential ghostwriter and legal whisperer at press conferences decided he “had radio pipes”. \nWhen a foray into TV with PBS didn’t stick, the Salem Radio Network asked Hewitt if he wanted his own syndicated daily radio show.\nSoon enough, he was broadcasting live on the morning of 9/11. \nHe recalled striving to “to try not to panic people, but to relay the news”. \nHe also recalled misreporting the number of dead in New York.\n‘An interviewer, not a monologuist’\nHewitt has spent part of the summer teaching undergraduates to read Winston Churchill, leading a seminar billed as training young Americans “to do your part in keeping our country great”. In this, it matches Trump’s slogan of “Make America Great Again!”, which echoes Reagan word for word.\nHis temporary Colorado studio overlooks a vast domed new-age church, which looks like someone sank the Death Star two-thirds into the earth, except that it gleams whiter than a Kennedy’s tooth. In this, it matches Hewitt’s hair. \nHis professorial manner is immediately belied by his voice, loud and authoritative, which slices the air even more in person.\nYet Hewitt distinguishes himself from louder drive-time influence jockeys like Limbaugh or Beck: without naming either competitor directly, he refers to himself as “an interviewer, not a monologuist”.\n“The point about talk radio that many people don’t understand: they think it’s just screaming, yelling, emotional, when in fact I believe it’s educational, informative and persuasive if done well,” he said between recording sessions.\nHis interview manner is just shy of prosecutorial: unhurried but pressing, and peppered with legal knowledge. His conversations, on air and off, include book recommendations across the political spectrum. He loves fantasy fiction, too: he has read all of George RR Martin’s A Song of Ice and Fire – the Game of Thrones theme is currently his show’s introductory music – and is currently listening to an audiobook of the less well known Wheel of Time series.\nHewitt said he had only been nervous in his career two times.\nThe first was leading up to an appearance on Stephen Colbert’s show because, he said: “Who knows what’s going to happen?” He said Colbert, even before ditching his bombastic conservative persona to replace David Letterman last week, was an “incredibly generous” interviewer.\nThe other time Hugh Hewitt felt fear was before interviewing not a politician but an entertainer: Julie Andrews. “That scared the living daylights out of me,” he said. “It’s Mary Poppins.”\nTrump and the primetime presidential debate will not make three.\n"

        "text": "\nIsrael was apparently unaware an Iranian general was travelling in a Hezbollah convoy it targeted with an air strike in Syria on Sunday, killing the general as well as a senior Hezbollah commander.\nThe claim – made by an unnamed senior Israeli security source in an interview with Reuters on Tuesday – came as Iran threatened to retaliate for the killing and amid growing concern about the security situation on Israel’s northern border with Lebanon and Syria.\nAlthough Israel has not officially confirmed it carried out the strike on a convoy of several cars near the Syrian border village of Quneitra, it has been widely assumed that Israel was behind the attack.\nUN observers on the border also reported seeing Israeli drones in the vicinity before the attack.\nAccording to the source – quoted by the news agency – Israel’s armed forces believed it was targeting a group of relatively low-level members of the Lebanese Shia organisation which has been fighting alongside the government forces of Syria’s Bashar al-Assad.\nThe comments came as Israel’s security cabinet was due to meet and amid indications that Israel was trying to limit the fallout from the killing of Iranian Revolutionary Guard General Mohammed Allahdadi.\nSpeculation has been rife since the killing about why Allahdadi was on the border to close to Israel, with some reports claiming he had been tasked with overseeing new missile locations for Hezbollah.\n“We did not expect the outcome in terms of the stature of those killed – certainly not the Iranian general,” the source said. “We thought we were hitting an enemy field unit that was on its way to carry out an attack on us at the frontier fence.”\n“We got the alert, we spotted the vehicle, identified it was an enemy vehicle and took the shot. We saw this as a limited tactical operation.”\nThe assumption in Israeli security circles is that retaliation of some kind is likely – and would probably be carried out by Hezbollah.\nIsrael has boosted deployment of its “Iron Dome” anti-missile aerial defence system along its northern frontier, which borders Lebanon and Syria, and has increased surveillance activities in the area.\n“They are almost certain to respond,” added the source. “We are anticipating that, but I think it’s a fair assumption that a major escalation is not in the interest of either side.”\nAllahdadi was killed with a Hezbollah commander and the son of the group’s late military leader, Imad Moughniyeh, in Sunday’s attack on a convoy near the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.\nThe sense of tension following the air strike was underlined by comments made by Iranian Revolutionary Guards’ head, General Mohammad Ali Jafari, on Tuesday, who was quoted by Fars news agency warning of retaliation.\n“These martyrdoms proved the need to stick with jihad. The Zionists must await ruinous thunderbolts. The Revolutionary Guards will fight to the end of the Zionist regime … We will not rest easy until this epitome of vice is totally deleted from the region’s geopolitics.”\nThe aftermath of the air strike has attracted mixed commentary in Israel. Security sources believe Hezbollah’s entanglement in Syria on the regime’s side makes it unlikely that it will want escalate the confrontation to a repeat of the full-blown war Hezbollah and Israel fought in 2006.\nAsked about the death of Allahdadi Yaakov Amidror, former head of Israel’s National Security Council said: “The fact that a senior Iranian is involved, who was involved in planning actions against Israel, is on the benefit side. The presence of a senior Iranian must also come up on the price side. And if his presence was known to the decision-makers, this should have been on the table as part of the problem.”\n"

        "text": "\nKnow this: the difference between Hezbollah and Hamas is one of Donald Trump’s known unknowns. Whether it was an unknown unknown 48 hours ago is unclear, but all you need to know is that the US presidential hopeful has now declared he will know it “when it is appropriate”. Given that it would probably be an eeny-meeny-miny-moe situation before he decides which of the two countries to bomb, the pair of them can probably live with their own Z-listery for now.\nOr are Hamas and Hezbollah not, like, countries? Not even Hugh Hewitt – the conservative talkshow host who asked Trump to name the two leaders of these militant whatever-they-ares – dared to ask the Republican frontrunner that one. Like the death of that Spinal Tap drummer, perhaps, some things are “best left unsolved”.\nFor his part, Trump professed distaste for “gotcha questions”. As well he might. If knowledge were power, the only thing he’d be running is a fever.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n \nVideo: Donald Trump says knowing the difference between Hamas and Hezbollah doesn’t matter at the moment, adding he will know ‘when it’s appropriate’\n\n\nMore shamefully – and Trump does not feel shame, which is a genuine superpower for real-life humans – I have to admit that part of me secretly hates politicians being asked gotcha question as well. Not all of me: a significant percentage feels that delicious rush of schadenfreude when one of them thinks Africa is a country, or can’t name a single novel, or something.\nBut there are many times when the embarrassment is just too great. Not Trump’s embarrassment. As I say, so radioactive is his self-confidence that the embarrassment is not his at all. But the vicarious embarrassment, or the sheer excruciating awkwardness of it all, can feel unpleasantly overwhelming for the beholder. I know a lot of people who get this way about Borat, and who – when Sacha Baron Cohen’s creation is at his most horrifyingly revealing of an interviewee – actually have to leave the room or bury their head in a pillow until it lets up a bit.\nObviously, I think white supremacists should be exposed as idiots. And obviously, I think Donald Trump ought not to be within bluffing distance of Middle Eastern politics. But sometimes the reality is a little too rich for the blood. Take Sarah Palin. Clearly, Madam was horrifyingly entertaining on one level. But I was able to enjoy Tina Fey’s version of her rather more for its being at one remove.\nQuite how much reality you can bear is a matter of personal taste and fortitude. And it can, as we know, get very real. George W Bush started two major wars – and I still have no clue if he ever found out the answer to the Hamas/Hezbollah question.\nThe one indication we have on his thinking was an overheard microphone moment at the G8 in 2006, when he outlined his diplomatic vision for Lebanon. “What they need to do,” he explained to Tony Blair, “is get Syria to get Hezbollah to stop doing this shit”. I remember reading that at the time and thinking: Jesus, is that it? Is that how this stuff gets fixed? (A question to which the answer, if the intervening years in the region are any indicator, is a resounding no.)\n\n\n\n\n \n\nYou’d have hoped that America would have had a bit more to go on than body language\n\n\nIt was the same soon after that, when Bush held a dinner at the White House for Hamid Karzai and Pervez Musharraf. Remember: to Bush, Musharraf was like that fact you’ve been told a thousand times but just can’t keep a hold of. (Please don’t picture the Bush memory palace as an outhouse with a single swinging lightbulb. I’m pretty sure there was a backroom of some sort.) The first sight of the lacuna came before he was elected, when an interviewer asked him to name the leader of Pakistan. “The General,” Bush squirmed. Pressed on a name he could only flounder, with that poker tell of a smirk: “We just call him the General.”\nBy the time he was inviting whatsisname to dinner, though, and tensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan were at their most dangerous pitch for some time, Bush had found a different way to be across things. “It’ll be interesting for me,” the American president explained to reporters, “to watch the body language of these two leaders to determine how tense these things are.”\nWait! The body language? Or rather, Dubya’s reading of said body language? Look, I have no wish to discredit body language, that rigorous modern science, which is largely practised by self-styled experts in the Daily Mail attempting to divine the state of a celebrity couple’s marriage from a single red-carpet photo.But you’d have hoped that at that stage in the rolling crapstorm of its early 21st-century foreign policy America would have had a bit more to go on than that. I understand it still retained a state department, for instance, and the CIA.\nStill, the fact that body language was our best lead certainly explains a lot of what came after. (That said, perhaps I am being unfair. Collectors of historical trivia may care to know that the official White House menu for that night listed one of the courses as “fondue”; and if there is a dish on this Earth more set up for examining the aggressively complex political dynamics of the various skewer-holders, then I should like to hear of it.)\nAs for the rest of us, perhaps the virulence of our reaction to high-profile incidents of cluelessness is a poker tell itself. The best comedy of embarrassment mocks deficiencies we like to think we are above but which we have not, perhaps, entirely eradicated. One of the reasons The Office was so brilliant and near the knuckle was that David Brent’s blundering on issues such as race was a grotesque version of the clumsiness many of us are capable of in smaller ways, and wish to God we weren’t.\nIs there not something of this in the glee with which many have set upon Trump’s ignorance? How many of those crowing would have been able to name the leaders of Hamas and Hezbollah, had you whipped their internet-enabled devices away from them the second they found out he couldn’t?\nOf course, they are not running to be leader of the free world (though not so as you’d know it from the self-regard of most social media accounts). But perhaps the virulence of the attack suggests a certain self-defence. Indeed, given that I have just written an entire column on the subject, I assume you have already divined that, in a spot quiz, I could have named the leader of Hamas but not of Hezbollah.\n"

        "text": "\nThe far left’s ideology is not “leftwing” in any sense that a socialist from the 19th or 20th centuries would have understood. It is simply opposition to the west whatever the west does. Occidentalism explains the appearances of Labour’s leaders on Iran’s propaganda channels , the endorsements of Russian imperialism, and the silence that greets the Syrian massacres.\nThere is no secret about the nihilism and double standards. Both have been obvious to me at any rate since the bulk of the left failed to show solidarity with the victims of Saddam Hussein in the Iraq war of 2003 . Nor does the far left, if we can call it a left, try to hide its prejudices. When asked why the streets of London were not heaving with demonstrators protesting against Russia turning Aleppo into the Guernica of our times, Stop the War replied that it had no wish to add to the “jingoism” politicians were whipping up against plucky little Russia. The left’s task was “to oppose the west”. That was all.\nI have criticised the hollowed-out leftism of the 21st century many times, and could fulminate about how no one has yet provided a satisfactory answer to the question: why is it “leftwing” to support the gangster-capitalist Russian state?\nI could note that the mainstream media has not realised that British Islam is overwhelmingly Sunni, but its supposed defenders on the “left” are now allied with Putin, Assad and the Iranian and Hezbollah death squads – the Shia side in the Sunni/Shia religious war, in other words.\nBut let me be generous instead. Jeremy Corbyn does not often give me the chance to defend him, and it is therefore all the more of a pleasure to redress the imbalance today. When his supporters say he is consistent, they are telling the truth. His illiberal worldview is entirely coherent. The trouble is, it is wholly despicable, and provokes the troubling question whether it is so different from the worldview of the west’s “respectable” leaders.\nThere have been repeated opportunities for Barack Obama to take a lead on Syria. The Syrian revolution was political, rather than sectarian, in its initial stages, but he looked away. He might have responded when Assad imitated Saddam and used chemical weapons against civilians, or raised the conscience of the world when Islamic state engaged in the industrial-scale rape of Yazidi women.\nAs it was, the practical effect of Nato policy has been to give Russia a free pass, as Corbyn does.\nSuppose western leaders called Russia’s bluff and insisted on a no-fly zone over Aleppo and a safe haven in northern Syria for refugees. I think you can imagine the reaction. I am very uncomfortable with the term “far left” for many reasons, not the smallest being that Corbynism is not an alien ideology that appeared from the fringe, but a grotesque version of the worst prejudices of polite society.\nIn the last decade, mainstream liberals were just as likely as post-socialist tyrannophiles to tell you that the west was the source of the world’s ills. Those who disagreed were browbeaten with accusations that they were neo-cons, Zionists, warmongers, supporters of torture in Abu Ghraib and so on. Propaganda techniques allowed the mainstream to assure itself that criticism of its orthodoxies was driven by the lowest of motives; a myopic certainty that stopped it seeing sinister movements in the British left that were in front of its nose, let alone sinister movements in the rest of the world. People complaining about Stop the War failing to organise demonstrations against Russia should ask why Amnesty International and other liberal organisations don’t mount them instead. Obama and European leaders must have known that, after Iraq, opposition to intervention in Syria would have come from all quarters: from the far left, from liberal opinion, and from a right wing that is increasingly nationalist and isolationist.\nThe sympathy shown for Putin by Corbyn and Jill Stein, the American Greens’ presidential candidate, is all the more shameful because Donald Trump is an admirer of Putin, as is Marine le Pen’s National Front and the leaders of Europe’s other far-right parties. The very people Corbyn and Stein condemn at home for their racism, they tacitly endorse abroad. As I said earlier, there is an “L”-shaped hole where the left should be. But in terms of practical politics it is clear that whatever label people slap on themselves, their similarities are more striking than their differences.\nFrom the president of the United States, via the liberal left and nationalist right, to you and me, are we all Jeremy Corbyn now? When we turn off the pictures from Aleppo and look in the mirror, do we see the blandly wicked features of the Labour leader gazing back at us?\nShiraz Maher and other authorities on the Syrian revolution still believe that Putin would back away from a determined western effort to enforce a no-fly zone. I am not a military authority and cannot judge. It feels as if the time for intervention has passed, and al-Qaida is too entrenched in the Syrian opposition. Europe will now have to live with refugee flows, and the rightwing backlashes they provoke, for decades.\nI can say from experience that, however, if you do not want to see Corbyn’s face in the mirror, you must resolve to never again bend the knee before fashionable opinion.\nPerhaps the best that will come from the far left’s control of the Labour party is that it will change the minds of hundreds of thousands who went along with fashionable but disgraceful ideas, as much because of the social pressure to conform as any political motive.\nI could be sneery and say they should have thought for themselves before the “left” dumped us with a British nationalist government without an opposition capable of fighting it.\nBut you should never sneer at people finding the bravery to shake off old prejudices, and learning while they do it that it does not need a great deal of courage for comfortable westerners to change their minds.\nIndeed, when compared to the courage of civilians trying to escape Russian bombs and Iranian guns in Syria, it takes no real courage at all.\n\n\n\n\n \n\nIf you do not want to see Corbyn’s face in the mirror, resolve to never again bend the knee before fashionable opinion\n\n\n"

        "text": "\nIsrael and the Lebanese group Hezbollah stepped to the brink of their most serious confrontation since they fought a brutal month-long war in Lebanon in 2006 after Hezbollah fired five anti-tank missiles at a pair of Israeli military vehicles, killing two soldiers and injuring seven others.\nThe ambush on Wednesday morning followed 24 hours of violence on Israel’s northern border that saw missiles fired both from Syria – where Hezbollah is fighting alongside the troops of President Bashar al-Assad – and Lebanon. For its part Israel launched air strikes and fired artillery across the border.\nThe two dead Israeli soldiers were identified as Captain Yochai Klengel, 25, and Sergeant Dor Nini, 20.\n\n\n\n\nTwo Israeli soldiers killed as Hezbollah missile hits vehicle on Lebanon border\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking on Wednesday evening, after a day spent in meetings with his security advisers, the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, hinted at further retaliation, saying those responsible would pay the “full price”.\nNetanayhu was meeting again with key advisers on Wedsnesday night to consider Israel’s response with one option reported to be to widen Israel’s retaliation.\nObservers in Israel were divided about whether the exchange of fire across the border had ended, with some signs that both sides were attempting to contain the fallout.\nAfter the attack, however, Israel told the UN security council it would take all necessary measures to defend itself.\n“Israel will not stand by as Hezbollah targets Israelis,” Israel’s UN ambassador, Ron Prosor, said in a letter to the security council and UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon.\n“Israel will not accept any attacks on its territory and it will exercise its right to self-defence and take all necessary measures to protect its population,” he added.\nThe US condemned the Hezbollah attack as “an act of violence” but called for calm. “We urge all parties to refrain from any action that could escalate the situation,” State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said.\nThe incident occurred at about 11.30am near Har Dov and Shebaa Farms – an area occupied by Israel where the borders of Israel, Lebanon and Syria meet. The two white-painted Israeli vehicles were travelling on a road shared with civilian traffic about 2km inside the border.\n\n\n\n\n \n\nIsrael will exercise its right to self-defence and take all necessary measures to protect its population\n\nRon Prosor\n\n\n\nAccording to Israeli military spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Peter Lerner, the first vehicle – a pickup truck – was hit from a distance of about 4km by a Kornet anti-tank missile, killing two soldiers inside.\nAs soldiers in the following vehicle exited they were hit by shrapnel in the open, injuring seven. Television footage and photographs from the scene showed the two burning Israeli vehicles and images of soldiers treating wounded colleagues.\nIsrael responded with air strikes in Syria and artillery fire into Lebanon. A Spanish UN peacekeeper serving with the Unifil monitoring force was killed in the border clashes. He was named as Francisco Javier Soria Toledo, aged 36, from Málaga.\nRoman Oyarzun Marchesi, Spain’s ambassador to the United Nations, blamed Israel for Toledo’s death. He said: “It was because of this escalation of violence, and it came from the Israeli side.”\nThe Security Council condemned the peacekeeper’s death in the strongest terms and offered its deepest sympathies.\nThe attack on the two unarmoured Israeli vehicles carrying soldiers from the Golani brigade took place a few hours after Israeli air strikes into Syria, and after two missiles landed in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.\nClaiming responsibility for the attacks Hezbollah said they were carried out by “righteous martyrs of Quneitra” in revenge for the killing 10 days ago of a Hezbollah commander in Syria in an Israeli air strike that also claimed the life of an Iranian general. In a statement, Hezbollah said its fighters destroyed a number of Israeli vehicles that were carrying Israeli officers and soldiers, and caused casualties among “enemy ranks”.\nAlthough most analysts had concluded before the attack that neither Hezbollah – embroiled in the war in Syria on Assad’s side – nor Israel, in the midst of elections, had an interest in a full-scale conflict, recent incidents have pointed to the risk of a cross-border incident turning into something more serious.\nThe incident raises fears of an escalating confrontation along the increasingly tense northern border.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Aftermath of Hezbollah missile strike on Israeli military vehicle – video\n\n\nThere have been a series of cross-border exchanges in the last 24 hours between Israeli forces and fighters in Syria and Lebanon, including members of Hezbollah.\nAn hour after the anti-tank missile attack, mortars were fired on Israeli military positions on Har Dov mountain and Mount Hermon. Israel responded by firing at least 50 artillery shells into Lebanon.\nThe UN later confirmed the peacekeeper had been killed in southern Lebanon during the border clashes.\nTensions have been mounting on Israel’s northern border for months but have escalated sharply in the last week and a half after an Israeli strike near the Syrian border town of Quneitra killed an Iranian general and a senior Hezbollah commander who were travelling in a convoy of several cars.\n\n\n\nBoth Hezbollah and Iran have threatened retaliation for that attack.\nOn Tuesday afternoon two missiles landed in the Israeli occupied area of the Golan Heights, which saw Israel return fire with artillery before the air strikes were launched under the cover of darkness.\nMoshe Ya’alon, the Israeli defence minister, warned: “The IDF [Israel Defence Forces] holds the Syrian government accountable for all attacks emanating from its land and will operate by any means necessary to defend Israeli civilians. Such blatant breaches of Israeli sovereignty will not be tolerated.”\nDespite the sharp escalation in violence in the past 24 hours, analysts pointed out that Hezbollah had chosen to carry out its attack in revenge for the killing of one of its commanders and an Iranian general in the occupied Shebaa Farms area, suggesting it may want to limit the fallout from the attack.\nIsrael Ziv, a reserve Israeli general and a former head of the IDF’s operations directorate, told reporters the situation was “flammable” and that Israel should work to contain the situation.\n“We could find ourselves in a war that does not belong to Israel,” he said.\n"

        "text": "\nWhat’s happening?\nThe Labour manifesto: so good they launched it twice. After last week’s leaked draft, real sight starts now with the official unveiling. Expect the two versions to be cross-checked more forensically than most electoral promises, for signs of altered policies, missing lines and corrected semi-colons.\n\n\n\n\nGeneral election 2017: Labour to reveal tax plans in manifesto launch – politics live\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Don’t use all your manifesto-poring quota on Labour, though: Plaid Cymru’s also appears today; and the Lib Dems are drumrolling theirs with promises on benefits for startups, a 5p charge on disposable coffee cups and the return of nursing bursaries.)\nWhile we wait for Labour’s formal announcement, nibble on these hors d’oeuvres dished out to the media in advance:\n\na fat-cat tax on big businesses, banks and Premier League clubs, with employers charged a 2.5% levy on earnings above £330,000 and 5% on those above £500,000 (in the Guardian);\na commitment to “consider the option of a more federalised country” (also the Guardian);\n30 hours a week of free nursery care for all two-year-olds until they start school, along with capital investment to create enough spaces (in the Mirror);\nnationalising the water and sewage system in England (BBC).\n\nAre there any bedazzling surprises still to jump out of the cake? Details of the tax rises for those earning over £80,000 a year, of course – though the hint is that they might move into the 45% bracket, with a new 50p top rate somewhere higher up the scale.\nOn the subject of surprises – although politicians really ought to be less surprisable by now, after Gordon Brown v Gillian Duffy, and The Thick Of It repeats – Theresa May met a real voter yesterday.\nCathy Mohan told the PM, on a walkabout in Abingdon, that she had learning disabilities and was left with £100 a month to live on, and no carer support, after government changes to disability benefits. May’s response? “We’ve got a lot of plans for people with mental health.” Which is all very well, except learning disabilities and mental health problems are two distinct things. Primer for the prime minister, please.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n \nVoter confronts Theresa May over disability benefit cuts – video.\n\n\nDespite this, May, in a Facebook Live Q&A with ITV’s Robert Peston, insisted she’d still rather take questions from the public than debate the Labour leader; the first televised leaders’ head-to-head is due to go ahead on Thursday without either of them. Jeremy from Islington did manage to get his question put to the PM by Peston. But with peak audience figures hitting 14,500 (technically a zero audience in TV terms), not many people would have witnessed the answer.\nAmid the snubs and tirades, though, a glimmer of that once-heralded kinder, gentler politics. Vote Labour, says Alistair Campbell. Tory voters are “our friends”, says Labour’s Jonathan Ashworth. Here’s Ukip stepping aside for Conservative candidates who promise to push for a “decisive Brexit”. All very chummy. But things turn bitter back on Facebook – to be fair, that’s what it’s for – where the Tories have set off a digital sprinkler of attack ads against Corbyn. The same analysis found Labour’s online campaign so far barely mentions him.\nAt a glance:\n\nJeremy Corbyn vows to help underpaid and overworked nurses.\nMore than 100,000 community events to mark anniversary of Jo Cox’s death.\nToday programme team at odds over all-male line-up on day after election.\nAnalysis of new candidates suggests Tories set to become more Eurosceptic.\nDUP leader Arlene Foster accused of sexism over “blonde” comments.\n\nPoll position\nA small contraction in the Tory lead – more like a Braxton Hicks – in yesterday’s Guardian/ICM poll, with the Conservatives down one point on 48% and Labour up one to 28%. The Lib Dems snuck up one to 10%; Ukip and the Greens as they were on 6% and 3% respectively.\nSurvation for ITV’s Good Morning Britain yanks Labour up to 30%, with the Conservatives still on 48%.\nAnd in “can we trust the pollsters?” part 274: spot the flaw in this YouGov survey “from each region of the UK”.\n\n\n\nDiary\n\nAt 10am, Leanne Wood launches Plaid Cymru’s manifesto in Rhondda.\nWe’ll also get Labour’s version at 11am, in Bradford.\nTim Farron’s Lib Dem battlebus is touring the south of England.\nAt 2pm, in South Queensferry, Nicola Sturgeon gives a speech to mark 10 years of SNP government at Holyrood.\nFrom 7pm, Theresa May takes part in a Conservative-run “telephone town hall”; you can sign up here to receive an enticingly titled “autocall”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Leanne Wood on the pier in Bangor. Photograph: Jon Super for the Guardian\n\n\nRead these\nSiobhan Fenton, in the Spectator, says the PM’s weekend visit to Northern Ireland has “backfired spectacularly”:\n\n\n\n\n \n\n Theresa May has, perhaps more than any other modern British Prime Minister, shown disinterest, if not outright contempt, for Northern Ireland. Clearly focusing on Brexit, she sees Northern Ireland as an unnecessary distraction to her main goal. So her decision to visit Northern Ireland, in order to ask for votes, naturally went down badly. The move risked showing an arrogant attitude that she would only come when she had something to get from the Northern Irish in return …\nHer visit has reignited disdain for and distrust of what many in Northern Ireland consider to be the British establishment. At a crucial time for power-sharing talks (which are still in limbo due to another deadline extension), this may extinguish goodwill from Northern Irish parties towards Britain and flare tensions further in what is already a fraught situation.\n\n\nIn the New European, Patience Wheatcroft, a Conservative peer, wonders what place there is for remainers in the party:\n\n\n\n\n \n\n The ‘C word’ seems to have been banished from the blue party’s lexicon. As the hoardings at press conferences declare, it is now ‘Theresa May’s team’. She and the members of that team exhort the electorate to vote for her, not her party, although her name will only appear on the ballot papers for Maidenhead. The manifesto, when it emerges, will be hers, drafted by her trusted henchmen, a programme for the May presidency.\nThis is somewhat disconcerting for someone who felt comfortable being labelled as a ‘Conservative’, albeit of the ‘One Nation’ variety … Worse still, I remain a remainer, a position which May cannot countenance. Yet, according to You Gov, 39% of Conservatives voted to remain in Europe on that fateful day last June and a majority of Conservative MPs were firm believers in the need for Britain to remain in the EU. They haven’t all changed their minds because, by a narrow margin, a majority of voters felt differently.\n\n\nRevelation of the day\nSpotted by BuzzFeed in Australia: a backbench Labor (that’s how they spell it; don’t bombard the readers’ editor) MP has deleted a tranche of tweets critical of Corbyn, whom he had called a “Hamas and Hezbollah supporter” who “must go”. Michael Danby told BuzzFeed “[I] certainly haven’t changed my attitude” and blamed the wipe on a “miss-interpolation” by his staff, which now knocks “mis-spoke” off the top of the excuse charts.\nThe day in a tweet\n\n\n\nAnd another thing\nWould you like to wake up to this briefing in your inbox every weekday?

        "text": "\nSPOILER ALERT: This blog is for people watching the fifth series of Homeland at UK broadcast pace. Don’t read on if you haven’t seen episode 11 – and if you’ve seen later episodes, please do not leave spoilers.\nCatch up with previous episode blogposts\n‘This will be your last assignment’\nHomeland was renewed for a sixth season last week. This means that it will complete as many seasons without Nicholas Brody as it spent with him. Its success since then has been down to its ability to incorporate real-world events into its storylines and its introduction of memorable new characters. This season, Allison Carr has been up there with the best of them. The CIA station chief is utterly plausible as arch careerist company woman and utterly chilling as manipulative murderous traitor. At turns she’s a lover, a fighter, a drinker, a schemer, but always a badass. Our Man in Damascus may be her finest hour.\n‘Our Laura Sutton problem just got worse’ \nOne of the problems with the war on terror is the inevitable assault on human rights. In the real world, we have Shaker Aamer in the news recounting the calamity of Guantánamo Bay, and in the Homeland universe we have Faisal Marwan. As the BND interrogates him, Laura publicly threatens to release the rest of the leaked CIA documents if she isn’t granted an audience. Saul gamely tries to good-cop Marwan into talking, but he can’t testify to what he doesn’t know. Betrayed, blameless and alone, Marwan takes his destiny into his own hands and commits suicide, throwing himself from his window. None of this would have been possible if Saul hadn’t moved him to a nice office with a cup of spearmint tea and warned him that he couldn’t protect him if the attack went ahead. His death seems the most avoidable tragedy of the lot and the disaster brought forth when the documents go public is one the BND will richly deserve.\n‘Strange times for Hezbollah, I admit’ \nQuinn’s already-treated bullet wound lets Carrie know that a Good Samaritan doctor helped her boy out. It’s not much, but it sets her on the trail of the terrorists. During a hugely awkward meeting with Al-Amin, the Hezbollah commander whose son she killed when she was the Drone Queen, she gets the name Hussein. When she tracks him down, Doctor Hussein is able to give up the location of Qasim’s apartment. Once inside, she finds the plans for the attack on Hauptbahnhof. Once again, Carrie swam against the tide, played a hunch and was proved right. But is it too late?\n‘Civilisation is facing an existential threat’\nBefore it pulls her from the field, the SVR requires one last service from Allison. It needs her to ensure that the sarin gas attack goes ahead and Russian spook Erna Richter puts her on to Doctor Aziz to help make that happen. Once she gets the information from him, she shoots him along with her poor, loyal bodyguard Conrad, stages the scene to implicate Aziz and passes on false information that Brandenburg airport is the target of the attack. Oh, Allison, you magnificent bastard. By the time Saul receives the text from Carrie about the attack on the U–Bahn, Allison is gone.\n‘These are zealots prophesising the arrival of the Mahdi and a countdown to the apocalypse’\nWhen you’re waging worldwide terror, technical snafus are a bugbear of your existence. The remote trigger to release the sarin gas malfunctions and when Professor Aziz cannot fix it, manual release is the only option. It’s down to the reluctant jihadi Qasim to get to the canisters already placed in the station. Bibi gives a pep talk strongly implying that, if he doesn’t come through, then his mother will pay the price. It’s enough to gain his assent, if not his support, but Bibi was never really a hearts and minds kind of guy.\nOnce inside Hauptbahnhof station at rush hour, Qasim can’t bring himself to keep his designated exit locked, but he does make it down the train tunnel towards the canisters, with Carrie in hot pursuit. The German army is tied up evacuating the airport and the 5:15 to Potsdam is on its way. The season two finale had the Langley bombing and season three finished with Brody’s gruesome execution, so be prepared for anything as we tie things up next week.\nNotes and queries\n\nIt’s interesting that Professor Aziz is no apocalypse-beckoning religious wack job. He declares himself an atheist, one radicalised by Israel’s actions in Lebanon, rendering Qasim’s babbling about “the winds of faith” obsolete. Of course, thanks to Allison, the professor now knows whether there is a God or not. She really is the gift that just keeps on giving.\nThe look Allison gives the SVR’s Anton Lenkov – at the meeting of intelligence heads right after learning that Russia intends to help the attack go ahead – could freeze the Volga River. I hope he’s got life insurance.\nWe often joke about Quinn and his indestructibility, but there is still a heart flutter whenever you hear “Damage is extensive” and see that all he can offer is mute seizure when he’s briefly brought round. It’s not his best work. Ultimately, though, Homeland knows better than to neuter one of its best assets. I have total confidence he will recover to kill again.\nIt may feel like a bit of a stretch that Al-Amin would help Carrie, but with Hezbollah fighting Isis in Syria, there is enough self-interest for him to want to scupper their plans even before Carrie shamelessly appeals to his grief over his son. For once, the sectarian complexities of the Middle East work in her favour.\nAlthough Laura is all set to release the documents, Saul has set attack dog Astrid on her, so expect the Scheisse to hit the fan there. Remember, Laura has instructed Numan to publish all 1,361 documents should anything untoward happen to her.\nSorry to harp on about dog woman from the last episode, but I wonder was she the SVR “meter maid from hell” who stuck Allison’s new instructions under her windscreen wiper?\n“Ever vigilant” – Allison’s comment to Conrad as he lets her into the bathroom alone to chat with her new SVR handler is particularly ironic. Make sure you put that on his tombstone.\nWould Russia really actively facilitate a mass casualty terrorist attack on the west? Intelligence expert Doctor Vince Houghton thinks not and I tend to agree. Still, it does make for a better finale.\n\n"

        "text": "\nIran’s Revolutionary Guards have confirmed that a senior member of their elite forces died in an Israeli attack in Syria in which six fighters of the Lebanese military group Hezbollah are also reported to have been killed.\nThe Guards issued a statement on Monday saying that Mohammad Ali Allahdadi was, as the top Iranian general, visiting the southern Syrian region of Quneitra on Sunday when an Israeli helicopter opened fire, killing the Iranian and an unspecified number of Hezbollah fighters with him.\n“A group of fighters and Islamic Resistance [Hezbollah] forces were accompanying general Mohammad Ali Allahdadi as they visited the region of Quneitra,” said the statement, which was published by the semi-official Fars news agency.\n“[They] were attacked by a military helicopter of the Zionist regime,” it added, a standard Iranian reference to Israel. “This brave general was martyred in this attack alongside some members of Hezbollah.”\nIt’s a rare example of Israel – the bitter enemy of the Islamic republic and determined opponent of its nuclear programme – killing a senior Iranian military figure.\nThe Revolutionary Guards said Allahdadi had been dispatched to Syria to operate as an adviser to help its government and people in their fight against “Takfiri-Salafi terrorists” – Iranian terminology for Sunni jihadi extremists.\nIt has also emerged that among the Hezbollah fighters killed in Sunday’s attack was Jihad Mughniyeh, the son of Hezbollah’s late commander, Imad Mughniyeh, who is believed to have been assassinated by Israel in Damascus in 2008. Another Hezbolllah commander, Mohamad Issa, also known as Abu Issa, was killed on Sunday, according to the Lebanese group.\nIran is a staunch supporter of the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad and Hezbollah, providing both with military and financial support. The Syrian conflict has cost many Iranian lives in recent years, including many members of the Revolutionary Guards. In February 2013, another senior Guards figure, General Hassan Shateri, was killed while travelling from Syria to Lebanon. Iran blamed his death on “the agents and supporters of the Zionist regime”.\nSyria gives Iran physical access to Lebanon and Hezbollah, which is strategically important for Tehran’s leaders because of the group’s geographical position in respect to Israel. Iran does not recognise Israel as a country and usually refers to it as “the Zionist regime”.\nAfter the 2006 war between the Israeli military and Hezbollah, Iran’s elite forces bolstered their presence in southern Lebanon, saying they were willing to revamp the region’s war-stricken infrastructure. This became a contentious issue for Tel Aviv but boosted the popularity of Iran among Hezbollah supporters.\nIran’s foreign ministry condemned the Israeli attack in Quneitra, which is on the Syrian controlled side of the Golan Heights. “This incident once again showed that Syria is part of the confrontation with the Zionist regime and Hezbollah is still standing firmly against Israel’s occupation and foreigners’ interference in the affairs of the regional nations,” the Iranian foreign ministry said, according to Fars.\n"

        "text": "\nFrom the period of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini’s militant opposition to the Shah’s regime in Iran in the 1970s, until his death, at the age of 82, Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani was one of Iran’s major political players. Considered a pragmatic liberal, he had at times been ruthless. His charm and immense wealth gave him a cachet that few other Iranians enjoyed. He grew close to Khomeini during the latter’s exile in the 60s and became rich as a property speculator in the following decade. He suffered imprisonment under the Shah in 1963, 1964, 1967, 1970, 1972 and 1975on and off throughout the 60s and 70s, but, after the Islamic revolution in 1979, he held various positions of state, including, from 1989 until 1997, that of president. He was credited with Iran’s reconstruction after the 1980-88 war with Iraq.\nBorn in the village of Bahraman, near Rafsanjan, into a wealthy family of pistachio farmers, Rafsanjani attended a traditional Qur’anic school and in 1948 went to a seminary in the holy city of Qom, where he lived near Khomeini. By 1956, he had completed his basic theological studies. In 1963, the Shah ordered seminarians, technically exempt, to serve in the army. Rafsanjani fled and was arrested.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Ayatollah Khamenei, left, with Rafsanjani at the tomb of Ayatollah Khomeini in Tehran in 2006. Photograph: Reuters\n\n\nHe was rumoured to have provided the gun used to assassinate the prime minister Hassan Ali Mansur in 1965. During this period Rafsanjani co-operated closely with future Islamic leaders such as the present supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. In 1978, Khomeini appointed Rafsanjani a member of the Council of the Islamic Revolution, and he was a co-founder of the Islamic Republic party in February 1979. In May that year, he escaped an assassination attempt. In 1980, he was elected speaker of the Iranian parliament and served until 1989. From then until his death he was chairman of the expediency council. In 2007, he became chairman of the crucial assembly of experts, serving until 2011.\nHe often sailed close to the wind. As speaker he had confirmed in 1985 Khomeini’s appointment of Ayatollah Hossein Ali Montazeri to succeed as supreme leader. The conservatives strongly opposed this choice but Khomeini depended on Rafsanjani for political advice. Khomeini’s biographer Baqer Moin described Rafsanjani as “a witty and soft-spoken politician” who saw himself as a “patriot and a reformer who tried to advance a pragmatic interpretation of Islam, the revolution and Khomeini’s thinking”.\nBrilliant at networking and wheeler-dealing, Rafsanjani was always a powerful figure. When he visited China and Japan in 1985 he was received as a head of state. It was during this visit that the US president Ronald Reagan thanked him for bringing a peaceful end to the hijacking of a TWA jet by Lebanon’s Hezbollah. This was one of many instances when he enraged the then prime minister, Mir Hossein Mousavi, by dominating foreign policy.\nRafsanjani was clever at appealing to liberals and, where necessary, hardliners alike. The hardliners were pitted against him and fellow liberals when the US arms-for-hostages scandal in 1986 was revealed in the Lebanese press. Montazeri and his relative Mehdi Hashemi were alarmed by this rapprochement with the US. The radicals drew them into a power base from which the conservatives might grasp the leadership when Khomeini died. Hashemi was arrested for trying to sabotage the negotiations with the US while Rafsanjani was forced to disclose the story of what became known as Irangate.\nRafsanjani survived where others might have fallen. He had Hashemi put on trial. Hashemi’s execution in 1987 sent a signal to the hardliners that Rafsanjani would not tolerate their interference. He then presented himself as a defender of the radicals. As Khomeini’s representative on the supreme defence council, he ran the war with Iraq and controlled the supply of weapons to the radical Revolutionary Guards. As president, he promoted a free-market economy, encouraging a World Bank-inspired structural adjustment policy. In 2005, he ran for a further term, but lost to Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in the run-off.\nIn 1988, he had been influential in persuading Khomeini to “swallow poison” by unconditionally accepting UN Security Council resolution 598, ending the war with Iraq. This followed Iraq’s use of chemical weapons against Iran. Rafsanjani persuaded Khomeini that using such weapons in retaliation would provoke new missile attacks against Iran, further demoralising the people and undermining the revolution. When a US warship shot down an Iranian passenger plane in July 1988, killing nearly 300 passengers, Rafsanjani helped keep tempers under control.\nNevertheless, he was ruthless when it was necessary. The newspaper Ettela’at quoted him in October 1981 as saying of the militant Mujahedin-e Khalq movement that “God’s law prescribes four punishments for them: one – kill them; two – hang them; three – cut off their hands and feet; and four – banish them. If we had killed 200 of them after the revolution, their numbers would not have mounted in this way.”\nDuring his presidency, dissidents, drug offenders, communists, Kurds and Bahais were executed. In 1982, the former prime minister Mehdi Bazargan addressed an open letter to him accusing his government of creating an “atmosphere of terror, fear, revenge and national disintegration …”\nAlthough after the Iran-Iraq war he sought closer ties with the west, he refused to lift Khomeini’s fatwa against the writer Salman Rushdie. He was a supporter of Iran’s nuclear programme, although he insisted that Iran did not seek weapons of mass destruction. After the end of his presidency he delivered a sermon at Tehran University in 1999 praising the government’s use of force to suppress student demonstrations.\nWith the passing of the years, his attitudes became softer. In a speech on 17 July 2009, he criticised restrictions on the media and the suppression of activists and stressed the importance of the popular vote. Some two million people attended this speech, which some regarded as one of the most important in modern Iranian history.\nDuring that year’s presidential elections, the radical Ahmadinejad won a landslide victory over his reformist challenger, Mousavi. Many believed that the election was rigged. Both Khamenei and Ahmadinejad, as well as the opposition Green Movement, recognised the value of securing Rafsanjani’s support. He registered as a candidate in the 2013 presidential elections, but after he was disqualified from standing backed the moderate cleric Hassan Rouhani, the current president.\nRafsanjani is survived by his wife, Effat Marashi, whom he married in 1958, and their three sons, Mohsen, Mehdi and Yasser, and two daughters, Fatemeh and Faezeh.\n• Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, politician, born 25 August 1934; died 8 January 2017\n"

        "text": "\nTroops loyal to the regime of Bashar al-Assad in Syria, backed by intense Russian airstrikes, have retaken strategic territory near the government’s stronghold of Latakia, scoring a key victory before possible peace talks in Geneva.\nThe conquest of the towns in northern Latakia, near the Turkish border, was seen by some observers as a message from Russia, which has intervened to prop up Assad, to the government in Ankara that has supported the rebel cause – especially the ethnic Syrian Turkmen in the area – and shot down a Russian fighter jet in the vicinity.\n\n\n\n\nStories from a war hospital in Jordan: 'Bombs are falling all over the Arab world'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The Russian airstrikes for more than a month had intensified to a horrific extent and they were bombing all the frontlines that we are on,” said Nasser al-Turkmani, a spokesperson for the opposition’s Turkmen-Syrian Council. “We had to withdraw from the area because it would have been suicide to stay. The destruction cannot be described, even the trees have been burned as a result of this scorched earth policy.”\nForces loyal to the Syrian government, which rebel sources say primarily comprised troops from the Lebanese Hezbollah movement, the Iraqi militia Kataeb Hezbollah, Iranian Revolutionary Guards and pro-government militia recruits, established control over the town of Rabia in northern Latakia.\nTheir victory came weeks after they seized Salma, another rebel enclave in the area. Latakia is a stronghold of the Assad regime and the Alawite sect, to which the president belongs, but the opposition had long established a foothold in the northern reaches of the area across the border from Turkey.\n\nLatakia province\n\nPeace talks are scheduled in Geneva in an attempt to negotiate an end to the five-year civil war. The opposition has complained about what it says is undue pressure from the US to attend the talks without preconditions demanding an end to shelling and sieges on civilians living in opposition-held territories. The talks were due to start on Monday but have been delayed.\n\n\n\n\nUS-led airstrikes against Islamic State in Syria and Iraq – interactive\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe opposition attributes the setbacks in Latakia to an almost complete cut-off throughout January of TOW anti-tank missiles, which had proved devastating to the regime’s armoury. They say the cut-off is a consequence of the US putting pressure on regional backers of the opposition in an effort to force them to take part in the peace talks.\n“We think the prevention of TOW supplies is part of the American-Russian understanding,” said Turkmani. “It’s clear the international community has taken a decision to destroy the armed revolution.”\nThe Russian campaign has intensified in recent weeks. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based network with wide contacts inside Syria, estimated that Russian and Syrian warplanes had conducted more than 500 air raids during the previous two weeks in northern Latakia as part of the offensive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Russian bomber during a combat flight over Latakia last week. Photograph: TASS/Getty Images\n\n\nThe monitoring group said Russian airstrikes since the intervention began last autumn had killed more than 1,000 civilians, including 300 children. Moscow’s fighter jets have primarily targeted rebels fighting to overthrow Assad, rather than the Islamic State terror group.\n\n\n\n\nLatest Syria peace negotiations delayed, says John Kerry\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite the intensity of Russia’s aerial campaign, the regime had until recently scored very limited advances, with its army battered by the prolonged conflict.\nThe Kremlin’s resolve in the latest offensive was also seen as a message to Turkey, which has continued to back the rebels across the border, especially the ethnic Turkmen who form the backbone of the opposition in northern Latakia, and late last year shot down a Russian fighter jet in the vicinity that had strayed into its airspace, leading to a collapse in relations between Ankara and Moscow.\n“There is an effort to marginalise Turkey because it is the only country left standing that has absolutely backed the Syrian revolution and insisted that to defeat Isis, Assad must be removed,” said Turkmani.\n"

        "text": "\nA day after a recording leaked of secretary of state John Kerry accusing the Kremlin of disrespecting international law, Russia’s foreign ministry warned the US not to cause “terrible tectonic shifts” with strikes on Syrian government forces.\n\n\n\n\n'Hell itself': Aleppo reels from alleged use of bunker-buster bombs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Friday, audio of Kerry saying he had “lost the argument” for the use of force against the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, was published by the New York Times. The recording was reportedly from a private meeting with non-Syrian diplomats and Syrian civilians who work for aid groups.\n“I think you’re looking at three people, four people in the [Obama] administration who have all argued for use of force, and I lost the argument,” Kerry said. “I’ve argued for the use of force.”\nNews of Kerry’s comments followed the collapse this week of an agreement brokered by the secretary of state and his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, to create a ceasefire in the five-year civil war between forces loyal to Assad, anti-government rebels and militant groups such as Islamic State. \nRussia, which has continued to bomb the city of Aleppo, on Saturday accused the US of failing to live up to its side of the bargain.\n“If the US backs out of agreements or refuses to execute them, it’s another illustration and piece of evidence that they are playing into the hands of extremists and terrorists,” ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told Russian television on Saturday, according to the state-owned media outlet Ria Novosti. \nThe Kremlin has categorized all rebels opposed to Assad as terrorist groups, and for months waged an indiscriminate bombing campaign on various cities, despite the presence of large civilian populations. A joint Syrian government-Russian campaign in Aleppo, where some 250,000 people are trapped, has over the last few days killed 338 people, including 100 children, according to the World Health Organization. \nUnited Nations secretary general Ban Ki-moon said this week that attacks on hospitals amounted to a war crimes.\nEarlier in September, warplanes from the US-led coalition against Islamic State struck Assad’s forces while attempting to attack militants, prompting an emergency meeting of the UN security council. Coalition air strikes against Assad, Zakharova warned on Saturday, could create destabilizing ripples across the Middle East. \n“If the US begins direct aggression toward Damascus and the Syrian army, it would lead to terrible tectonic shifts not only in the territory of this country, but also, in principle, in the region,” she said.\n“More than this,” Zakharova added, “here and there there have been leaks of discussions of possible scenarios” that would have “a powerful effect on Damascus, which is to say, in the large part, direct aggression”.\nIn the leaked audio, Kerry spoke with frustration about resistance within the Obama administration and US public to military action in Syria, saying: “The bottom line is that we, the Congress refused even to vote to allow that.”\nBut Kerry blamed the failure of the ceasefire deal on Russia, saying the US had no legal grounds to attack Assad. “The problem is the Russians don’t care about international law and we do,” he said.\n“And we don’t have a basis, our lawyers, unless we have a UN security council resolution, which the Russians can veto and the Chinese, or unless we are under attack from the folks there, or unless we are invited in. Russia is invited in by the legitimate regime – well, it’s illegitimate in my mind – but by the regime.”\nKerry also warned his audience that the US did not want the situation to spiral yet further out of control and even suggested the possibility of elections, including Assad, as part of a political transition the US hopes would remove the president from power.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n \nDrone footage shows scale of destruction in eastern Aleppo\n\n\n“The problem is,” he said, “you get, quote, ‘enforcers’ in there and then everybody ups the ante, right? Russia puts in more, Iran puts in more; Hezbollah is there more and Nusra is more; and Saudi Arabia and Turkey put all their surrogate money in, and you all are destroyed.”\nOn Friday, state department spokesman Mark Toner told reporters diplomacy in Syria was “on life support, but it’s not flatlined yet”. “If we do walk away from this diplomatic process,” he said, as “moribund as it is, what are the options?”\n\n\n\n\nRussia accused of war crimes in Syria at UN security council session\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs of February, before Russia intensified its bombing campaign, more than 470,000 people had been killed in the civil war in Syria, according to the Syrian Center for Policy Research. \nEarlier this week, ambassadors from the US, UK and France walked out of the UN in New York in protest when a representative for Assad moved to speak. Russia has found itself increasingly isolated even as its influence in Syria has grown.\nSweden’s foreign minister, Margot Wallstrom, criticized both governments on Saturday, writing on Twitter: “Unacceptable to bomb civilians, children and hospitals in Aleppo. No humanity. Assad & Russia moving further away from peace.”\nUS-led strikes against Isis have continued unabated. Syrian state media and Deir el-Zour 24, an activist media collective, reported on Saturday that coalition warplanes had destroyed several bridges over the Euphrates in a region held by the terror group.\n"

        "text": "\nThe search for three US contractors kidnapped in Baghdad earlier this month is focusing on Sadr City, a sprawling almost exclusively Shia neighbourhood in the north of the capital, Iraqi officials have said.\nWith the search for the trio now into its third week, Iraqi officials have revealed more details about their disappearance. According to two intelligence officers who spoke to the Guardian, the men had gone to their translator’s house in a residential complex known as the Saha apartments in the southern suburb of Dora.\nThe area is known as Abu D’sheer, and is guarded by Iraqi police and the Asa’ib ahl al-Haq militia, which has close connections with the country’s security apparatus.\n\n\n\n\nIraq launches intensive search for Americans missing in Baghdad\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“There was whisky and mezze, but it was a private gathering,” said one of the officers. “They were not making any noise, or doing anything antisocial. Sometime during the party, their landlady came to ask the translator for some late rent. He said he didn’t have any, then a while later the militias came and took them away.”\nThe men’s sudden disappearance and subsequent difficulty in tracing them fits a pattern of hostage taking in Baghdad and southern Iraq over the past nine years. The most recent was the kidnapping of 16 Turkish construction workers last September.\nThe men were seized from Sadr City and released a month later in the southern city of Basra. Their kidnappers had demanded the lifting of the siege on two Shia villages in northern Syria and a halt to oil exports by Iraq’s Kurds to Turkey, in defiance of Baghdad.\nA group of Qatari hunters who had crossed from Saudi Arabia were also detained in Iraq’s southern deserts late last year and their whereabouts remain unknown.\nIn May 2007, five British men, including the IT technician Peter Moore were seized from an Iraqi government office not far from Sadr City. Moore was release 31 months later, but his four colleagues - a personal security detail - were all killed.\nAsa’ib ahl al-Haq was responsible for the kidnapping, and Moore was freed in a coordinated series of prisoner releases that eventually saw the group’s leader, Qais al-Khazali, released from US military custody.\nKhazali has since taken a prominent role in Iraq. Backed by Iran, his group is modelled on Lebanon’s Hezbollah, a militia cum political force with sweeping influence in the country’s affairs.\n“Start by asking Qais where they are,” the intelligence officer said. “All the American agencies are looking for them.”\nUS officials in Baghdad have released no details of the kidnapping, but the secretary of state, John Kerry, said Washington did not believe the kidnapping was directly linked to Iran. It has so far refused to accuse any group of responsibility.\nOther militia groups have been named elsewhere as possible suspects, including Kata’eb Hezbollah, the Badr Brigades and the Peace Brigades - the latest incarnation of one of the main civil war protagonists, Jaysh al-Mahdi.\n“It is likely that this was opportunistic,” the Iraqi official said. “We don’t think they have been harmed.”\nThe three are understood to be contractors working for Iraq’s defence ministry. They had travelled to Dora without approval. The suburb was one of many Baghdad flashpoints during the sectarian war that consumed parts of the city between 2005 and 2007.\nA decade later, the Iraqi capital remains tense and riddled with checkpoints. Asa’ib ahl al-Haq wields significant influence in many areas and often guards entrances to neighbourhoods that are deemed insecure.\n"

        "text": "\nBinyamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, has met the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, to discuss security concerns along Israel’s northern border and how to avoid accidental clashes between Israel and Russian forces supporting Bashar al-Assad’s regime in Syria.\nNetanyahu’s lightning visit to Moscow on Monday follows concern in Israel that the ongoing Russian military buildup will threaten its defence, through fears that Russian-supplied weapons will end up in the hands of Hezbollah, fighting in Syria on Assad’s side, and because it will make it more difficult for Israeli aircraft to strike there.\nIn an unusual move, Netanyahu was accompanied by his defence chief of staff, Lt Gen Gadi Eizenkot, and the head of military intelligence, Maj Gen Herzl Halevi, whose presence – according to Israeli analysts and media – underlined the seriousness of the discussions.\n\n\n\n\nDon’t play Putin’s game in Syria. That way calamity lies | Natalie Nougayrède\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“As you know, in recent years and even more so in recent months, Iran and Syria have been arming the radical terrorist organisation Hezbollah with advanced weapons, which are aimed at us,” Netanyahu said.\n“Meanwhile, Iran, as the benefactor of the Syrian army, is trying to build a second terror front against us from the Golan. Our policy is to thwart the flow of these weapons, and to prevent the establishment of a new terror front and attacks against us from the Golan.\n“I thought it was very important to come here, both in order to make clear our positions, and also to ensure there will not be any misunderstandings between our forces,” he said.\nIn an attempt to reassure Israel, Putin told Netanyahu that his fears of Syrian and Iranian aggression in the Golan Heights, Syrian territory but occupied by Israel, were unfounded, adding the Syrian army “has no time for a second front”.\nRussia was “mindful of the many former Soviet citizens” in Israel, Putin said, adding: “Every Russian action in the area has always been very responsible. We are aware of the artillery against Israel and we condemn it. I know that these attacks are being carried out by unofficial systems.”\nOfficials indicated before the visit that Israel was seeking a similar “deconfliction” mechanism to the US and its allies – a term referring to the avoidance of accidental military clashes to allow Israeli jets to operate in Syrian airspace.\nThe meeting came amid claims that Russia is building up its military forces around an airbase in Latakia near the Syrian coast, with reports of the arrival of modern armoured vehicles, artillery and aircraft including – according to reports – four Russian Sukhoi Su-27 fighter planes.\n\n\n\n\nRussian involvement in Syria complicates UK's role, says Hammond\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIsraeli jets are believed to have struck targets near the Russian-occupied airfield on two previous occasions, in 2013 and 2014. Moscow has broadly hinted it might be prepared to send combat troops if the Assad regime requested them.\nIsrael’s desire to maintain its ability to strike targets it says are threatening it in Syria raises the prospect of an increasingly complex and dangerous combination of military forces with a stake in the Syrian civil war, increasing the risk of confrontations between rival players.\nIn recent months, Israeli jets have struck what sources have described as weapons supply facilities for Hezbollah and convoys, as well as personnel directing what it says has been a Hezbollah buildup close to Israel’s northern border.\nBut while both Russia and the US appear united in seeking to dislodge Islamic State (Isis) from its strongholds, beyond that the issues become increasingly fraught, not least with Russia’s common cause with Hezbollah and Iran in seeking to prop up Assad’s increasingly beleaguered regime.\nIn a separate development Russia said a mine fired from a mortar landed on the territory of its embassy in Damascus on Sunday. The foreign ministry said the attack, which did not inflict any casualties or damage, came from militants supported by unidentified “foreign sponsors.”\nThe kaleidoscope of groups opposing the Assad regime includes Isis and al-Qaida affiliate the Nusra Front, with Assad backed by Russia and Iran. US airstrikes have been joined by British drones with the possibility of UK military action also under consideration.\nThe US has said Russia – one of Assad’s few remaining allies – recently sent troops, artillery and aircraft to Syria, sparking fears that Moscow could be preparing to fight alongside government forces.\nThe face-to-face meeting between Netanyahu and Putin is the first since November 2013. Since the start of the Ukraine crisis, Israel has kept a low profile, attempting to maintain cordial contacts with Moscow, even as the US has criticised Putin’s policies – a balancing act analysts believe will become ever harder to pull off.\nOthers see the recent Russian buildup as signs of a determination by Moscow to re-engage in the Middle East, raising prospects of fresh instability in the region.\nWriting on the Israeli website Ynet, Efraim Halevy, a former head of Israel’s foreign intelligence agency, Mossad, underscored the urgency of the meeting from Israel’s point of view.\n“The expanding dialogue between the US and Russia requires Israel not to be portrayed as a neutral player between the battling world powers in the Middle East … When it comes to Syria, it will be important that the US takes care of Israel, just like Russia is taking care of Iran,” he said.\nMoscow argues that any military support falls in line with existing defence contracts, but Moscow and Washington on Friday launched military talks on the four-year-old conflict that has claimed nearly 250,000 lives.\nMoscow has been on a diplomatic push to get a US-led coalition of western and regional powers fighting Isis to join forces with Assad against the jihadis. The US has continued to voice sharp concerns over Putin’s role in the Syrian civil war.\n“Continued military support for the regime by Russia or any other country risks the possibility of attracting more extremists and entrenching Assad, and hinders the way for resolution,” said John Kerry, the US secretary of state.\n• This article was amended on 23 September 2015.

        "text": "\nLebanon is on the verge of electing a close ally of Iran-backed Hezbollah as president, days after the nuclear deal between the west and Tehran which leaders vowed would herald a resurgent Iranian voice in the region.\nThe endorsement of Michel Aoun, a former general and foe-turned-ally of the Syrian regime, comes after a nearly two-year standoff that has paralysed decision-making in Beirut and despite Saudi Arabia wanting his arch-rival Samir Geagea to take the post.\nGeagea has instead yielded to Aoun in a move that is now likely to anchor Iran’s influence in Lebanon.\nPerennially unstable and dependent on patrons throughout its short history, Lebanon has become a major front in the ongoing Riyadh-Tehran feud, with both sides investing billions of dollars to support their respective candidates. \n“I announce General Michel Aoun’s candidacy for the presidency of the republic,” Geagea said at a festive joint press conference. “I call on our allies to endorse Aoun’s candidacy.”\nAoun’s candidacy would need to be approved by a parliamentary majority, a result that appears within reach if Christian and Shia blocs can come together, along with MPs representing smaller sects. \nThe Saudi-backed “March 14” bloc, which accounts for most of the country’s Sunnis, and which is strongly supported by Riyadh, remained bitterly opposed to the deal until it was announced by both men on Monday night, and Geagea may face difficulties convincing them to back Aoun.\nAoun has enthusiastically supported Iran’s role in the region and his election would mark an extension of Tehran’s influence at a time when an ongoing tussle for power and influence saw Saudi Arabia sever diplomatic relations in the lead-up to the nuclear deal.\nThis flare-up in tensions was precipitated by an attack on the Saudi embassy in Tehran, which had followed the execution of a senior Saudi Shia cleric. However, it underscores a much broader standoff that has festered particularly since the start of the Syrian civil war and the war in Yemen, both of which have sectarian dimensions.\nSaudi Arabia has largely projected its power through Lebanon’s exiled former prime minister Saad Hariri. Late last year, he put forward a compromise candidate, Suleiman Franjieh, who is closely linked to the Syrian regime, in an attempt to break a deadlock which had crippled basic services and destabilised the country.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Former Lebanese prime minister Saad Hariri speaks during a ceremony to mark the tenth anniversary of the assassination of his father Rafik Hariri, in Beirut. Photograph: Hussein Malla/AP\n\n\nThe move worked, but not with the result Hariri had wanted. Aoun and Geagea have been enemies since both were generals in rival Christian camps during the Lebanese civil war between 1975 and 1990, but the one person they dislike more than each other was Franjieh.\nIf Aoun is elected leader, as is increasingly expected, it would likely damage the March 14 bloc’s status within Lebanon, and possibly be seen as another blow to Sunni standing in the region.\nSaudi officials fear Iran will use some of the windfall from the lifting of international sanctions in the wake of its nuclear deal to prop up its regional proxies, including Hezbollah, which has been directly backed by Tehran since it was founded more than three decades ago.\nSaudi concerns also extend to Baghdad and Damascus. Iranian-backed Shia militias have grown more powerful and influential than the national Iraqi army, and have until recently taken the lead in the fight against Islamic State, while Iran has forcefully intervened to rescue the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad.\nIn Yemen, Saudi Arabia launched a military campaign after accusing Iran of backing rebels who overthrew the Riyadh-backed government.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Yemeni rescuers search for victims under the rubble of a police headquarters after the building was struck overnight by Saudi-led air strikes on 18 January in the rebel-controlled Yemeni capital Sanaa. Photograph: Mohammed Huwais/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\nLebanon has long been paralysed by the divided loyalties of its political elites. The country’s parliament has failed to elect a president, by law a Christian Maronite, more than 30 times, in sessions that often faileven to achieve quorum.\nThe country’s political dysfunction descended into farce last summer, when the government failed to negotiate a deal over new landfills, leaving rubbish piling up in the streets of Beirut, and prompting demonstrations protesting official corruption.\n"

        "title": "Obama’s parting shot at Netanyahu is a futile gesture | Simon Tisdall",

        "text": "\nIn a way, Binyamin Netanyahu and Barack Obama deserve each other. Both promised great things. Both proved themselves masters of their respective political spheres. And yet both have contributed, since 2009, to a chronic deterioration in US-Israel relations and the wider Middle East meltdown. This process of polarisation and mutual alienation culminated last Friday with Obama’s active connivance in the passing of a landmark UN security council resolution. The resolution condemned all Israeli settlements in occupied Palestinian territory as a “flagrant violation” of international law that imperilled a future two-state peace.\nAmid talk of betrayal, the Israeli response, personally orchestrated by Prime Minister Netanyahu, has been swift and furious. Ambassadors from the 14 countries that backed resolution 2334 were carpeted at the foreign ministry on Christmas Day. Israel has withdrawn its ambassadors from two of the countries concerned, New Zealand and Senegal, and cut aid assistance to the latter. Planned diplomatic exchanges have been cancelled, future Israeli cooperation with UN agencies placed under urgent review, and civilian coordination with the Palestinian Authority suspended. “We will do all it takes so Israel emerges unscathed from this shameful decision,” Netanyahu said.\n\n\n\n\n \n\nIf he really believes settlements undermine peace, why abstain? Why not go the whole hog and condemn them?\n\n\nIn a sense, these are symbolic actions in response to a symbolic vote. Resolution 2334 is unenforceable. Nobody, least of all the Americans, will attempt to evict the 430,000 Jewish settlers currently living in the West Bank or the 200,000 in east Jerusalem. Nobody can force Israel to embrace John Kerry’s recycled ideas about a two-state solution, although the US secretary of state is expected to spell them out one more time before he leaves office next month. Resolution 2334 joins UN resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) in the theoretical, consistently bypassed legal canon of the Israel-Palestine issue. It says what should happen. It does not say how.\nYet for all that, the US abstention and UN vote are not lacking in significance. Netanyahu’s smug suggestion that he need only wait for the advent of a Donald Trump presidency is misleading. It is likely Trump will give him a more sympathetic hearing. He may well move the US embassy to Jerusalem – a gratuitously inflammatory gesture.\nThe personal chemistry between Trump and Netanyahu will be vastly different; insecurity, aggression and paranoia are their shared characteristics. But Trump’s vain, vague boast that he could be the one to “solve” the Israel-Palestine conflict is as insubstantial as his many other foreign policy pledges. And a Trump administration cannot simply reverse the stated will of the UN security council – backed in this case by permanent members China, Russia, France and Britain – any more than it can unilaterally scrap last year’s multinational nuclear deal with Iran.\nIt is likely the resolution will accelerate existing moves to prosecute Israel at the international criminal court. By specifically instructing UN members to “distinguish between the territory of the state of Israel and the territories occupied since 1967”, it may also encourage new boycotts and sanctions. But more than that, the UN vote has highlighted the extraordinary extent of Israel’s international isolation under Netanyahu. Even he cannot persuasively dismiss the unanimous opinion of countries as diverse as Japan, Ukraine, Malaysia, Venezuela, Angola and Spain. It takes a lot to make an enemy of New Zealand, but Netanyahu has managed it.\nThis was the world telling Netanyahu, with one voice, that the expanded settlement policy he has encouraged and justified is wrong – wrong legally, wrong morally, wrong politically, and wrong in terms of Israel’s future peace and security. The odd thing is, he knows this. In 2009, Netanyahu, newly re-elected, described his “vision” of a historic peace, “of two free peoples living side by side in this small land, with good neighbourly relations and mutual respect, each with its flag, anthem and government, with neither one threatening its neighbour’s security and existence”. Although he appeared to renege during last year’s election campaign, Netanyahu still claims to support a two-state solution. Now the international community’s message is unequivocal: you were right in 2009. So stop undermining the prospect of peace. Honour your promise.\n\n\n\n\nUS abstention allows UN to demand end to Israeli settlements\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObama has not been much help. He, too, made a big speech in 2009, shortly after taking office, pledging a “new beginning” for the Middle East. But Obama’s so-say inspirational Cairo performance turned out to be the prelude not to transformational progress, but to regional disintegration and growing American detachment. The US withdrawal from Iraq left a political vacuum in Baghdad that Iran and its Shia allies filled. Then, in partial reaction, came the Sunni jihadists of Islamic State. The Arab spring revolts of 2011 left Washington nonplussed. In Egypt it fretted over the toppling of Hosni Mubarak and welcomed his eventual replacement by another pro-American military dictator. In Syria, Obama prematurely anticipated the demise of Bashar al-Assad, only to back away when the going got tough, letting in the Russians and the Iranians (again) and squandering US leverage.\nObama never seemed to grasp the implausibility of publicly pressurising the risk-averse Netanyahu into peace talks with the Palestinians, even as Israel’s immediate neighbours fell prey to civil disorder and Islamist insurrection. As the US retreated, physically and diplomatically, Hezbollah (Iran’s and Hamas’s Lebanese ally), advanced. Little wonder, in this chaotic context, that the Obama-Kerry “comprehensive plan” for peace ran into the sand in 2014. Little wonder, perhaps, that Israelis now eye the Golan Heights, their disputed land border with Syria, with growing apprehension as Assad’s forces are advancing.\nAdd in Libya and Yemen, for example, and Obama’s Middle East legacy is not one to be proud of. Like Netanyahu, 2009 promise went unfulfilled. And it is fitting that his final days in office should be marked by petulance and impotence. Obama did not push nearly hard enough for peace when the regional climate might have allowed it. In 2011, he vetoed a similar UN resolution, arguing US-brokered talks would find a way forward. Obama, senior partner in a dysfunctional relationship, allowed Netanyahu to beard him repeatedly, not least in the latter’s self-justificatory 2015 address to Congress. Cautious to the end, even Obama’s UN demarche on Friday was half-hearted. If he really believes settlements are undermining peace, why abstain? Why not go the whole hog and vote to condemn them? And why wait seven years?\nWhat happens next, in the dawning Trump era, is deeply worrying. A continuing, polarising stalemate over Palestinian statehood looks probable. So, too, do expanding settlements on occupied land and possibly annexations, as mooted by Netanyahu’s rightwing allies. How long before the Palestinian response grows violent once again? And how long before Netanyahu induces an impulsive, know-nothing Trump to take joint action against the bigger target, Iran?\n"

        "text": "\nTurki al-Faisal is a remarkably modest man for a senior Saudi prince, always insisting that he speaks for no-one but himself and certainly not the ruling family. But the kingdom’s former intelligence chief and ambassador to Washington has a habit of making waves when he appears in public.\nLast weekend, he was one of several VIPs who attended a conference of the Iranian opposition movement, the National Council of Resistance Iran (NCRI), near Paris. Turki accused the Islamic Republic of destabilising the Middle East and “spreading chaos”. He even said that he hoped to see the fall of the regime - in the familiar phrase of the Arab spring uprisings.\nOn a positive note, Turki did point to the long friendship and cooperation between Arabs and Persians, praising cultural achievements and religious commonalities and arguing that current tensions were an exception. But he also attacked what he called the “Khomeini cancer” - strong words for such an exquisitely polite man to use about the architect of the 1979 revolution, who is still officially revered in Iran.\nRelations between Riyadh and Tehran have seen ups and downs since that watershed year. Nowadays they are opposing sides of the many conflicts of the region - from Syria and Lebanon to Iraq, Bahrain and Yemen. They also diverge on the ever sensitive issue of Palestine and Israel. The Saudis have plenty of money and a long-standing though changing alliance with the US, but nothing to match Iran’s ally, Hezbollah, which plays a key role fighting in support of Bashar al-Assad.\nStrategic and economic rivalry between these neighbours - feeding through into sharp differences over oil exports - is intertwined with an ugly sectarian discourse that plumbs the depths of Sunni-Shia hostility and intolerance.\nRelations hit a new low in January when the Saudis executed Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr, a renowned Shia cleric in the kingdom’s eastern province. Iranian mobs stormed the Saudi embassy in Tehran and consulate in Mashhad, triggering a rupture in diplomatic relations and a propaganda war that has continued ever since.\nIran often accuses the Saudis of supporting Isis - or Daesh as it is universally known. And it was predictably quick to lash out at Turki’s comments: “The Saudis are resorting to well-known terrorists ... as they have also done in Iraq, Yemen and Syria,” said a foreign ministry official. “They use terrorism....to further their aims against Islamic countries.” The Revolutionary Guard echoed the complaints.\nTehran’s position is that the NCRI, also known as the People’s Mujahideen, is a terrorist organisation. The EU, US and other western countries no longer take that view. Until 2003 the group was based in Iraq, and was supported and used by Saddam Hussein as means of pressuring Iran. It played a key role in exposing Iran’s undeclared nuclear activities. It enjoys no visible support inside Iran and is often described as “cult-like”. \nTurki attracted attention on another controversial subject recently when he shared a platform with a retired Israeli general and argued for a two-state solution and Palestinian independence - while sharing concerns about Iran’s nuclear capabilities in the wake of last year’s international agreement. Iran condemns Israel as an “illegitimate” regime and supports the Islamists of Hamas and Islamic Jihad, which advocate resistance to occupation and are at odds with the PLO.\nWhatever Turki’s official standing he still runs the prestigious King Faisal Centre for Research and Islamic Studies in Riyadh. Last Sunday’s speech was closely covered by Saudi-owned media - ensuring that his words reached a large audience. And one of the several western PR companies working for the Saudis took the trouble to distribute reports of the event to journalists in case they had missed it or its significance.\nMessages like Turki’s are the headlines of geopolitical competition at a tense time. But there are consequences for ordinary people. In May Iran announced that it would not allow its nationals to travel to Saudi Arabia for the Hajj this September after the breakdown of talks overshadowed by the deaths of 464 Iranians in a stampede in Mecca last year. That was surely evidence, if it were needed, that even as they abuse each other, both governments are failing to serve their own citizens.\n"

        "text": "\nThe Syrian ceasefire is facing its first serious test after Syrian opposition leaders claimed it was close to collapse and the French government called for a meeting of the monitoring body amid allegations that Syrian and Russian forces had seriously breached its terms.\nThe ceasefire came into force on Friday night and was widely thought to have held on the first day, but the Syrian High Negotiating Council (HNC), which represents rebel factions, said on Sunday that breaches had nullified the process.\nThe International Syria Support Group (ISSG) will meet in Geneva at the request of the French to examine whether the alleged breaches were deliberate, the product of competing misinterpretations of the ceasefire, or military error.\nThe French foreign minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault, said: “We have received indications that attacks, including by air, have been continuing against zones controlled by the moderate opposition.\n\n\n\n\nSyrian rebel factions say they will respect two-week truce\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“All this needs to be verified. France has therefore demanded that the taskforce charged with overseeing the cessation of hostilities meet without delay.”\nA spokesman for the Saudi-backed HNC said the cessation of hostilities was broken by Syria’s government 15 times within the first day, and that there were further violations by Russia and Hezbollah, both allies of president Bashar al-Assad.\nIn the gloomiest assessment, Asaad al-Zoubi, head of the HNC’s delegation to the peace talks, gave a gloomy assessment of the truce. “We are not facing a violation of the truce … we are facing a complete nullification,” he said on Al Arabiya al Hadath TV. \n“I believe the international community has totally failed in all its experiments, and must take real, practical measures towards the [Syrian] regime,” Zoubi said, without elaborating.\nRussia, which has swung the war in favour of Assad with a five-month bombing campaign, accused “moderate” rebels and jihadis of nine ceasefire violations. But Lt Gen Sergei Kuralenko, head of Moscow’s coordination centre in Syria, was quoted by Russian news agencies as saying that on the whole, the ceasefire was holding.\nThe White House said it had always expected potholes in the initial ceasefire.\nThat view was shared in London by the defence secretary, Michael Fallon, who said the ceasefire “appears largely to be holding for now” but warned a major change of behaviour by the Russians was required for it to persist. He again claimed 70% of Russian attacks were directed at moderate Syrian opposition.\nStephen O’Brien, the under secretary general for UN emergency relief, also claimed the ceasefire was holding and 20 trucks had been despatched with aid to Moadamiyet al-Sham, a town in southern Syria encircled by government forces, and another 31 were to follow on Monday. He said the aim was to reach 4 further besieged towns in the coming days.\nHe appealed to all sides: “Safe unimpeded access by humanitarians to bring aid is the law. It should be granted come what may. States have already signed up to this – it is not conditional.”\n\n\n\n\nThe Guardian view on the US and Russia in Syria: rivals who need each other | Editorial\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe extension of aid will depend on whether the ISSG, led by the United States and Russia, can quickly iron out breaches of the ceasefire, and prevent the trust evaporating, leading to a rapid collapse. The ISSG is supposed to monitor compliance with the deal and act rapidly to investigate any breaches.. The Americans and the Russians have separate ceasefire monitoring operations and arguably different interpretations of the territories that are subject to the ceasefire.\nAll sides have agreed that fighting against Islamic State and the al-Nusra Front – deemed to be a Syrian franchise of al-Qaida – are excluded from the ceasefire. Some Syrian rebels supported by the west fight alongside al-Nusra.\nSaudi Arabia has also signalled that it is planning to join the fight against Isis, with an aide to the defence minister confirming that four fighter jets had arrived at Turkey’s southern Incirlik air base. They had not yet participated in any attacks, he said.\nAn HNC spokesman, Salim al-Muslat, said it was still unclear how the cessation of hostilities was supposed to function.\nAsaad al-Zoubi, another HNC official, said the agreement had collapsed before it started and it faced “complete nullification”, al-Arabiya al-Hadath TV reported.\n“We need to get an explanation from the Russians on the strikes that took place on Sunday,” said one western diplomat.\nIn a bid to calm the atmosphere, the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, said on Monday that the cessation was largely holding but that major and regional powers were looking into some incidents that he hoped would be contained.\nThere was particular concern about violence in Eastern Ghouta, a stronghold of the Jaish al-Islam (Islam Army) rebel group, which is an influential member of the main opposition alliance, the High Negotiations Committee, and has been used as a launch pad for rocket and mortar attacks on Damascus.\nThe UN’s Syria envoy, Staffan de Mistura, is hoping to reconvene peace talks in Geneva next Monday, but the progress of the ceasefire will determine whether even proximity talks, in which both sides negotiate through an intermediary, get under way.\nIn a sign of how the talks might develop, it was suggested that Syria could become a federal state if that model worked in the country. The suggestion was made by the Russian deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, at a news briefing as a way of resolving arguments about whether Assad would remain in power. Ryabkov also warned there were signs that Turkey, on the northern border of Syria, was still preparing attacks.\nAn official with the Syrian Arab Red Crescent said dozens of lorries carrying aid had entered a besieged rebel-held suburb of the Syrian capital, Damascus, for the first time since the truce took effect. The UN wants to deliver food, medicine and other supplies to more than 150,000 people under siege in Syria over the next five days.\nThe office of the UN human rights chief, Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein, said thousands of people risked starving to death in besieged towns and villages inaccessible to humanitarian aid groups.\nPending approval from parties to the conflict, the UN said it was ready to deliver aid to an estimated 1.7 million people in hard-to-reach areas over the first three months of this year through UN inter-agency convoys.\n\nAid deliveries planned for besieged areas in Syria\n\n"

        "text": "\nIran is escalating its role in the war in Syria, sending hundreds of men from its elite forces to support Bashar al-Assad and dispatching its most celebrated Revolutionary Guards commander to an area where an anti-rebel offensive is expected shortly.\nArab diplomats and analysts said on Wednesday that Iran had already sent hundreds of troops to northern and central Syria, after reports that up to 2,000 are to be deployed alongside fighters from Tehran’s Lebanese ally Hezbollah and foreign Shia militia units under the cover of Russian airstrikes.\nIran has backed the Assad regime from the start of the war four and half years ago, but its role so far has been relatively low-profile. Pictures of Gen Qassem Suleimani, commander of the al-Quds force of the Revolutionary Guards, addressing fighters in Syria, reinforce the perception that a new stage of deeper Iranian involvement may be beginning.\n\n\n\nDudi Cohen \n(@dudi_cohen)\nSo many cell phones around #Suleimani in #Syria speaking to mixed volunteers and #Hezbollah forces pic.twitter.com/2w2lXBo6M8\n\nOctober 13, 2015\n\n\nDiplomats say Iran urged Russia to intervene militarily in support of Assad after serious losses of territory and manpower this year. Suleimani visited Moscow in July, reportedly to make that point. But some experts also see a degree of competition between Moscow and Tehran for influence in Damascus.\nSuleimani was pictured addressing unidentified fighters in the Latakia area. The image was distributed on Tuesday by al-Mayadeen, a Lebanese TV channel that is close to Iran and Hezbollah. This generated intense attention on social media. The channel linked his presence to a forthcoming offensive against anti-Assad rebels.\n\n\n\nAli Hashem علي هاشم \n(@alihashem_tv)\n#IRGC Quds force commander Gen. Qassem Suleimani arrived in #Syria for the expected military campaign pic.twitter.com/9ImJOEZnh6\n\nOctober 13, 2015\n\n\nIran has advised the Syrian army and trained Shia militia units from Iraq, Pakistan and Afghanistan. The Kuwaiti newspaper al-Rai reported that Tehran would send 2,000 troops to Syria, along with 5,000 Iraqi and Afghan Shia fighters.\n Iranian fighters began arriving two weeks ago, after Russian airstrikes began, and have accelerated in recent days, an unnamed regional official told the Associated Press. The Iranians flew into Damascus airport and were transported to a base in Latakia from where they were deploying in Hama and Aleppo provinces.\n“We have seen received confirmed reports of Revolutionary Guards being deployed in the hundreds in an attempt to regain territory recently lost in Aleppo by Assad,” a senior Arab diplomat told the Guardian. Another Arab source warned, however, that information about the Iranians could be deliberately misleading propaganda.\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported on Wednesday that Iranian troops were continuing to arrive and being sent to a base in Jableh, near Latakia. \n“There is no doubt an Iranian escalation [is being] coordinated with the Russian intervention,” said Emile Hokayem of the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS). “There is an operational and territorial division of labour, whereby Iran contributes skilled manpower and Russia air power, probably increasingly in the form of close air support.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n \nIran’s huge underground missile depot shown on state TV\n\n\nIran’s enhanced role is a risky one, as shown by the rising number of funerals held for members of the Revolutionary Guards killed in Syria in recent months. The Syrian conflict has cost the lives of more senior Iranian guards than any other conflict apart from the eight-year war with Iraq in the 1980s. \nMembers of the guards killed in Syria are referred to as “defenders of the holy shrine” by Iranian media. “In Qom, people are seeing such funerals almost on daily basis,” one source said. “This shows that they are sending soldiers to fight in Syria.”\nLast week a senior guards commander, Hossein Hamedani, was killed near Aleppo. It emerged on Wednesday that two other senior members were killed this week: they were named as Farshad Hasonizadeh and Hamid Mokhtarband. The Isna news agency said they were helping the Syrian army and “Islamic resistance fighters”.\n\n\n\n\nSenior Iranian commander killed in Syria\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHasonizadeh was a former commander of the guards special forces unit, Tip-e-Saberin. Morad Veisi, an expert on Iran’s armed forces who works with Radio Farda in Prague, said more Saberin personnel appear to have been sent to Syria.\n“It is no coincidence that three Iranian generals have been killed in just a week,” said Hokayem of the IISS. “The planning and operations of ambitious campaigns require senior oversight so more risk-taking by Iranian generals.”\nOn Monday two funerals were held in south Tehran for guards from Iran’s Fatemiyoun brigade, composed of Iran-based Afghan expatriates.\nFollowing the rising Iranian death toll in Syria, Iranian officials have become vocal in vowing to crush “takfiri terrorists”. Mohsen Rezaee, a former guards commander, said: “We will bury takfiris in Syria and Iraq and we will prove to the world that conspiracy and deception has no place in Islam.” A takfiri is a Sunni Muslim who believes it is legitimate to kill Muslim apostates, and is Iran’s terminology when referring to Islamic State (Isis).\nAli Akbar Velayati, a foreign policy adviser to Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said this week that maintaining Assad in power remained Tehran’s red line. “Russia’s presence in Syria is important and effective,” he said. “We’ve supported Bashar al-Assad for more than four years and we will continue to do so.”\n"

        "text": "\nTehran’s diplomatic quarter, in the north of the capital, lies in the shadow of the Alborz mountains, their snow-capped peaks overlooking tree-lined avenues and elegant pre-revolutionary palaces. Police posts guard foreign missions, though the building that used to be Saudi Arabia’s embassy is now damaged and empty.\nOutside it stands a shiny new blue sign marking Nimr al-Nimr Street, in honour of the Saudi Shia cleric whose execution in January triggered a furious assault on the embassy and a profound crisis in the already troubled relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia.\n Tehran has a long tradition of politically-inspired street names. Winston Churchill Avenue, near the British embassy, was renamed for the IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands. Off Valiasr Street is Imad Moghniyeh Square, commemorating the Hezbollah commander killed by the Mossad or CIA. Nearby is Khaled Islambouli street, remembering the Egyptian Islamist executed for assassinating Anwar Sadat in 1981.\n The assault on the Saudi embassy (and consulate in Mashhad), was apparently orchestrated by the Basij, the volunteer force of the Iranian revolutionary guards. And it followed warnings from Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the Supreme Leader himself, of “divine vengeance” if Nimr was killed.\n But when the Saudis hit back by severing their ties with Iran, the attack looked like an own goal because it diverted attention away from the execution – one of 47 on the same day. Riyadh insisted the cleric was a violent extremist, while Nimr’s followers in the kingdom’s eastern province portrayed him as a “martyr” and peaceful activist representing a persecuted minority.\n Saudis were outraged by what they saw as Tehran’s interference in their internal affairs, especially since Nimr was a Shia ayatollah. They were unimpressed by the detention of the embassy rioters and the dismissal of a deputy governor - or by condemnation from President Hassan Rouhani and Mohammad Javad Zarif, his foreign minister. Both had been under attack by hardliners for not doing enough to confront the Saudis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Nimr al-Nimr Street, Tehran.

Even Khamenei conceded later that it had damaged Iran and Islam.\n It also felt like the last straw in a relationship had been rocky since the 1979 revolution and Saudi backing for Saddam Hussein in the first Gulf war. In recent years Iraq, Bahrain, Lebanon and Yemen have all been sources of contention and anxiety, along with Barack Obama’s tilt towards Iran and his efforts to tackle its nuclear programme. Overall, Tehran’s growing confidence is at Riyadh’s expense.\n “The Saudis feel Iran is gaining and they are losing,” one senior Iranian adviser observed before the Nimr affair. “Iran is ascending and the Arab world is in limbo. Saudi Arabia is playing an angry, reactive violent game.”\n The Saudis lambast Iran for their support for Bashar al-Assad and their Lebanese Shia ally Hezbollah. The Iranians blame Riyadh for backing jihadi groups and the Wahhabi ideology that in part inspires Isis. National rivalry is overlaid with viciously sectarian language that exploits both Sunni-Shia animosity and Arab-Persian hostility. Each accuses the other of fomenting terrorism.\n Iranians tend to see themselves as the descendants of an ancient civilisation and Saudis as upstarts - “unelected emirs and kings” enthroned by western imperialists. Iranians have regional reach – most impressively in the form of the Revolutionary Guards; the Saudis have little more than cash. Riyadh’s dependence on the US is a source of scorn. “It is not enough to have a chequebook,” quips Foad Izadi of Tehran University. “People who are associated with the Americans do not want to fight.”\n Iran ramped up its anti-Saudi rhetoric at the start of the Yemen war last year and turned up the volume after the 2015 hajj tragedy in Mecca – in which 460 Iranians were amongst at least 2200 pilgrims killed.\n\n\n\nKD-Group \n(@kdhost_ir)\nکاریکاتور/ چهره واقعی عربستان! https://t.co/EOsiDf15hg pic.twitter.com/8QTNLrY2Yh\n\nJanuary 8, 2016\n\n\n Iranians relish needling the Saudis: on social media King Salman is compared to Abu-Bakr al-Baghdadi, the Isis “caliph.” A spoof Iranian video shows a Saudi leading an army of sheep into battle while bragging about heroism and victory. Saudis reciprocate: clerics vilify Shias as “Rafida,” or Zoroastrians. When watermelons imported from Iran were found to contain chemical pesticides they were nicknamed “Safavid watermelons” -a reference to the dynasty that built a powerful Persian nation-state and confronted the Ottomans from the 16th century.\nIn a new book studying this tangled relationship, the Iranian scholar Banafsheh Keynoush notes the growing prominence of intelligence personnel on both sides, which makes it even harder for them to deal sensibly with each other - despite good intentions at the top. “Iranians at senior levels have anxiously made it clear to me that their intent is never to undermine Saudi Arabia irreparably, mindful that doing so could further fuel extremism,” she writes.\n Last week the Saudis announced the arrests of 32 people in the Eastern province who were said to have been spying for Iran. “They are still throwing mud at each other,” observed the diplomat. “But they will have to find ways to climb down.” Iran, noted Izadi, “already has too many enemies. The Saudis have a lot of money so picking a fight with them is not really in Iran’s national security interest.” \n The likeliest candidate for backchannel diplomacy is Oman, the only Gulf state with close links to Iran – and which helped achieve a breakthrough in the nuclear talks. Qatar may also be able to mediate. \nAnd last week’s Iranian elections have strengthened Rouhani and Zarif – who has spoken privately of the need to mend fences with Arab neighbours. Mohammed Bin Salman, the powerful Saudi deputy crown prince and defence minister, is capable of springing surprises. Agreement on oil production quotas at a time of plummeting prices is another urgent matter for both countries.\n Russia and China are also anxious to narrow the gap so that Tehran and Riyadh can be kept at the same table for efforts to translate a fragile Syrian ceasefire into some kind of political settlement. Yet given the fraught history of Iranian-Saudi ties it’s still a fair bet that the new sign on Nimr al-Nimr street won’t be coming down any time soon.\n"

        "text": "\nWhile US and European politicians wring their hands and indulge in recriminations over the fall of Aleppo, Russia, Iran and Bashar al-Assad’s Syrian regime are celebrating a “historic” victory they believe has turned the tide in the six-year-old war.\n“Is there nothing you will not lie about? Do you have no shame?” demanded Samantha Power, US ambassador to the UN, accusing the three allies of barbarism and continuing atrocities as rebel territory fell to pro-Assad forces. \nAnybody who expected the Russians to show contrition over Aleppo has not studied the denouement of the second Chechen war in 2000. Vladimir Putin, Russia’s then newly installed president, ordered the extermination of separatist resistance. When the siege of Grozny ended, the UN described Chechnya’s capital as “the most destroyed city on earth”. \nUntil now. Putin employed similar ruthlessness to destroy Aleppo from the air, determined to end the war by military means. Russian diplomats have mostly used on-off US- and UN-brokered peace talks to play for time, running out the clock on the Obama administration while pro-Assad forces advanced.\nNow the question arises: what next for Syria? While the conflict may have tilted decisively against the so-called moderate rebel forces backed by the west, Saudi Arabia and its Gulf partners, it is not over. Assad’s regime remains weak, and critically beholden to foreign powers. And there are signs his victorious allies are already falling out, like thieves squabbling over the spoils.\nRussia, whose forceful intervention in 2015 blindsided the US, may now seek to wind down its costly military involvement, while playing up its role as the premier Middle East power-broker. To this end, Putin announced on Friday that he would convene peace talks for later this month, attended by Iran and Turkey but none of the Gulf states or western powers.\nHe will keep his air and naval bases in Syria. He will keep Assad under his thumb. But he will to try to disprove Barack Obama’s prediction that Russia will be sucked into an open-ended quagmire similar to Afghanistan in the 1980s.\nRussia’s current alliance of convenience with Iran could quickly become problematic. Iranian-backed Shia militias from Lebanon, Iraq and Afghanistan did most of the ground fighting in Aleppo. Tehran is in triumphal mood. It interprets Aleppo as a symbolic victory over its old enemy the US and the Sunni leadership of its arch-rival Saudi Arabia. \nThere is revived talk of an Iranian “Shia crescent” stretching from Afghanistan through Iraq and Yemen to the Mediterranean. Unlike Moscow, Tehran views its successes through a sectarian prism. “We see it as our duty to support those trying to force takfiri [Sunni jihadi] terrorism out of their territory,” the president, Hassan Rouhani, told Assad in a celebratory phone call. \nThe very real prospect of ongoing sectarian struggle in Syria is not attractive for Moscow. It carries uncomfortable echoes of the Sunni insurgency against US and UK forces in post-invasion Iraq. Now that the moderate rebel forces are sidelined and dispersed, Iran’s maximalist approach could strengthen support among Syria’s Sunni majority for al-Qaida-linked jihadis whose forces are now concentrating in Idlib, south-west of Aleppo. It could even boost Islamic State, which still controls a large swath of territory around Raqqa in the north. \nFor Putin, the bigger picture includes indications that the incoming Trump administration may seek an accommodation with Moscow. Unlike Obama, Donald Trump has indicated he could accept Assad remaining in power if it advances the fight against Isis. But he and his hawkish new security team are fiercely hostile to Iran.\nIn return for normalising relations, accepting Russia’s position in Syria and, for example, burying the hatchet over Ukraine, Trump could demand Moscow back away from Iran, end arms sales and nuclear industry cooperation, and help curb Isis and Tehran’s sectarian ambitions in Syria and Iraq. \nA grand bargain of this kind would suit Israel, where alarm is growing at the likelihood that Iranian-directed militias, notably Hezbollah, will soon deploy along its border with Syria, particularly the disputed Golan Heights. In a warning to Rouhani this week, Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, accused Iran of plotting to destroy his country. “Don’t threaten us. We are not a rabbit, we are a tiger. If you threaten us, you endanger yourself,” Netanyahu warned.\nIsrael counts Moscow as a kind of ally these days, a reflection of Netanyahu’s bad relationship with Obama. It would probably accept a Russian-imposed settlement in Syria if it brought stability and squeezed out Iran. Doubtless this possibility will be discussed during Netanyahu’s upcoming meeting with Trump and Rex Tillerson, Trump’s pro-Moscow nominee as secretary of state. \nSyria’s future integrity and stability will also be determined to a large degree by Turkey, which has established a military presence in the north of the country – the only Nato member to do so. \nRecep Tayyip Erdoğan, Turkey’s president, is one of the war’s losers. He pressed hard for Assad’s departure. He covertly backed Sunni jihadis. He sought to contain Syria’s anti-regime Kurds, but was thwarted by Washington. And he simultaneously exploited the crisis to suppress Turkey’s indigenous Kurds. His harsh tactics produced a spate of retaliatory Isis and Kurdish terrorist attacks on Turkish cities.\nNow, with his foe Assad untoppled and his own leadership shaken by last summer’s failed army coup, Erdogan’s priority is security, internal and external. To this end, he has patched up relations with Putin after Turkey shot down a Russian warplane last year. Excluding the western powers, Turkey and Russia arranged this week’s Aleppo evacuation deal. \nErdoğan is also cooperating with Iran, majority Sunni Turkey’s historical Persian-Ottoman imperial competitor. Their shared interests include curbing Isis and quashing Kurdish autonomy. Like Turkey, Iran has a large ethnic Kurdish minority. \nBut as a recent analysis by the independent International Crisis Group pointed out, this collaboration may fall victim to old rivalries and suspicions as both countries seek to shape a future Syrian settlement, competing for control, territory and resources. \n“The dynamics instead point toward deepening sectarian tensions, greater bloodshed, growing instability across the region and greater risks of direct – even if inadvertent – military confrontation between [Turkey and Iran] where their spheres of influence collide,” the ICG said, pointing to the recent killing of Turkish soldiers in northern Syria, allegedly by an Iranian drone. \nFor the US and the EU, the fall of Aleppo, Assad’s survival and Russia’s and Iran’s ascendancy represent a generational foreign policy setback. Samantha Power’s attack reflected Washington’s impotent rage. American influence in the Middle East is now at a very low ebb, at the very moment when the region is at its most chaotic. \nBy general agreement, Europe’s management of the crisis on its doorstep has been nothing short of disastrous. The consequences, in terms of terrorism, migration, instability and the damage done to the EU’s credibility as an international actor will be long-lasting. Over what happens next in Syria, Europe will have little or no say.\n"

Saudi Arabia and Turkey set up a military coordination body a few weeks ago.\nSaudi Arabia was one of the first Arab countries to join the anti-Isis coalition in September 2014 and mounted several air strikes on targets in Syria. But these diminished rapidly last March when it launched its intervention in neighbouring Yemen. The use of ground troops has been hinted at in the past, but the latest announcement is formal and serious, the sources said.\nDespite an increasingly strained relationship with the US – especially over the nuclear deal with Iran, the Saudis’ strategic rival – the kingdom is keen to do more to demonstrate its readiness to fight terrorism. Saudi Arabia has been repeatedly targeted by Isis in recent months, and is often accused of being an incubator for violent extremism.\nAsiri suggested that recent progress against Houthi rebels in the war in Yemen was allowing Saudi Arabia to free up forces for deployment in Syria. A decision could be taken at a Nato summit in Brussels next week.\n“There is frustration with the current efforts put in place to fight Daesh,” said the Saudi analyst Mohammed Alyahya. \n“Increasingly, it seems that none of the forces on the ground in Syria (besides rebel groups) is willing to fight Isis. The Assad regime, Iran, Russia, and Hezbollah are preoccupied with fighting Bashar al-Assad’s opposition with one ostensible goal: to keep Bashar al-Assad in power, irrespective of the cost in innocent Syrian lives.”\n"

Hopes for the deal had been low over the weekend, with opposition groups insisting that none of its proponents could force each other to comply on contested issues, such as which areas remain valid bombing targets, or who should receive aid.\n\n\n\n\nSyrian ceasefire deal - the Guardian briefing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking in Washington, John Kerry said early reports spoke of some reduction of violence as well as sporadic fighting, but that it was “far too early to draw definitive conclusions”.\n“There will be undoubtedly be reports of violations here and there and that’s the nature of ceasefires,” the US secretary of state said. “For all the doubts that exist, and there will be many challenges in the days to come, despite that, this plan has a chance to work.”\nIn his remarks, Kerry suggested the Assad regime would be able to conduct airstrikes against the al-Nusra front (which recently changed its official name to Jabhat Fateh al-Sham) if it had Russian and US approval.\nHowever, that was later denied by the state department spokesman, John Kirby, who said: “The arrangement announced last week makes no provision whatsoever for the US and Russia to approve strikes by the Syrian regime, and this is not something we could ever envision doing. A primary purpose of this agreement, from our perspective, is to prevent the Syrian regime air force from flying or striking in any areas in which the opposition or Nusra are present.”\nHe added: “The purpose of the JIC, if and when it is established, would be to coordinate military action between the US and Russia, not for any other party.”\nKerry applauded opposition groups for showing the “courage” to separate themselves from al-Nusra, which has declared itself officially separated from al-Qaida, but which is considered by the US still to be an al-Qaida affiliate. And Kerry warned other groups to disengage from al-Nusra units on the front.\n“We can’t somehow adopt the moral hazard of just because they fight fiercely say, oh, we’re going to somehow allow al-Qaida to be the tip of our spear with respect to Assad,” Kerry said, adding that such a strategy would be “crazy and ultimately self-destructive”, raising the level of terror in Europe, the Middle East and elsewhere.\n“It is not advisable for the opposition, who have support from countries that are threatened by Nusra to be playing with Nusra. That is a losing proposition,” the secretary of state said. “We have made it clear … If they choose to join with al-Nusra in attacks, then they have made the choice of being with Nusra and they run the risks.”\n\n\n\n\nSyria: bitter foes weigh up chance of peace, but prepare for war to rage on\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRussia insisted it would keep its jets away from opposition areas, which did not co-exist with jihadist groups, such as Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, which is proscribed by the US as a terrorist group. It had also lobbied unsuccessfully for the Islamist groups Ahrar al-Sham, and Jaish al-Islam to be added to the list.\nThe question of which opposition areas are still considered valid targets is central to the wariness of opposition groups, particularly in Aleppo and Idlib province where global jihadists and Islamists have become prevalent over the course of the five-year war.\n“We want to know what the guarantees are,” said Salem al-Muslet, spokesman for the High Negotiations Committee, Syria’s main opposition organisation.\n“What is the definition that has been chosen for ‘terrorism’?”\nAt the end of the first day of the Eid al-Adha holiday, the Syrian military announced it was ceasing operations. Turkey had earlier voiced cautious support for the ceasefire, as had two other main protagonists, Iran and Hezbollah.\nAfter spending the past year bolstering the Syrian leader, Bashar al-Assad, by bombing groups and rebel communities opposing him, Russia has emerged as the main proponent of the ceasefire. It has pledged to open aid lines to besieged areas, such as opposition-held east Aleppo and to spare rebel communities, if they disentangle themselves from jihadists.\n\nmap\n\nAhead of the ceasefire, Assad said on Monday that his government was determined to “reclaim every area from the terrorists, and to rebuild” the country. Assad spoke to the state news agency Sana during a rare public appearance on the streets of Daraya, a Damascus suburb that surrendered to government authority last month. “We call on all Syrians to turn toward reconciliation,” he said.\nOpposition groups were reportedly meeting in various parts of Syria on Monday night. Ahead of the truce, most had been wary about what it would mean, arguing there was no way to force the Syrian regime to comply, and little incentive for its backers not to use a lull to press home an advantage on the battlefield.\n\n\n\n\nPeople of Aleppo prepare for Eid festival under siege\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNevertheless, most groups are expected to cautiously endorse the pact.

One was an attempted ceasefire, while two others fell over at the negotiation table.\nIf the ceasefire does take hold, both Moscow and Washington have said they will open a joint command centre, which will agree on future targets.\nSyrian and Russian planes have taken an immense toll on civilian infrastructure since the start of the Russian intervention, with hospitals, market places and schools regularly targeted.

The degree of Russian engagement seems to be of a much greater order than of any of the previous ceasefire attempts.”\nHe said aid agencies had been given assurances at the highest level that they would be able to deliver aid over the next week if all sides complied with the agreement. \n\n\n\n\nSyria: bitter foes weigh up chance of peace, but prepare for war to rage on\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMiliband said: “If there are enough short-term interests that join the Americans and the Russians, then those of us on the humanitarian side have got a chance to try and make a difference for 17 million benighted people within the Syrian territory.”\nBut he warned that the medium-term prospects for Syria still looked bleak because of differences between Russia and the US over the future of Syria’s president, Bashar al-Assad.\nMiliband said: “The great difficulty is going to come down to the future of President Assad, because obviously in the west he is perceived as someone who has not just murdered many of his own citizens but has radicalised those who are still there. On the Russia side they see him as the great hope. And there is nothing in this agreement that gets over that fundamental division.” \n\nAreas of control in Syria\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, the rebels and the Syrian government are expected to stop attacking one another, though the regime can continue to strike at Isis and other jihadi groups, including al-Qaida’s former Syrian branch. Theoretically, Russia and the US will then establish a joint centre to combat jihadi groups.\nOne rebel group, Ahrar al-Sham, an influential Islamist force with links to al-Qaida, has already rejected the deal, saying it would only serve to strengthen Assad’s regime. \nTwo other rebel groups have written to the US saying they would cooperate, but voiced reservations. They said excluding the former al-Qaida affiliate group, Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, from the deal, but not foreign militias backed by Iran, showed double standards. They said the exclusion would be used by Russia and the Assad regime as a pretext to attack other rebel groups.\nSyria’s state news agency Sana said the Assad government “approved the agreement” for a truce. Speaking during a tour of the Damascus suburb of Daraya on Monday, Assad said: “The Syrian state is determined to recover every area from the terrorists, and to rebuild.”\n\n\n\n\nPeople of Aleppo prepare for Eid festival under siege\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLebanese Shia militia Hezbollah, which has intervened militarily on behalf of Assad, also announced its support.\nIran too welcomed the deal, but foreign ministry spokesman Bahram Ghasemi cautioned that its success relied on creating “a comprehensive monitoring mechanism, in particular control of borders in order to stop the dispatch of fresh terrorists” to Syria.\nResidents of eastern Aleppo are sceptical that aid will be delivered. “You cannot be happy when you’re living in terror,” Abo Aljood told the Guardian. \nPrevious attempts to stop the fighting and deliver humanitarian aid to Syria failed within weeks, with the United States accusing Assad’s forces of attacking opposition groups and civilians.\nThe UN said on Friday the Syrian government had effectively stopped aid convoys this month and Aleppo was close to running out of fuel, making a successful truce even more urgent.\n"

        "text": "\nDesperate residents in eastern Aleppo spent another day under intense bombardment on Wednesday and their elation at a possible rescue deal was replaced with horror as attacks on rebel territory resumed and an evacuation deal appeared to unravel in the face of Iranian opposition.\nTens of thousands of civilians trapped without food, water or medicine under a hail of artillery and airstrikes found themselves once again pawns in a geopolitical struggle, with Iranian-backed militia who had spearheaded the ground assault on eastern Aleppo defying a ceasefire agreement brokered by Russia and Turkey to allow residents and opposition fighters under siege to leave the city.\nDoctors and other civilians, who hours earlier had expressed optimism that they would be able to evacuate eastern Aleppo, again implored the international community to put a stop to the fighting that had left their homes in ruins and allow them to seek a safe haven elsewhere.\n\n\n\n\nThe battle for eastern Aleppo in maps: how rebel territory is shrinking\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“We will always remember and never forget how the criminals of the world forced Aleppo’s people to choose between two options, collective death or collective forced displacement, and we chose the lesser of the two crimes,” said one activist in a besieged opposition-held district.\nRebel officials and a source with knowledge of the negotiations indicated that Iranian intransigence had undermined the deal so far, and Iran’s proxies on the ground, some of whom have been accused of carrying out execution-style shootings of civilians, had violated the ceasefire.\nThe Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, issued a joint statement on Wednesday night urging an end to the ceasefire violations and “reaffirmed their commitment to start the evacuation of civilians and the opposition through safe corridors as soon as possible”. \nA senior rebel official said a ceasefire deal for east Aleppo had been reached on Wednesday night and civilians would began evacuating the besieged eastern districts of the city early on Thursday.\nAhmed Qaran Ali, the military spokesman of the Ahrar al Sham rebel group, said the new ceasefire would go into effect on Wednesday night and a first batch of civilians and wounded would leave the following morning.But it was unclear if Iran, which obstructed the first deal reached on Tuesday, was onboard with the new agreement.\nThe original ceasefire was agreed on Tuesday by Turkish intelligence and the Russian military. One of the rebel groups, Noureddine al-Zenki, said Iran had imposed conditions the rebels could not actually comply with.\nWhen asked about the specifics of the demands, the group’s spokesman, Yasser al-Youssef, told the Guardian they included a lifting of the siege of Fua and Kefraya, two Shia villages in Idlib province that have been surrounded by rebels for years, as well as deals on prisoners of war, wounded fighters and missing members of Iranian-backed militias.\nThe evacuation of fighters and civilians to Idlib province had been intended to begin on Wednesday morning, but buses intended to transport them – decorated with posters of the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad – returned to their depots empty hours later as the Iranian-backed militias refused to allow the evacuation to proceed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  A bus that had been intended to evacuate people from rebel-held eastern Aleppo. Photograph: Omar Sanadiki/Reuters\n\n\n“Iran has prepared to invade our besieged areas and has defied Russia’s agreement,” said al-Youssef. \nResidents said shells had also fallen on the road on which the evacuations were supposed to take place.\nAssad told Russia Today in an interview aired on Wednesday that western powers were seeking a ceasefire in Aleppo to stop the regime advance and save “the terrorists”.\nThe evacuation of rebel-held eastern Aleppo would, however, mean the opposition would cede the city, the last significant urban stronghold where it maintained an active presence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n \nVoices from Aleppo: the situation is apocalyptic – video report\n\n\nCivilians left in the opposition districts have been posting farewell messages on social media as the Iranian-backed militias and forces loyal to Assad rampaged through newly reclaimed neighbourhoods in what the UN described as a “meltdown of humanity”.\nMany predicted they would either die once the regime’s forces reached their homes, or would be detained and tortured if they gave themselves up to them.\n“Save us, people. Save us, people, world, anyone who has even a bit of humanity,” said one doctor in a voice message from a besieged district. “We beg you, we beg you, the dead and wounded are in the streets and people’s homes have collapsed on top of them. Save us. Save us.”\nAnother resident said: “We want to leave. We don’t want more massacres, let us leave. What is happening?”\nThe UN reported on Tuesday that the Iranian-backed militias, including the Iraqi Harakat al-Nujaba, had carried out at least 82 extrajudicial killings, including of women and children who were living in opposition-controlled areas. \nReports of detentions and forced recruitment into the Syrian army have also proliferated in recent days as the regime has advanced through former rebel territory.\nResidents said the bombardment on Wednesday, with artillery and airstrikes as well as alleged use of cluster bombs, had resumed at a pace greater even than before the ceasefire deal.\n\nAleppo and Idlib\n\n“This is an urgent distress call,” said another doctor, who on Tuesday night had told the Guardian he was saddened to leave Aleppo but happy that civilians would survive. \n“Save the besieged districts of Aleppo. Since the early morning, the shelling has targeted all the besieged neighborhoods with all types of weaponry. The dead are in the street, and so are the wounded, and there are no ambulances. Save Aleppo. An urgent distress call to every free person in the world.”\nAnother nurse, whose father and brother were killed on the same day earlier in the regime’s offensive, pleaded that civilians be spared. “A lot of shells and bombs are falling on us, no one can walk in the streets,” he said in a voice message. “Hundreds of shells and rockets. Please let us stay alive. Please pressure the regime to keep us safe. Please, from Aleppo, the last call.”\nHe added: “The medical situation is so bad. No ambulances, no cars, it’s a very horrible situation in our neighbourhoods. Please let our scream arrive to the whole world.”\nWeeks of immense suffering and violence in eastern Aleppo since the Syrian regime and its allies began a final push into territory that had been in rebel hands since 2012 have left residents in total despair and increasingly angry at the international community for abandoning them to their fate.\nThe US ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, told the security council late on Tuesday that the Syrian government, along with Russia and Iran, bore responsibility for the deaths of civilians in Aleppo. She accused the three states of putting a noose around civilians in the city, asking: “Are you incapable of shame? … Is there no execution of a child that gets under your skin? Is there literally nothing that shames you?”\nIranian leaders were congratulating themselves on Wednesday for the role they had played in the assault. The chief military adviser to the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said Aleppo had been “liberated thanks to a coalition between Iran, Syria, Russia and Lebanon’s Hezbollah”.\n"

        "text": "\nPresident Bashar al Assad appears heartened by the Iran nuclear deal, presuming that Tehran will continue to be his main backer. Many analysts say Assad would not have survived this long without Iran’s support, and would quickly falter without it.\nAssad may be right, but not entirely.\nWhile it is true that Iran will not abandon its hegemony over Syria, a hegemony that has grown to unprecedented levels in government-controlled areas from Damascus to Syria’s coastline, there is a flip side to this equation.\nBolstering Assad has become expensive for Iran, which has injected billions of dollars into Damascus, and has sent military and security personnel to aid Assad’s military operations in Syria. While it is difficult to know exact numbers, Iran has been public about the hundreds of casualties it is enduring in Syria so far, a cost that many Iranians may find pointless.\n\n\n\n\nThe roots of Iran's revolutionary fighters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith Iran coming in from the cold, there might be political capital to be harvested if Tehran emerged as a real broker to a resolution in Syria.\nOne way of doing this is to keep the Assad regime somewhat in tact, but without Assad himself. For months, some Syrian opposition members have been floating this idea as well, preferring it as a way of moving forward while avoiding a post-Saddam scenario, when the US dismantled the military and the entire government in Baghdad. It is a workable solution if Syrian opposition is well represented in the new, transitional government. Iran may also prefer this solution because it puts an end to a seemingly endless war, yet it maintains Tehran’s leverage over Damascus.\nAlready Turkey is calling on Iran to step up to this challenge.\nLebanon \nSometimes referred to as a country that is too small to succeed and too small to fail, Lebanon has all but lost its sovereignty entirely. It is now little more than a playing field between the region’s two super powers, Saudi Arabia and Iran.\nSo how will the Iran deal play out in Lebanon?\nIran’s proxy Lebanese militia, Hezbollah, might emerge as a winner in Lebanese politics, but it still faces some of the most challenging domestic political terrain in years. Lebanon has been imploding (and exploding) at the seams, with over 18 religious sects etching out favors between the country’s two main political alliances, the Saudi-backed “March 14” and the Iran-backed “March 8”.\n\n\n\n\nTackling Islamic State: a message from Lebanon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLebanon maintained a miraculously delicate balance in 2010, but as Syria’s uprising-turned-civil war spilled over into Lebanon, bringing with it over one million UN-registered Syrian refugees and possibly as many un-registered, the balance has tilted. Most of the Syrian refugees are Sunni Arabs, and many are not poised to return home to Syria anytime soon. How this disruptive demographical change will play out in a country born sectarian since its independence from the French Mandate in 1943 remains to be seen. (Lebanon follows a confessional system where each sect is represented by a pre-set number of representatives in parliament, and Lebanese citizens can vote only according to sect.)\nThe more immediate questions is how will Iran manage the rising dissent toward and within the ranks of Hezbollah over the militia group’s involvement in Syria’s war? Hezbollah supporters are enduring a growing number of casualties as their sons return in coffins after fighting alongside Assad’s forces in Syria. Hezbollah has been wary of Sunni-backed militants that threaten “to bring the war to Lebanon” if Hezbollah doesn’t get out of Syria. All this is unfolding in a country that has become strained to its limits, with worsening public services, inflation so high that most locals rely on remittences from relatives living abroad, and an unemployment rate so high that you hardly meet a young Lebanese not looking to emigrate.\nSaudi Arabia\nBeside Israel, Saudi is perhaps the most clear loser. For the Saudis, an Iran deal goes above and beyond concerns for regional security. The new alliance between the US and Iran is a direct affront to Saudi’s tribal sensibilities, enough reason to snub the west all together.\nThe Saudi king has not yet issued a direct public statement in reaction to the news, but the country’s stance can be gauged from what its government-sanctioned journalists and analysts are saying\n“Iran made chaos in the Arab world and will extend further after the agreement, and the GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) countries should reduce their confidence in America and turn their focus to Russia and China,” Mohammed al-Mohya, the news anchor on the state-run Saudi Channel 1, told The New York Times. He echoes a common sentiment in the Kingdom.\nMeanwhile, Saudi Arabian forces continue to pound Yemen in violation of a UN-brokered truce. Yemen perhaps best tragically captures the proxy wars between Saudi and Iran, as the country has been completely destabilized since Iran-supported Houthi rebels ousted the Saudi-friendly government in Sanaa earlier this year, prompting the fierce reaction from Riyadh.\n"
