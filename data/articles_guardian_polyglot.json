        "text": "\nThe FBI has asked officials in Cyprus for financial information about a defunct bank that was used by wealthy Russians with political connections and has been accused by the US government of money laundering, two sources have told the Guardian.\nThe request for information about FBME Bank comes as Cyprus has emerged as a key area of interest for Robert Mueller, the US special counsel who is investigating a possible conspiracy between Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign and the Kremlin.\n\n\n\n\nTrump-Russia investigation: the key questions answered\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople familiar with the FBI request told the Guardian that federal investigators and the US Treasury approached the Central Bank of Cyprus in November seeking detailed information about FBME, which was shut down this year.\nOne person familiar with the FBI request said it appeared to be connected to Mueller’s ongoing examination of Paul Manafort, the former Trump campaign manager who was indicted in October, and money that flowed between former Soviet states and the US through Cypriot banks.\nThe Central Bank of Cyprus, which in 2014 placed FBME under administration in a direct response to US action and obtained full access to the bank’s data, declined to comment. The US special counsel’s office also declined to comment. \nFBME has vigorously denied accusations that it has been a conduit for money laundering and other criminal activity. \nThe owners, Lebanese brothers Ayoub-Farid Saab and Fadi Michel Saab, issued a statement following a series of recent critical articles about the bank and denied all wrongdoing.\nBloomberg reported last week that FBME was the subject of two US investigations: one into the bank’s credit card unit, and another into alleged laundering of money from Russia. Bloomberg said the Russia-related investigation, which is being led by the US attorney’s office in New York, was connected to a flow of illegal Russian funds into the New York real estate market.\nFBME, previously known as the Federal Bank of the Middle East, was based in Tanzania but about 90% of its banking was conducted in Cyprus. A report by the US Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) in 2014 said the bank was an institution of “primary money laundering concern”.\nThe report found that the bank was evading efforts by the Central Bank of Cyprus to supervise its activities, and that FBME was facilitating money laundering, terrorist financing, transnational organised crime, fraud, sanctions evasion, weapons trading and political corruption.\nA 2014 internal report by the Central Bank of Cyprus about FBME that was obtained by the Guardian found that FBME had banking relationships with several Russians who were considered to be politically sensitive clients and that about half of the bank’s clients were Russian nationals, including Vladimir Smirnov, who is close to Putin, and Aleksandr Shishkin, a member of Putin’s political party.\nFBME was subjected in 2016 to what is known as a “fifth special measure”, a hard-hitting US regulatory tool that was established after the 9/11 attacks to address law enforcement concerns in the banking sector. The move prohibited the bank from doing business in the US or using US dollars, and barred US banks from opening or using any bank accounts on FBME’s behalf. In effect, it shut the bank down. FBME has challenged the decision but US courts have so far upheld the move.\nIt is not clear why Mueller and his team of investigators appear to be interested in FBME’s financial data. But it indicates that the special counsel is continuing to examine money flows from Cyprus.\nManafort has pleaded not guilty to charges that he laundered millions of dollars through foreign banks as part of a scheme to hide his work for political parties in Ukraine. He is accused of funnelling the funds through foreign shell companies, including many that were based in Cyprus. \nManafort’s attorney, Kevin Downing, has called the charges, including those related to his use of offshore accounts, “ridiculous”.\nA spokesman for FBME bank told the Guardian that Manafort was never a client of FBME.\nMueller’s team has separately issued a subpoena for information from Deutsche Bank. According to a person close to the bank, the subpoena was issued in the autumn. The German bank is Trump’s biggest lender.\nDeutsche also worked as a correspondent bank for FBME. Internal emails seen by the Guardian show that executives from both banks were in contact in 2014 discussing accounts that were “on the radar” of US law enforcement.\nDeutsche Bank said in a statement: “We severed our relationship with FBME in 2014 and have added more than 1,000 anti-financial crime staff in recent years to make our business safer and increase our controls.”\n",

        "title": "Azerbaijan hits back over 'scandalous' money laundering claims",
        "date": "2017-09-05T16:11:46Z",
        "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/05/theresa-may-challenged-over-azerbaijani-money-laundering-scheme",
        "text": "\nThe government of Azerbaijan has responded angrily to revelations that it ran a secret $2.9bn (£2.2bn) fund which was used to pay prominent Europeans, run lobbying operations, and launder money via a group of opaque British companies.\nAzerbaijan’s presidential aide, Ali Hasanov, said the stories by the Guardian and other media partners were a smear. In the first official reaction from Baku, Hasanov said the regime was the victim of a “scandalous” campaign organised by British intelligence, the Armenian diaspora and the US. \n“When did the Guardian write about the truth about Azerbaijan? This newspaper has been known for decades for being against Azerbaijan,” Hasanov told the Turkish newspaper Hürriyet. The reports were “biased, groundless and provocative,” he said.\nOn Tuesday, the authorities blocked access from inside Azerbaijan to the website of the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP). The OCCRP published details of the scheme, nicknamed the Azerbaijani Laundromat, following a leak of data to the Danish newspaper Berlingske.\nThe use of British companies in the Laundromat has prompted calls for Theresa May to investigate. On Tuesday May’s official spokesman said that the National Crime Agency would now examine the information from the Guardian and other media sources. The agency will “look at whether they would need to progress [to] an investigation”, the spokesman said.\nThis is the second time this year that British corporate entities have been found to be at the heart of a large-scale money laundering operation run from a former Soviet state. In March, a similar scheme run from Moscow, the $20bn Global Laundromat, was exposed.\n\n\n\n\nThe Scottish firms that let money flow from Azerbaijan to the UK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpposition politicians urged the government to act to prevent the abuse of company vehicles. Four offshore-owned British companies – based in Glasgow, Birmingham, and Potters Bar in Hertfordshire – were used to funnel money into the western financial system. It went via the Estonian branch of a Danish bank, Danske.\nTim Farron, the former Liberal Democrat leader, led calls for an inquiry, saying this was what happened “when the corporate landscape is too lightly regulated”.\n“Thanks to the Guardian investigation we learn of something called the Azerbaijani Laundromat,” he said. “But now is the time to wash some fairly dirty laundry in public and find out exactly who paid money to whom and why.\n“We need a full investigation to see that dirty money has not been used to buy influence in the UK. The Azerbaijani government is guilty of systematic human rights abuses and it would appear the regime has been making payments on an industrial scale.”\nMargaret Hodge, the chair of the all-party parliamentary group for responsible tax who uncovered the use of tax havens as chair of the public accounts committee, added to calls for more transparency. \n\n\n\n\nEverything you need to know about the Azerbaijani Laundromat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Yet again a whistleblower has lifted the lid on some unconscionably awful behaviour,” she said. “It would seem that Britain and British overseas territories are facilitating alleged corrupt practices by refusing to introduce the full transparency the Conservatives promised but failed to deliver.\n“Until we know who owns companies and properties in Britain and in the tax havens we control, such unacceptable practices will continue and Britain will be culpable because of the government’s failure to act.”\nOne London-based beneficiary of the Laundromat, Jovdat Guliyev, resigned on Monday from the Anglo-Azerbaijani Society. Guliyev received nearly £400,000 from the scheme. A former BP employee, he works for Azerbaijan’s state oil company. \nThe society’s co-chair, Liberal Democrat peer Lord German, said Guliyev quit nine minutes after the Guardian’s story went online. His name has now been removed from the Society’s website, German said, adding that none of the Laundromat payments went to the Society.\nIn an email to German, Guliyev did not explain why he had got the money but said it was legitimate and for his “personal use”.\nPeter Dowd, Labour’s chief secretary to the Treasury, said: “Money laundering hurts our economy, steals from others and corrupts our society. The financial system should effectively and efficiently provide investment that benefits the whole economy, not boost the offshore bank balances of plutocrats and criminals here and abroad.\n “We have seen too many of these shocking scandals in recent years because the Tories are incapable of taking on the rigged system, which hurts the many to support the very few.”\nMolly Scott Cato, a Green MEP who sits on the European parliament’s economics and monetary affairs committee and inquiry into the Panama Papers, said the revelations were shocking and reveal “once again that British claims to be a leader in transparency conceal a far grubbier reality”.\n“The relationship between UK companies and our murky offshore tax havens permit the world’s corrupt elite to indulge their extravagant lifestyles at public expense,” she said. “They then use these ill-gotten gains to buy political influence that prevents them from being held to account for human rights abuses and bad government.”\nThe four firms at the centre of the Azerbaijani Laundromat were all limited partnerships registered in the UK. They were: Metastar Invest, Hilux Services, Polux Management, and LCM Alliance. Their corporate “partners” are anonymous entities based in the British Virgin Islands, Seychelles and Belize.\nSome of the cash from the £2.2bn fund was used to pay for luxuries such as cars, interior design and dentistry, while other sums went to European politicians and prominent figures linked to the promotion of Azerbaijan. Seven million pounds was spent directly in the UK, including on private school fees.\nAzerbaijan’s ruling family is not directly named in the leaked documents. But evidence of a connection was overwhelming. Large sums came via the state-owned International Bank of Azerbaijan, which is the largest bank in an oil-wealthy country, and yet earlier this summer it filed for bankruptcy protection in New York. The defence and emergency situations ministries in Baku all contributed cash.\nThe scheme was used to pay for the government’s incidental expenses including the medical bills of Yaqub Eyyubov, Azerbaijan’s first deputy prime minister. There were separate payments to Eyyubov’s son Emin, Azerbaijan’s EU ambassador, and to the president’s press secretary, Azer Gasimov.\n",

        "text": "\nFive online casino companies could lose their licence to operate, after industry regulator the Gambling Commission warned they were not doing enough to stop criminals using their websites to launder money.\nThe commission has written to 17 online casino companies, flagging up the “serious nature” of its findings on their controls against money laundering, terrorist financing and problem gambling.\nThe regulator said it was already considering a licence review for five of the firms as a result of its early findings, which could result in their permission to operate in the UK being revoked.\nIn its letter to firms in the sector, the commission said it had identified failings not just in money-laundering controls, but also in social responsibility provisions designed to protect problem gamblers.\nThese included companies hiring money laundering reporting officers with no formal qualifications who were “unable to provide suitable explanations as to what constitutes money laundering”.\nThe commission said: “There was a general lack of understanding of how criminal spend could affect the business.”\nIt also said firms were not submitting enough information about suspicious activity to law enforcement agencies such as the National Crime Agency.\nOnline casinos are also failing in their duty to intervene when customers were showing signs of problem gambling, the commission said.\nThe regulator said it had spotted customers showing signs of problem gambling, but that “this behaviour did not trigger a customer interaction” by the companies.\nIt told them to improve their measures to protect customers and prevent money laundering, warning it may review whether five of the 17 operators should have their licence withdrawn.\nLabour’s deputy leader, Tom Watson, who last year launched a party review of gambling policy, said: “This serious warning shows many online gambling companies acting as if money laundering and gambling addiction being facilitated on their platforms aren’t their problem. \n“The Gambling Commission is right to demand immediate improvement. No firm that fails to take its responsibilities seriously should be allowed to hold a licence.”\nThe regulator’s chief executive, Sarah Harrison, said: “It is vital that the gambling industry takes its duty to protect consumers and keep crime out of gambling seriously. \n“The Gambling Commission’s new strategy sets out our vision for a fairer and safer gambling market. \n“The action we are taking to examine online casino operators’ compliance with money laundering and customer interaction requirements is just one example of how we will be relentless in turning that vision into reality.”\nShe said the commission was also looking at the online market, which accounts for a third of the UK gambling industry.\nThe Remote Gambling Association, the trade body for online gambling firms, said: “Keeping crime out of gambling is one of the three licensing objectives and if the commission has identified failings in this area then it must take action. \n“It would be wrong to prejudge the outcome of their investigations, but we would obviously want to work with them to raise standards wherever necessary.”\n\nFollow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.\n\n",

        "text": "\nThe Reserve Bank governor, Philip Lowe, has lashed out at the Commonwealth Bank amid allegations of systemic violations of money laundering laws, saying people must be held accountable if laws have been broken.\nLowe has also said people are unsure if US president Donald Trump is serious about cutting the US corporate tax rate to 15%, so interest in Australia’s international tax competitiveness has waned.\nSpeaking in Melbourne on Friday at a House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Lowe told MPs that public trust in Australia’s major banks had become “strained” in recent years, and the industry must start rebuilding its reputation as a priority.\n\n\n\n\nCommonwealth Bank unmasked: why the government is suing over alleged terrorism trail – explainer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe did not want to comment on specific allegations levelled at Commonwealth Bank, after a landmark lawsuit alleging systemic violations of money laundering laws, which culminated in an Australian federal police raid, but said the matter was extremely serious for CBA.\n“Banks should not be doing money laundering, and they should know who is operating the accounts that they open,” he said.\n“If shortcomings are identified, then there needs to be accountability. That accountability needs to be both through the courts and internally within the organisation.\n“It’s very serious. We have these laws for a reason. They need to be enforced and people need to be held to account,” he said.\nHe said the culture in Australia’s banking industry must be overhauled, with a focus on rebuilding trust and delivering high quality service to customers.\n“Service has taken a back seat to sales [in recent years],” he said. “The banks know that, and they’re addressing it [with] changes in remuneration structures and incentives ... there has been for too long a focus on sales and not on service.\n\n\n\n\nWages growth is at a record low – unless you're a Commonwealth Bank CEO | Greg Jericho\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“I think we can all identify examples where the desire for short-term profit has probably led to not enough attention to risk management issues.” \nHe also commented on the political interest in Australia’s headline corporate tax rate. He said people were unsure if the Trump administration was serious about cutting the US corporate rate to 15%, so the focus on Australia’s rate had diminished in recent months.\n“I remember in February when we were talking about these issues, there was the prospect of the US going down to a 15% corporate tax rate as part of President Trump’s initial plan, [but] I don’t know whether it still is,” he said.\n“The UK talked about numbers like that as well, so we were having a discussion at that time about far we could be above the international norm.\n“I have to say, since we met last time that international tax competition discussion seems to have gone away a bit, because the prospect of the US having a very large reduction in its corporate tax seems less, and if they’re not going to have that big reduction then others presumably don’t do the same thing as well.”\nWhen asked about the significance of Australia’s record-low wages growth, he warned it could turn out to be “quite persistent”.\n“How things turn out on this front is likely to have a significant bearing on the next stage in the global economic cycle,” he warned.\nBut he said Australia’s economy should be able to generate average hourly wage increases of 3.5% or more over the long run, despite the problems in the global economy, with productivity growth of 1% and average inflation of 2.5%.\n“If we really did the right things we could do 4%, but that’s really up to you – in federal parliament,” he said. \n",

        "text": "\nThe Commonwealth Bank has axed senior executive bonuses in response to a scandal around money laundering and a lawsuit by Australia’s financial intelligence agency.\nAustralia’s largest bank announced the cuts to bonuses and board pay ahead of its annual results presentation on Wednesday, amid calls for repercussions in senior ranks over claims of “serious and systemic” violations of laws to combat funding for terrorism and crime syndicates.\nIts chair, Catherine Livingstone, said the board had given “consideration to risk and reputation matters impacting the group” after the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (Austrac) launched civil proceedings in the federal court last week.\n\n\n\n\nCommonwealth Bank unmasked: why the government is suing over alleged terrorism trail – explainer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAustrac alleges the bank has made more than 53,700 breaches of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act since 2012.\nMost of the alleged violations concern late reports of large transactions through the bank’s “intelligent deposit machines” (IDMs), including by five people it assessed as possibly involved in terrorism or terrorism funding.\nAustrac also alleged the bank repeatedly failed to take appropriate action on suspicious transactions worth more than $77m, despite internal red flags and warnings from police of suspected laundering of drug profits by criminal syndicates.\nLivingstone in a statement said the board “recognises heightened public interest in executive remuneration, particularly having regard to the civil penalty proceedings initiated last week by [Austrac]”.\nShe said on Monday the board ruled that “short-term variable remuneration” for last financial year for CEO Ian Narev and other group executives would be cut to zero, while nonexecutive director pay would be cut 20% this financial year.\n“In reaching this conclusion the overriding consideration of the board was the collective accountability of senior management for the overall reputation of the group,” she said.\nBut Narev “retains the full confidence of the board”, Livingstone said.\nThe bank has blamed the “vast majority” of its alleged breaches – around late reports of large transactions to Austrac – on a “coding” error in the IDMs that went undetected for three years.\n“We recognise that there are other serious allegations in the claim unrelated to [the late reports],” it said in a statement on Monday.\nCommonwealth executives last year pocketed $16m in short-term bonuses despite a landmark shareholder rejection of its remuneration plans under Australia’s “two strikes” laws.\nThe prospect of a “second strike” against Commonwealth’s pay plans, after a 49% protest vote last year, would force a spill of the board.\nIt is unclear whether the move will head off calls for sackings of senior managers at the bank. \nJohn Abernethy, chief investment officer at Clime Asset Management, told Fairfax the board’s reaction needed to be “hard and swift”. \nHe said cutting bonuses alone was “pathetic” and “heads should go” among managers overseeing relevant areas of the bank.\nThe Austrac lawsuit in theory could give rise to a maximum fine of $18m per breach if proven – a total of $966.6bn.\nThe agency in March secured what was reportedly the largest civil penalty in Australian corporate history against Tabcorp, $45m, for breaches of the same act.\n\n\n\n\nNick Xenophon: bank CEOs should face jail if found guilty of money laundering\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestors and proxy shareholders last year were concerned a move to institute a long-term “culture bonus” linked to non-financial measures was an undue reward for Narev in the wake of scandals including around the bank’s financial planning arm. \nNarev’s pay in 2016, with bonuses and shares, has been calculated at 106 times the average Australia full-time worker’s salary at $8.6m. He stands to lose $2.8m in short-term bonuses for the last financial year. \nHe and other bank executives will forgo as much as $20m in short-term bonuses for last financial year, but long-term incentive payments remain in place.\nLivingstone faces a $174,000 pay cut but is in line to pocket around $700,000, while other nonexecutive directors will earn around $240,000.\nThe bank will release full details of pay decisions in its annual report next week.\n",

        "text": "\nCommonwealth Bank allegedly failed to act on suspicions that its network of “intelligent” deposit machines was being used by drug syndicates to launder tens of millions of dollars. \nThe Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (Austrac), the financial intelligence agency, announced on Thursday it is suing Commonwealth bank for 53,700 breaches of money laundering and counter-terrorism-financing laws.\nThe case relates to the use of intelligent deposit machines, a type of ATM launched in 2012, which allows customers to anonymously deposit and transfer cash, even when banks are closed. \nCommonwealth Bank is accused of failing to report properly on $77m worth of suspicious transactions to Austrac.\nEven when it became aware its machines were being used for suspected money laundering, the bank allegedly failed to take steps to “mitigate and manage” the risk, Austrac says.\nAustrac alleges the machines were used by four money laundering syndicates, including three linked to drug importation and distribution networks.\nThe syndicates used the machines to deposit and transfer cash, often at amounts just low enough to avoid arousing suspicion.\nOne money laundering operation saw more than $21m deposited into 11 CommBank accounts between February 2015 and May 2016, most of which came through the intelligent machines. \nThe money was allegedly the illicit proceeds of a drug importation operation, and was quickly transferred to domestic accounts. \nCommBank knew the accounts to be suspicious as early as May 2015, but failed to take proper steps to alert authorities to a number of large transactions.\nBy mid-2015, the bank was allegedly aware of unusual patterns of transactions in some of the accounts, but still didn’t alert authorities, and allowed the payments to continue. \nIt allegedly failed to act even after a warning from the Australian federal police (AFP).\n“The AFP advised Commbank in late 2015 that a number of these accounts were connected with an investigation into serious criminal offences, including ‘drug important and unlawful processing of money’,” Austrac alleged in its statement of claim. \n“CommBank permitted several of the accounts to remain open even after this time and further transactions occurred. Eight individuals have been charged with dealing in proceeds of crime, with 6 of these individuals already having been convicted.”\nAnother syndicate involved three people who deposited $2.2m into three CommBank accounts between June 2014 and January 2015. The money was almost immediately transferred to money remitters. \nCommBank became aware of the suspicious transactions involving the first of the accounts in July 2014, and the other two soon after.\n“However CommBank continued to allow these individuals to transact on these accounts until they were each arrested on 19 January 2015,” Austrac’s statement of claim alleges.\n“These three individuals have been charged with dealing in proceeds of crime, in connections with a drug importation syndicate, with one already convicted.”\nAnother syndicate involved foreign nationals in Australia on holiday visas, who deposited $20.59m into 30 accounts with fake names between late 2014 and August 2015.\nThe vast majority of that money was transferred offshore, and the deposits were “structured”, or kept at low enough levels that they would not arouse suspicion. \nIn April 2015, CommBank became aware of “repeated suspicious and connected patterns of structured cash deposits followed by international money transfers”, Austrac alleges. \n“Notwithstanding this suspicion, between April and 1 July 2015, Commbank permitted approximately $9.1m to be transferred from these accounts to Hong Kong,” Austrac alleged in its statement of claim. \n\n\n\n\nCommonwealth Bank's new Eftpos system makes blind people reveal pin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAustrac also alleges the bank failed to assess the risk that the machines would be used for money laundering or terror financing before their rollout in 2012. \n“CBA took no steps to assess the [money laundering/terror financing] risk until mid-2015 – three years after they were introduced,” Austrac said in a statement.\nIn total, Austrac has alleged the bank failed to comply with its obligations in monitoring transactions on 778,370 accounts over a period of three years.\nThe bank allegedly failed to provide a total of 53,506 reports – known as threshold transaction reports – to Austrac on time for cash transactions of $10,000 or more from November 2012 to September 2015.\n“These late [threshold transaction reports] represent approximately 95% of the threshold transactions that occurred through the bank’s [intelligence deposit machines] from November 2012 to September 2015 and had a total value of around $624.7m,” Austrac said.\nThe regulator will take the case to the federal court, seeking a civil penalty. \nThe Austrac acting chief executive, Peter Clark, said businesses were at risk of being misused for criminal purposes if they failed to have proper money laundering and counter-terrorism financing systems and controls. \n“Austrac’s goal is to have a financial sector that is vigilant and capable of responding, including through innovation, to threats of criminal exploitation,” Clark said.\n“We believe this can be achieved by working collaboratively with and supporting industry. We will continue to work in this way with our industry partners who also share this aim and demonstrate a strong commitment to it,” he said. \nA statement issued by Commonwealth Bank acknowledged the case and said it had cooperated fully with Austrac.\n“We have been in discussions with Austrac for an extended period and have cooperated fully with their requests,” the statement said. “Over the same period we have worked to continuously improve our compliance and have kept Austrac abreast of those efforts, which will continue.”\nThe bank said it took its regulatory obligations “extremely seriously”. It said it was one of the largest reporters to Austrac.\n“On an annual basis we report over four million transactions to Austrac in an effort to identify and combat any suspicious activity as quickly and efficiently as we can,” the statement said. \n“We have invested more than $230m in our anti-money laundering compliance and reporting processes and systems, and all of our people are required to complete mandatory training on the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act.\n“We are reviewing the nature of the proceedings and will have more to say on the specific claims in due course.”\nIntelligent deposit machines have become responsible for vast deposits of money since their launch in 2012. More than $1bn was deposited in both May and June last year alone. \n",

        "text": "\nThe Trump Ocean Club International Hotel and Tower soars over Panama City bay, a 70-storey skyscraper shaped like a sail. Donald Trump’s first international hotel venture, it opened in 2011, a mix of condominiums, hotel rooms and a casino.\nAs one of the tallest structures in Latin America, it was a bold and lucrative expression of the Trump brand, earning him as much as $13.9m in management fees and royalties in the last three years.\nBy day it glints in the tropical sunshine, an apparently shining testament to the US president’s business savvy.\nBut a curious thing happens at night. Many of the lights stay off. The restaurants are near deserted; the corridors silent. The skyscraper appears to be largely empty – a dark tower.\nMany of those who bought the condos, it turns out, did so not to live there but allegedly to launder illicit money – Russian gangster money, drug cartel money, people-smuggling money. \nA joint Reuters-NBC News investigation published on Friday alongside a report by the non-profit Global Witness said the skyscraper with Trump’s name had ties to international organised crime.\nThe reports detailed how the future president gave the project to his daughter Ivanka as a “baby” effort to gain real estate experience, and said it ended up drawing a cast of characters accused of fraud, corruption and kidnapping.\nTrump may not have intended to facilitate criminal activity but the Panama tower “aligned” his financial interests with crooks, said Global Witness. “Trump seems to have done little to nothing to prevent this. What is clear is that proceeds from Colombian cartels’ narcotics trafficking were laundered through the Trump Ocean Club and that Donald Trump was one of the beneficiaries.”\nThere is no evidence that the Trump Organization or members of the Trump family broke the law or knew of the criminal backgrounds of some of the tower’s brokers, buyers and investors.\nThe White House and Ivanka Trump referred requests for comment to the Trump Organization, which issued a statement distancing itself from the tower. \n“The Trump Organization was not the owner, developer or seller of the Trump Ocean Club Panama project. Because of its limited role, the company was not responsible for the financing of the project and had no involvement in the sale of units or the retention of any real estate brokers.”\nThe story may endure. The president won last year’s election on the promise of draining corruption in Washington and building a wall to keep out drugs and undesirable immigrants. Robert Mueller, the special counsel who is investigating Russian influence in the election, is looking at Trump’s business dealings.\nTrump lent his name but did not exert management control over the tower’s construction and was under no direct legal obligation to conduct due diligence on other people involved.\nBut Arthur Middlemiss, a former assistant district attorney in Manhattan and a former head of JP Morgan’s global anti-corruption program, told Reuters that since Panama was “perceived to be highly corrupt”, anyone engaged in business there should conduct due diligence on business collaborators. If they did not, he said, there was a potential risk in US law of being liable for turning a blind eye to wrongdoing.\nTrump wanted to use the Panama project as a “baby” for Ivanka, Roger Khafif, a Panamian developer who pitched the deal to Trump in 2005, told Reuters.\nShe helped kickstart the project a year later by selecting a Brazilian former car salesman, Alexandre Ventura Nogueira, as a lead broker to sell units. He promised quick sales at high prices. Ventura’s firm, Homes Real Estate Investment & Services, delivered, selling 350 to 400 units, about $100m worth of property, he told Reuters and NBC.\nHe met Ivanka numerous times, met her brothers Eric and Donald Jr, and met the future president once, at a celebratory event in 2008 at Mar-a-Lago, the family’s Florida estate. \nA year later, however, Ventura was arrested in Panama for real estate fraud, unrelated to the Trump project, and fled on bail. \nNow a fugitive, the 43-year-old spoke from an undisclosed European city wearing a disguise.\nVentura said some of his brokers and clients who traded units in the Trump Ocean Club were connected to the Russian mafia and other organised crime groups.\nHe said he sold seven to 10 units to David Murcia Guzmán, a disgraced entrepreneur who is currently in US custody awaiting extradition to Colombia after being convicted by a US federal court of laundering money for drug cartels, including through real estate. \nVentura said he sold about half the units to Russian-speaking brokers, including Arkady Vodovozov, who, according to court files cited by Reuters, was convicted of kidnapping in Israel, and Igor Anapolskiy, who, according to Ukrainian court documents cited by Global Witness, was convicted in 2014 of forging travel documents.\nAnother was Stanislav Kavalenka, who, according to Ontario court documents, was charged in Canada with “compelling” and “procuring” women to engage in prostitution. The case was later withdrawn.\nMany buyers remained unidentified because many units were bought and sold through anonymous shell companies. Ventura said he set up hundreds of such corporations, charging roughly $1,000 each.\n“I had some customers with questionable backgrounds,” he said. “Nobody ever asked me. Banks never asked. Developer didn’t ask and (the) Trump Organization didn’t ask. Nobody ask: ‘Who are the customers, where did the money come from?’ No, nobody ask.”\nMauricio Ceballos, a former financial crimes prosecutor in Panama who investigated Ventura, told NBC the skyscraper was a “vehicle for money laundering”.\nAlan Garten, the Trump Organization’s chief legal officer, played down Ventura’s connections with the Trumps, telling Reuters they did not remember meeting him, and that such contacts would have been “meaningless” and just one of hundreds of public appearances they make each year. \n",

        "text": "\nThe shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has called for an inquiry into London’s role in global money laundering, amid concern about UK banks’ exposure to a corruption investigation into ties between South Africa’s wealthy Gupta family and President Jacob Zuma.\nSpeaking after it emerged that the FBI is to examine any links between US companies and individuals to the Gupta affair (£), McDonnell said London had become “notorious” as a centre for money-laundering.\n\n\n Q&A Who are the Gupta brothers?  \n\n\n Show \n\n\n Hide  \n\n\nAjay, Atul and Rajesh Gupta are Indian-born entrepreneurs at the centre of a corruption investigation in South Africa.\nThe brothers, who moved to South Africa in 1993, have denied a string of allegations about alleged corruption. The key allegation levelled against them is that they have used their ties to Jacob Zuma, the country’s president, to advance their own business interests.\nThe scandal has already claimed the scalp of UK public relations firm Bell Pottinger. It went into administration after it was accused of deliberately stirring up racial tensions in South Africa while working for a Gupta holding company, Oakbay Investment.\n\n\n\n\nWas this helpful?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you for your feedback.\n\n\n\n\nThe warning comes after the Guardian revealed that the chancellor, Philip Hammond, has asked UK authorities to look into whether HSBC and Standard Chartered were involved in transactions related to the Guptas.\nStandard Chartered said on Thursday it had closed bank accounts in 2014 due to concerns about potential links to the scandal. HSBC has yet to comment.\nThe potential involvement of UK banks was first raised by former Labour cabinet minister Peter Hain, who grew up in South Africa and was a prominent anti-apartheid activist.\nLord Hain called on the chancellor last month to ask UK authorities to examine transactions involving 27 people and 14 companies, including Zuma and Gupta family members.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor. Photograph: Victoria Jones/PA\n\n\nHe followed up his concerns on Thursday by asking in the House of Lords for an update on the government’s progress in investigating bank accounts “suspected to have been set up for the purposes of transnationally laundering an estimated £400m [...] of their illicit proceeds”.\nHain said UK banks “must have been conduits for the corrupt proceeds of money stolen from [South African] taxpayers and laundered through Dubai and Hong Kong”.\nSpeaking after Hain’s question, Lord Davies warned the government it must act fast to ensure the UK’s reputation as a financial centre is not affected.\n“It’s quite clear that a number of British banks have got clear and significant interests in South Africa,” Lord Davies said.\n“It’s important now that action is taken to make sure these banks are clear of this corruption and, if not, that action is taken against them.\n“It will not do Britain’s reputation any good at all to be tardy on this very significant issue.”\nSpeaking on behalf of the government, Conservative life peer Lord Bates said: “We’re taking this very seriously because we realise the consequence of not doing so for the reputation of the City of London and the UK.”\nIn a statement following Hain’s intervention in the House of Lords, McDonnell called on the government to consider a wide-ranging review into the role of UK financial institutions in global corruption.\n“This is the third high-profile money-laundering scandal to involve major British banks this year, and London has become notorious as a global centre for money laundering,” he said\n“There are many hardworking people in our banking sector who will feel frustrated and dismayed by such stories, but they are let down by poor leadership and weak oversight that undermines the financial sector’s reputation. “It’s time the chancellor considered a wide-ranging independent inquiry that leaves no stone unturned in rooting out unlawful and damaging activity. \n“The government cannot continue to drag its feet on this matter as it will be the British banking industry as a whole that risks long-term damage to the reputation on which it depends.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\nThe chancellor has asked the Serious Fraud Office, National Crime Agency and the Financial Conduct Authority to seek information from HSBC and Standard Chartered about their potential involvement with transactions related to the Guptas.\n“We are not able to comment on the details of client transactions but can confirm that following an internal investigation accounts were closed by us in 2014,” said Standard Chartered.\nIt did not comment on the nature of the transactions but it is believed to have had concerns about indirect links to the Guptas, rather than accounts held at the bank. \nThe inquiry into links between the Guptas and Zuma, a longstanding relationship known colloquially as “Zupta” in South Africa, has also attracted FBI attention, it emerged on Thursday.\nUS investigators have begun investigating individuals, bank accounts and companies potentially linked to the scandal, according to the Financial Times.\nZweli Mkhize, the treasurer general of South Africa’s ruling ANC party – and one of the most senior officials in the organisation – welcomed the international dimension to the investigation.\n“If there is any information suggesting corruption or irregularities it needs to be investigated across the borders, not to be restricted to South Africa,” he said.\n“We may not be aware of the exact issues for companies not within South Africa but we will welcome any information that might help to shed light on what is happening in our country if it arrives from other countries. \n“So if the UK and US authorities are involved in an investigation we will keep ourselves interested in anything that involves companies that ultimately work in South Africa.”\nThe “Guptagate” affair has already claimed the scalp of UK public relations firm Bell Pottinger, which counted Gupta holding company Oakbay Investments as a client. Its business collapsed when it was struck off by the UK PR industry body for its work with Oakbay. \nThe South African bosses of accounting firm KPMG, which audited Gupta family businesses, also quit amid the fallout from the affair.\n",

        "text": "\nVijay Mallya, the flamboyant multimillionaire co-owner of the Force India Formula One team and self-proclaimed “King of the Good Times”, was arrested on Tuesday over allegations of supporting his F1 team with money-laundered cash.\nThe Indian government accuses Mallya, 61, of fleeing to the UK to avoid arrest in relation to £1bn of unpaid debts. The crown prosecution service said Mallya was re-arrested on Tuesday on behalf of Indian authorities. “The new charge is essentially showing where the money went to, for example, it is alleged that some of the funds ended up with the Force India racing team,” said the CPS.\nMallya denied the charges and was released on bail after a brief appearance at Westminster magistrates’ court. “I deny all allegations that have been made and I will continue to deny them,” he said outside court. “I have not eluded any court. If it is my lawful duty to be here, I’m happy to be here.”\nMallya was first arrested in April following the Indian’s government request for his extradition to stand trail over an alleged debt of 94bn rupees (£1bn) owed to state-owned banks after the collapse of Kingfisher Airlines in 2012.\nThe businessman, who is living in a £11.5m Hertfordshire mansion once owned by the father of F1 driver Lewis Hamilton, is due back in court on 20 November and an extradition hearing is due to start on 4 December. \nMallya was once known as the “Branson of Bangalore” for his business and sport empire which included beer, spirits and an airline. But he has fallen from a billionaire playboy, known for his beer company Kingfisher’s take on the Pirelli calendar and for hosting celebrity parties on his 311ft superyacht Indian Empress during the Monte Carlo Grand Prix, to facing extradition from the UK.\nMallya has been spotted being driven by a chauffeur around London in a silver Maybach bearing the initials VJM on its number plate. His private Airbus A319 jet had the initials painted in gold on the engines and wingtips until it was put up for auction.\nMore than 4,000 Kingfisher Airlines employees went without pay for seven months before they revolted and grounded the carrier in October 2012.\n",

        "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/04/uk-at-centre-of-secret-3bn-azerbaijani-money-laundering-and-lobbying-scheme",
        "text": "\nAzerbaijan’s ruling elite operated a secret $2.9bn (£2.2bn) scheme to pay prominent Europeans, buy luxury goods and launder money through a network of opaque British companies, an investigation by the Guardian reveals.\nLeaked data shows that the Azerbaijani leadership, accused of serial human rights abuses, systemic corruption and rigging elections, made more than 16,000 covert payments from 2012 to 2014. \nSome of this money went to politicians and journalists, as part of an international lobbying operation to deflect criticism of Azerbaijan’s president, Ilham Aliyev, and to promote a positive image of his oil-rich country. There is no suggestion that all the recipients were aware of the original source of the money. It arrived via a disguised route. \n\n\n\n\nThe Scottish firms that let money flow from Azerbaijan to the UK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the revelations once again highlight the use of the lightly regulated British corporate landscape to move large sums of money around, beyond the purview of regulators and tax authorities. Seven million pounds was spent in Britain on luxury goods and private school fees.\nThe cash, contributed by an opaque array of paymasters in Azerbaijan and Russia, travelled to the British companies – all limited partnerships registered at Companies House in London – via the western financial system without raising red flags. One of Europe’s leading banks, Danske, processed the payments via its branch office in Estonia.\nDanske Bank said “money laundering and other illegal practices” had taken place. It first noticed the irregular payments in 2014. Estonia’s financial regulator said systems designed to stop money laundering at the branch had failed.\n\nAzerbaijani Laundromat\n\nThe scheme has been nicknamed the Azerbaijani Laundromat. Confidential banking records were leaked to the Danish newspaper Berlingske and shared with the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), the Guardian, and other media partners. The data covers a 30-month period. It may show the tip of an iceberg.\nThe politicians\nThe leaked bank records show multiple payments to several former members of the Council of Europe’s parliamentary assembly, Pace. One is Eduard Lintner, a German ex-MP and member of the Christian Social Union, the Bavarian sister party to Angela Merkel’s ruling Christian Democrats. Another is the Italian former chair of the centre-right group in Pace, Luca Volontè.\nThe payments came at a time when Azerbaijan was under fire for arresting human rights activists and journalists, and for holding rigged elections. The regime sought to blunt criticism from Europe and the US by allegedly bribing delegates in what has been called “caviar diplomacy”. \nThis intensive lobbying operation was so successful that Council of Europe members voted against a 2013 report critical of Azerbaijan.\n\n\n\n\nEverything you need to know about the Azerbaijani Laundromat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLintner stood down as an MP in 2010, but remained a firm supporter of Azerbaijan. He founded the Society for the Promotion of German-Azerbaijani Relations in Berlin, which received €819,500 (£755,000). One €61,000 payment was made two weeks after Lintner returned to Berlin from a trip to Azerbaijan where he monitored the country’s 2013 presidential election. He said the poll was up to “German standards” – in direct contrast to official election observers who found “significant problems”.\nLintner says he received the money for his society, did not personally benefit, and was not an MP or Council of Europe member at the time. An Azerbaijani NGO paid for his election trip, he says. He says he has no knowledge of the original source of the payments received. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Luca Volontè. Photograph: Vano Shlamov/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\nDetails of cash given to Volontè emerged in 2016 and caused outrage. He received more than €2m in instalments via his Italian-based Novae Terrae foundation. Prosecutors in Milan have indicted him for money laundering and corruption.\nVolontè denies wrongdoing. He is seeking to have the case thrown out. \nThe data also shows money being paid via the British companies to Kalin Mitrev, a Bulgarian appointed last year to the board of the London-based European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Mitrev received at least €425,000 for private consulting work from a local Azeri company, Avuar Co. He acknowledges the payments and says they were for legitimate business consultancy. He denies all knowledge of the conduit used to execute them or the original source of the funds. \n“All the income, generated by activities in different countries, was duly reported and taxed in my country of residence, Bulgaria,” Mitrev said. His consultancy work stopped when he joined the London bank, he said.\nThe revelation that her husband consulted for an Azeri company might prove awkward for Mitrev’s wife, Irina Bokova, who is the director general of Unesco. Bokova has bestowed one of Unesco’s highest honours, the Mozart Medal on Azerbaijan’s first lady and vice-president, Mehriban Aliyeva. She also hosted a photo exhibition at Unesco’s headquarters in Paris, entitled Azerbaijan – A Land of Tolerance. The Heydar Aliyev foundation organised the event.\n\nAzerbaijani Laundromat how it works\n\nAsked by the Guardian whether there was a conflict between her husband’s work and her UN role, she strongly denied this, saying she had no knowledge of her husband’s business affairs. “As a director general of a UN agency, my duty is to develop sound working relations with all members of the organisation in conformity with the policies set by member states. Azerbaijan is not an exception in this respect.” \n“I am immensely proud of my determined pursuit of the mandate of Unesco, including in the area of human rights, freedom of expression and the safety of journalists.” \nThe lobbyists\nLarge sums from the scheme were spent on lobbying. In 2014 Eckart Sager, a former CNN producer based in London, received nearly €2m from the British companies. His PR company is linked to articles that promote the Azerbaijani government and its views. One piece denies wrongdoing by Baku in the Volontè case. Sager did not comment.\nAnother beneficiary is a London-based Azeri, Jovdat Guliyev, who received 25 payments totalling almost £400,000. Guliyev is a member of the Anglo-Azerbaijani Society, a lobby group co-chaired by the Liberal Democrat peer Lord German. Guliyev did not respond to repeated messages asking him for a comment. \nThe British connection\nThe four firms at the centre of the Azerbaijani Laundromat were all limited partnerships registered in the UK. They were: Metastar Invest, based at a service address in Birmingham; Hilux Services and Polux Management, set up in Glasgow; and LCM Alliance, from Potters Bar, Hertfordshire. Their corporate “partners” are anonymous tax haven entities based in the British Virgin Islands, Seychelles and Belize.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Glasgow, where two of the four firms at the centre of the Azerbaijani Laundromat were set up. Photograph: Mark Liddell#118848/Flickr Vision\n\n\nL Burke Files, an international financial investigator, said these company structures were “purposefully opaque”. Foreign criminals used Scottish limited partnerships, or SLPs, he said. In June the government announced SLPs would have to name their significant owners, or pay fines, amid evidence of growing fraud.\n “No one suspects Scotland. It’s never been on the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) list of non-compliant countries,” Files said. “If you are going to launder money it’s probably best not to run it between Russia, Malta and the Cayman Islands. Does Scotland raise a red flag in your mind? No.”\nAll four British companies are named as payment channels in the Italian prosecution case against Volontè. They have since been dissolved.\nLuxury services\nThe banking data shows that the Azerbaijani fund was used for a wide variety of purposes. More than $2.9bn went to companies, with about $50m paid out to individuals. Many beneficiaries were retail and service firms in western Europe. In all probability, they would have been unaware of the origins of the payments they were receiving.\nSome of the 200 money transfers to the UK concerned education. In 2014 £89,800 was transferred to Queen Ethelburga’s Collegiate, a private boarding school in York. The school would not identify the pupil or pupils involved or comment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Queen Ethelburga’s Collegiate. Photograph: PR\n\n\nThere were payments to the tuition college Bellerbys and to the ICS international school in London. Bellerbys said it was investigating. The data suggests there were a number of relatively modest bursaries to regime-connected Azerbaijani students studying in Britain, as well as rental deposits on upmarket London flats. Other purchases included designer dresses, luxury cars and legal fees. There is no suggestion the UK recipients should have known about the provenance of the money. \nAzerbaijan’s ruling family is not directly named. But the evidence of a connection is overwhelming. Large sums come via the state-owned International Bank of Azerbaijan. This is the largest bank in an oil-wealthy country, and yet earlier this summer it filed for bankruptcy protection in New York. The defence and emergency situations ministries in Baku all chip in cash.\nThe scheme was used to pay for the government’s incidental expenses including the medical bills of Yaqub Eyyubov, Azerbaijan’s first deputy prime minister. There were separate payments to Eyyubov’s son Emin, Azerbaijan’s EU ambassador, and to the president’s press secretary, Azer Gasimov.\nBusiness partners of the US president, Donald Trump, in a project to build a luxury Trump Tower in Baku also appear in the Laundromat scheme.\nThe hotel’s local developer was Anar Mammadov, the billionaire son of Azerbaijan’s ex-transport minister Ziya Mammadov. At the time the scheme operated, the Mammadovs were one of the country’s most powerful and wealthy families. The Mammadovs’ Baghlan holding company is linked to Laundromat transactions.\n\n\n\nAnar Mammadov posts a picture of himself with Ivanka Trump after her father’s US election win\n\n\nIn 2012 the Trump Organisation signed a deal with the Mammadovs to build a 33-floor, 130-metre-high “ultra-modern” skyscraper. In October 2014 Ivanka Trump toured Trump Tower Baku, posting photos of the unfinished building on her Instagram account. The hotel never opened. Trump has since cut his connection with the project. The Laundromat scheme does not link to Trump but raises questions about his choice of business partners. \nThe paymasters\nIt is not entirely clear where the money used in the scheme comes from. The Russian government paid $29.4m into the Laundromat via its main weapons company, Rosoboronexport. Several transactions link to another $20bn money-laundering scheme, which operated out of Moscow between 2010 and 2014. The scheme, the Global Laundromat, was exposed in March by the OCCRP, Novaya Gazeta and the Guardian.\nA mysterious private firm in Baku, Baktelekom MMC, pays in more than $1.4bn. The firm is what fraud experts call a doppelganger entity. It sounds like the state telecoms firm with the same name but bears no relation to it. It doesn’t have a website. Its function is unclear. According to the OCCRP, Baktelekom MMC is linked to Mehriban Aliyeva. In January the company was let off a $17.4m tax bill.\nThe Danish bank Danske said it had not been good enough at monitoring suspicious transactions at its Estonian branch. The bank has since “tightened procedures and controls” and “terminated relationships” with some customers. \n“We will not accept Danske being exploited for money laundering or other criminal purposes. We will do everything to prevent it from happening again,” it said.\n Madis Reimand, the head of Estonia’s financial intelligence unit, said his office had come across the suspicious Azerbaijani cash flows in 2013 while analysing a separate case. “From there we followed the tracks,” he said. “We tried to cooperate with the source country in order to ascertain where the money came from. This, however, didn’t work out.”\nReimand said Estonia’s financial supervisory authority had identified what had gone wrong and taken steps to prevent similar fraud in the future.\n\nClarification: It has been suggested to us by Kalin Mitrev that this article may be understood as alleging that he was involved in corruption and/or money laundering in association with the Azerbaijani Laundromat. Whilst we do not agree with Mr Mitrev that the article conveys such a meaning, we are happy to make it clear that that we did not intend to suggest this.\n\n",

        "date": "2017-07-18T20:30:22Z",
        "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/18/trump-jr-russia-meeting-irakly-ike-kaveladze",
        "text": "\nA Russian American businessman once accused of laundering more than $1.4bn into the US from eastern Europe attended the meeting where Donald Trump’s son expected to receive secret information from Moscow.\nIrakly “Ike” Kaveladze was the eighth participant in the notorious get-together at Trump Tower in Manhattan on 9 June 2016, his attorney Scott Balber confirmed to the Guardian on Tuesday. Kaveladze’s attendance was first reported by CNN. \nKaveladze, 52, is an executive at a Moscow-based property firm owned by Aras Agalarov, a business associate of Trump who is also enmeshed in the controversy over the meeting during last year’s presidential election campaign. \nTrump’s son Donald Jr agreed to the meeting after being told by email that he would be given damaging information about Hillary Clinton, their Democratic opponent, as part of an effort by the Russian government to support Trump.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Irakly ‘Ike’ Kaveladze. Photograph: Twitter\n\n\nThe meeting brought together Donald Jr and two other senior campaign aides with Natalia Veselnitskaya, a Russian lawyer with ties to the Kremlin, and Rinat Akhmetshin, a Russian American political operative and former military officer.\nKaveladze was in 2000 named by the New York Times as responsible for using about 2,000 shell companies in the US to launder $1.4bn from Russia and eastern Europe into accounts at Citibank and the Commercial Bank of San Francisco.\nA report by the US Government Accountability Office (GAO) on the alleged scheme did not identify Kaveladze by name but confirmed the involvement of his company, International Business Creations. “It is possible that these transfers were used to launder money,” the report said of the transactions.\nKaveladze and Balber, his attorney, did not respond to questions on Tuesday about his alleged involvement in money laundering. Charles Young, a spokesman for the GAO, said he could not independently confirm reports of Kaveladze’s involvement.\nDisclosures about the Trump Tower meeting have intensified concerns over what US intelligence services say was a concerted campaign by Russia to sway the 2016 election. Emails released by Trump Jr last week gave the first confirmation that the campaign at least tried to collude with that effort.\nIn the days before the meeting, Donald Jr sent an email eagerly welcoming the offer of damaging information on Clinton, which was described as “part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr Trump” by a go-between operating on behalf of Agalarov, the Russian real estate tycoon.\n\n\n\n\nThe Trumps of Russia? How billionaire Agalarov family ended up in the spotlight\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat go-between was Rob Goldstone, a British music publicist who represents Agalarov’s son Emin, a well-known pop singer in Russia. Goldstone, Kaveladze, Akhmetshin, Veselnitskaya and a translator were joined by Trump Jr; the then Trump campaign chairman, Paul Manafort; and Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and adviser.\nAll are likely to come under the scrutiny of simultaneous inquiries into the Russian campaign that are being conducted by two congressional committees and Robert Mueller, a former FBI director who is serving as a special counsel on the subject. Kushner, now a senior White House official, originally failed to note the meeting in paperwork submitted when he took his government job, which was illegal.\nDonald Trump Sr and his supporters have tried to paint the meeting as an unremarkable attempt to glean some useful “opposition research” for the rough-and-tumble of national politics. \nNumerous veterans of presidential campaigns for both parties reject this, insisting that the appropriate response would have been for the Trump team to report the Russians to the FBI.\nAkhmetshin, the Russian American political operative, has said Veselnitskaya, the Russian attorney, gave the Trump campaign aides a plastic sheath of documents during the meeting, calling into question claims by Trump Jr that she offered “no meaningful information” and that the meeting concerned Russia’s ban on children being adopted by Americans.\nSign up for the Minute email.

        "text": "\nBritain is struggling to stop vast sums of potentially criminal money entering the country because investigators are being hampered by the Russian authorities, the head of the National Crime Agency money laundering unit has said.\nIn an interview with the Guardian, David Little said: “The amount of Russian money coming into the UK is a concern. “One, because of the volume. Two, we don’t know where it is coming from. We don’t have enough cooperation [from the Russian side] to establish that. They won’t tell us whether it comes from the proceeds of crime.”\nLabour has been granted an urgent question in the Commons on the subject. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, will raise the issue at 12.30pm on Tuesday in a debate, with a government minister responding.\nLittle, who is head of the NCA’s money laundering and corruption intelligence desk, said his team exchanged information with the Russian Financial Investigation Unit. \nBut he hinted that frosty diplomatic relations between the UK and Moscow, and the murky internal politics of Russia itself, made it impossible to pursue leads.\n He pointed to the “wider relationship issues that exist within Russia”, adding: “Overall, the [UK-Russia relationship], it’s very challenging.”\nOn Monday, the Guardian revealed that police in eastern Europe have been investigating how at least $20bn was moved out of Russia during a four-year period from 2010.\nDetectives have exposed a money laundering scheme, called the “Global Laundromat”, that was run by Russian criminals with links to their government and the former KGB.\nDocuments seen by the Guardian show British-registered firms played a prominent role in the money laundering network – and the UK’s high street banks processed $740m from the operation without turning back any of the payments.\n The banking records were obtained by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) and Novaya Gazeta from sources who wish to remain anonymous. OCCRP shared the data with the Guardian and media partners in 32 countries.\nThe documents include details of around 70,000 banking transactions, including 1,920 that took place in the UK and 373 in the US.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n \nThe Global Laundromat: where the money went\n\n\nThe data is understood to be part of the evidence gathered in a money laundering investigation led by police in Moldova and Latvia that has been running for three years.\nLittle said the NCA had been in touch with the authorities in Moldova since 2014 about the Global Laundromat, which he described as “big and pretty unusual”.\nHe acknowledged that UK banks had taken steps to identify laundered money, but insisted they needed to spend more on compliance, even though it “isn’t the part of the bank that makes money”.\n“I think the [banks] have significant challenges. Twenty million transactions go through the City and in trades through the money markets each day. A vast amount of business, and only a small amount will be money laundering.\n“It’s the size of the challenge which is the problem. It’s beyond a human scale. The sophisticated money launderer will know the tolerances that will trigger alerts. There are pretty smart guys out there. This needs more sophisticated solutions than throwing people at it. It’s not just about the size of the staff.\n “[The banks] are improving but they can still get better.”\n\n\n\n\nHow 'dirty money' from Russia flooded into the UK – and where it went\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle said he thought it was likely that other sophisticated, long-running schemes like the Laundromat were still being used by criminals.\n“Typically these schemes operate for a number of years. The money moves through it. It keeps churning away until something triggers it [to stop]. These are the most dangerous schemes.”\nHe said the NCA would be reviewing its work on the Laundromat in the light of the revelations.\n“We have an interest in all money laundering schemes like this, particularly where UK structures appear to have facilitated it.”\nRobert Barrington, the executive director of Transparency International UK, said the revelations of the UK’s role in financial crime should “come as no surprise to anyone”.\n“A year after the Panama Papers, we can see that the anti-money laundering supervisors have been asleep on the job, the banks have been at best lax and at worst complicit, and the UK’s law enforcement agencies have a dismal track record of investigations that lead to prosecutions.\n“Basically, the UK’s anti-money laundering defences are just not fit for purpose. The government needs a concerted, world-class strategy to deal with this if it’s going to convince people that we are not in a post-Brexit race to the bottom in which corrupt money is welcomed to the UK with open arms.”\nBarrington said it was good that that criminal finances bill was currently before parliament, but added: “The bad news is that at last year’s anti-corruption summit, the government promised to publish a national anti-corruption strategy by December, and there is no sign of it.”\nRoman Borisovich, a former banker and anti-corruption campaigner, said the British government needed to do more to end offshore secrecy. It should identify the real owners of offshore companies doing business or owning assets in the UK.\n“In Russia I have witnessed an entire shadow industry of money laundering engineered by professional financiers and operated by organised criminal groups under the Kremlin’s watchful eye,” he said. \nAccording to the Central Bank of Russia, capital flight out of Russia during the Vladimir Putin years exceeded $1tn, he said. “We have no idea yet how the other $900m got across the Russian border – but rest assured they ended up in the same banks.”\nHSBC, the Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds, Barclays and Coutts are among 17 banks based in the UK, or with branches here, that are facing questions over what they knew about the international scheme and why they did not turn away suspicious money transfers.\nHSBC processed $545.3m in Laundromat cash, mostly routed through its Hong Kong branch. The troubled RBS, which is 71% owned by the UK government, handled $113.1m. Coutts, which is owned by RBS and used by the Queen, accepted $32.7m of payments via its office in Zurich, Switzerland.\n Coutts is winding down its Swiss operation and was last month fined by regulators for money laundering in a different case.\nRBS said in a statement that also covered Coutts and NatWest: “We are committed to combating financial crime and money laundering in line with our regulations and have controls and safeguards in place to identify, assess, monitor and mitigate these risks.”\nHSBC said: “This case highlights the need for greater information sharing between the public and private sectors, each of whom holds important information the other does not.”\n",

        "text": "\nFraud investigators have launched a review of the activities of Britain’s high street banks following revelations in the Guardian about a $20bn money laundering scam that MPs described as a national disgrace and scandal.\nForced to answer urgent questions in the House of Commons, the Treasury minister Simon Kirby announced the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the National Crime Agency (NCA) would be examining allegations that Britain’s banks processed vast amounts of tainted money from Russian criminals without noticing.\nBut in sometimes bruising exchanges, Kirby was criticised by MPs from all sides for giving complacent answers to questions, and for failing to acknowledge the ease with which such cash can be transferred through London, which is now seen as one of the money-laundering capitals of the world.\nLabour called for the debate after the Guardian revealed that police in eastern Europe have been investigating how at least $20bn was moved out of Russia during a four-year period from 2010.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n \nThe Global Laundromat: where the money went\n\n\nDetectives have exposed a money-laundering scheme, called the “Global Laundromat”, that was run by Russian criminals with links to their government and the former KGB.\nDocuments seen by the Guardian show British-registered firms played a prominent role in the money laundering network – and the UK’s high street banks processed almost $740m from the operation without turning back any of the payments.\nHSBC processed $545.3m (£436.8m) in Laundromat cash, mostly routed through its Hong Kong branch. The troubled RBS, which is 71% owned by the UK government, handled $113.1m. Coutts, which is owned by RBS and used by the Queen, accepted $32.7m of payments via its office in Zurich, Switzerland.\nIn all, 17 banks based in the UK, or with branches in the country, are facing questions over what they knew about the transfers.\nSpeaking to the Guardian, the head of the NCA’s money laundering unit, David Little, said the amount of Russian money now coming into the UK is a concern because “we don’t know where it is coming from”.\n“We don’t have enough cooperation [from the Russian side] to establish that. They won’t tell us whether it comes from the proceeds of crime.”\nHe also said that UK banks needed to spend more money investigating criminal activity because sophisticated money launderers knew how to defeat their flagging systems.\nHis remarks were referred to by MPs during a half-hour debate in which Kirby, economic secretary to the Treasury, insisted the UK was doing more than any other country to tackle money laundering.\n\n\n\n\nHow 'dirty money' from Russia flooded into the UK – and where it went\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe minister said: “The Financial Conduct Authority and National Crime Agency take any such allegations seriously and will investigate closely whether recent information from the Guardian newspaper regarding money laundering from Russia ... would allow the progression of an investigation. Beyond that we need to make sure sophisticated criminal networks cannot exploit our financial services industry.”\nThe shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, called for an assurance from the government that “there will be the potential of opening up criminal proceedings to break up what is effectively a criminal network”.\nHe said the minister “does not seem to realise the immense gravity of the situation we are facing”.\nLabour former minister Ian Austin told MPs an estimated £100bn is laundered through London every year – but only 0.17% of that has been frozen by the authorities.\n“We might as well go from here, go to Heathrow and put up a welcome sign for Russian murderers and money launderers.”\nJames Berry, the Tory MP for Rossendale and Darwen, said the allegations “if proven, will be a national disgrace”.\nRobert Barrington, the executive director of Transparency International UK, said the Guardian’s revelations of the UK’s role in financial crime should “come as no surprise to anyone”.\n\n\n\n\nBritish banks handled vast sums of laundered Russian money\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“A year after the Panama Papers, we can see that the anti-money laundering supervisors have been asleep on the job, the banks have been at best lax and at worst complicit, and the UK’s law enforcement agencies have a dismal track record of investigations that lead to prosecutions.\n“Basically, the UK’s anti-money laundering defences are just not fit for purpose. The government needs a concerted, world-class strategy to deal with this if it’s going to convince people that we are not in a post-Brexit race to the bottom in which corrupt money is welcomed to the UK with open arms.”\nIn a statement, the FCA, said: “Clearly these are serious allegations and we will investigate any evidence that we receive.”\nThe NCA said it would “consider any formal request for assistance from the Moldovan authorities in connection with their investigation, and will consider whether information provided by the Guardian or other media sources would allow the progression of an investigation.”\nThe Guardian put detailed questions to all 17 UK based banks. The response from RBS was typical.\nIn a statement that also covered Coutts and NatWest, RBS said: “We are committed to combating financial crime and money laundering in line with our regulations and have controls and safeguards in place to identify, assess, monitor and mitigate these risks.”\n",

        "text": "\nJared Kushner, the son-in-law of Donald Trump, who acts as his senior White House adviser, secured a multimillion-dollar Manhattan real estate deal with a Soviet-born oligarch whose company was cited in a major New York money laundering case now being investigated by members of Congress.\n\n\n\n\nTrump not convinced Russian meddling took place, communications chief says\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Guardian investigation has established a series of overlapping ties and relationships involving alleged Russian money laundering, New York real estate deals and members of Trump’s inner circle. They include a 2015 sale of part of the old New York Times building in Manhattan involving Kushner and a billionaire real estate tycoon and diamond mogul, Lev Leviev.\nThe ties between Trump family real estate deals and Russian money interests are attracting growing interest from the justice department’s special counsel, Robert Mueller, as he seeks to determine whether the Trump campaign collaborated with Russia to distort the outcome of the 2016 race. Mueller has reportedly expanded his inquiry to look at real estate deals involving the Trump Organization, as well as Kushner’s financing.\nKushner will go before the US Senate intelligence committee on Monday in a closed session of the panel’s inquiry into Russian interference in the election in what could be a pivotal hearing into the affair. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n \nJared Kushner claims he ‘did not collude with Russia’\n\n\nLeviev, a global tycoon known as the “king of diamonds”, was a business partner of the Russian-owned company Prevezon Holdings that was at the center of a multimillion-dollar lawsuit launched in New York. Under the leadership of US attorney Preet Bharara, who was fired by Trump in March, prosecutors pursued Prevezon for allegedly attempting to use Manhattan real estate deals to launder money stolen from the Russian treasury.\nThe scam had been uncovered by Sergei Magnitsky, an accountant who died in 2009 in a Moscow jail in suspicious circumstances. US sanctions against Russia imposed after Magnitsky’s death were a central topic of conversation at the notorious Trump Tower meeting last June between Kushner, Donald Trump Jr, Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort and a Russian lawyer with ties to the Kremlin. \n\n\n Q&A What is the Magnitsky Act?  \n\n\n Show \n\n\n Hide  \n\n\nSergei Magnitsky was a Russian lawyer who investigated a massive $230m tax fraud in 2007. \nAfter he revealed the scam, Magnitsky was arrested by the same officials whom he had accused of covering up the racket and was imprisoned. He died in jail after being denied medical treatment. Russia accused him of committing the fraud himself and even put him on trial posthumously.\nAfter a long campaign by his associates, the Magnitsky Act was passed by Congress in 2012, banning entry to the US and freezing assets of officials believed to have been involved in Magnitsky's persecution and death. Russia responded by banning a list of US citizens it deemed hostile to Russia, and blocking the adoption of Russian children by US citizens – a controversial move that led critics to suggest the Kremlin was punishing Russia’s most vulnerable children. \n\n\n\n\nWas this helpful?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you for your feedback.\n\n\n\n\nDonald Jr and Manafort have been called to testify before the Senate judiciary committee on Wednesday, at which they are certain to face questions about the Trump Tower encounter.\nTwo days before it was due to open in court in May, the Prevezon case was settled for $6m with no admission of guilt on the part of the defendants. But since details of the Trump Tower meeting emerged, the abrupt settlement of the Prevezon case has come under renewed scrutiny from congressional investigators. \nFour Russians attended the meeting, led by Natalia Veselnitskaya, a lawyer with known Kremlin connections who acted as legal counsel for Prevezon in the money laundering case and who called the $6m settlement so slight that “it seemed almost an apology from the government”. Sixteen Democratic members of the House judiciary committee have now written to the justice department in light of the Trump Tower meeting demanding to know whether there was any interference behind the decision to avoid trial.\nConstitutional experts are also demanding an official inquiry. “We need a full accounting by Trump’s justice department of the unexplained and frankly outrageous settlement that is likely to be just the tip of a vast financial iceberg,” said Laurence Tribe, Harvard University professor of constitutional law. \nSeparately, the focus of investigators on Trump family finances stem from the vast flow of Russian wealth that has been poured into New York real estate in recent years. As Donald Trump Jr put it in 2008, referring to the Trump Organization: “We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia.”\nAmong the overlapping connections is the 2015 deal in which Kushner paid $295m to acquire several floors of the old New York Times building at 43rd street in Manhattan from the US branch of Leviev’s company, Africa Israel Investments (AFI), and its partner Five Mile Capital. The sale has been identified as of possible interest to the Mueller investigation as Kushner later went on to borrow $285m in refinancing from Deutsche Bank, the German financial house that itself has been embroiled in Russian money laundering scandals and whose loans to Trump are coming under intensifying scrutiny.\nCourt documents and company records show that AFI was cited in the Prevezon case as a business partner of the defendants. In 2008, Prevezon entered a partnership with AFI in which Prevezon bought for €3m, a 30% stake in four AFI subsidiaries in the Netherlands. Five years later, AFI tried to return the money to the Russian-owned company, but it was intercepted and frozen by Dutch authorities at the request of the US government as part of the Prevezon money-laundering investigation.\nIn Manhattan, Leviev’s firm also sold condominiums to Prevezon Holdings from one of its landmark developments at 20 Pine Street, just a few blocks from Wall Street.\nReal estate brochures describe the lavish interior decor of the condominiums, replete with bathrooms bedecked in stone and exotic woods, and boasting “the ultimate in pampering; a sybaritic recessed rain shower”. The 20 Pine Street apartments that Leviev sold to Prevezon were later frozen by US prosecutors seeking to block the flow of what they alleged to be money stolen from the Russian treasury and laundered through New York real estate.\nPrevezon’s 20 Pine Street apartments and €3m in assets were all released as part of the settlement in May.\nThe Guardian contacted both Kushner and Leviev for comment, but they did not immediately respond.\nThe pursuit of Prevezon Holdings for alleged money laundering took on enormous political significance as it unfolded. For the prosecutors, it was a test case over suspicious Russian money flows designed to show the US was serious about going after money launderers. For the Russians, it was an opportunity to push back against stringent US sanctions that had long infuriated the Kremlin.\nIn court documents, US prosecutors accused Prevezon and its sole shareholder, Denis Katsyv, of participating in the laundering of proceeds of the vast tax fraud that stole $230m from the Russian treasury and moved it out of the country in chunks. Prevezon was alleged to have received some of the fraudulent spoils through a network of shell companies, hiding the money by investing in Manhattan real estate including the Leviev condominiums in 20 Pine Street.\nPrevezon and Katsyv have consistently denied any involvement in money laundering and have dismissed the lawsuit as “ill-conceived”. In a statement released at the time of the settlement, they said they had “no involvement in or knowledge of any fraudulent activities”.\nMagnitsky discovered the massive tax fraud, said to be one of the largest in Vladimir Putin’s Russia, in 2007. After he blew the whistle on the scam, he was arrested by the same officials whom he had accused of covering up the racket and imprisoned, dying in jail having been denied medical treatment.\nMagnitsky’s death led to a political backlash in the US that in turn spawned tough sanctions on Russia, known as the Magnitsky Act. Russian individuals associated with the lawyer’s demise and other human rights abuses were banned entry to the US.\n\n\n\n\nRussian man at Trump Jr meeting had partner with Soviet intelligence ties\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVeselnitskaya not only acted as Prevezon’s Russian counsel in the money-laundering case, she also was a leading lobbyist against the Magnitsky sanctions. She raised the subject prominently at the meeting in Trump Tower with Don Jr and Kushner, though according to Veselnitskaya the president’s son-in-law left after 10 minutes.\nBy the time of the Trump Tower meeting, Veselnitskaya was already personally acquainted with Russia’s powerful prosecutor general, Yuri Chaika, and her lobbying against the Magnitsky sanctions had drawn significant attention in government circles.\n“Natalia’s main role was coordinating, including regular coordination with Chaika, whom she knew personally,” said a source acquainted with the Prevezon case. \nVeselnitskaya told the Guardian: “My meeting with Trump’s son was a private meeting; nobody in the government had anything to do with it.” She declined to answer a follow-up question about whether and how she knew Chaika.\nJamison Firestone, the founder of the Russian law firm that employed Magnitsky at the time that he exposed the fraud, said that Veselnitskaya clearly intended to use the Trump Tower meeting to lobby against the Magnitsky sanctions. “They really made it a state priority to get rid of these sanctions,” he said.\nSign up for Guardian US Today to receive the day’s top US stories every morning \n\n\n\n",

        "text": "\nHSBC has avoided the threat of prosecution in the US over allegations that its lax controls allowed Mexican drug traffickers to launder cash through the bank.\nThe risk of a prosecution has been hanging over Britain’s biggest bank for the past five years after it was forced to pay $1.9bn (£1.4bn) to the US authorities to settle claims it allowed “narcotics traffickers and others to launder hundreds of millions of dollars through HSBC subsidiaries and to facilitate hundreds of millions more in transactions with sanctioned countries”. \nFive years to the day that the settlement was announced, HSBC said the US Department of Justice would file a motion in the district court in the eastern district of New York to dismiss the deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) that had been imposed on the bank at the time.\nThe bank said it had “lived up to all of its commitments”under the DPA and was pleased that the DoJ had recognised its progress in strengthening its compliance with anti-money laundering rules and sanctions rules.\nThe lifting of the DPA is a relief for the bank, its former chairman Douglas Flint and its outgoing chief executive, Stuart Gulliver. Under Gulliver HSBC has spent $1bn on efforts to clean up its business and bolster its compliance operations. Its shares rose almost 2% to 746p on Monday.\nUnder the DPA, the DoJ installed a monitor, American lawyer Michael Cherkasky, in the bank’s operations and he will remain in place until July 2018, exactly five years after he began his oversight of the bank’s operations.\nAt the same time the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority appointed Cherkasky in a similar role on its behalf and HSBC said he would “continue in that capacity for a period of time at the FCA’s discretion”.\nWhen the DPA was announced, the US had described it as “sword of Damocles” hanging over HSBC. According to a report by the US Congress, the bank avoided criminal charges at the time because the then chancellor, George Osborne, had warned it could lead to a financial disaster if the bank lost its licence to operate in the US.\nGulliver – who is leaving HSBC in February after nearly four decades – said the bank was now able to combat financial crime more effectively than five years ago. \n“We are committed to doing our part to protect the integrity of the global financial system, and further improvements to our own capability and contributions toward the partnerships we have established with governments in this area will remain a top priority for the Bank into 2018 and beyond,” said Gulliver, who is being replaced by insider John Flint.\nThe monitor’s role has been mentioned in HSBC’s annual reports – which spell out any risks facing the bank – and in February it admitted he had raised concerns that had sparked an FCA investigation into to potential breaches of money laundering rules.\nIn recent months, the Guardian reported that the monitor had also been informed about alleged ties between the wealthy Gupta family and the South African president, Jacob Zuma. Concerns were raised by former Labour cabinet minister Peter Hain, and HSBC said it had closed bank accounts held by “front companies” associated with the Guptas.\nHSBC was subject to further scrutiny of its activities after the Guardian and other publications revealed in 2015 that the bank’s Swiss operations had helped wealthy customers dodge taxes and conceal millions of dollars of assets. This followed the leak of documents of 30,000 accounts that covering the period 2005-07.\nRival bank Standard Chartered was subject to a DPA at the same time as HSBC and last month admitted it was being extended for a second time to July 2018.\n Ian Gordon, an analyst at financial firm Investec, said: “It is clearly a relief that the DPA has not been extended in contrast to Standard Chartered. It will also potentially lead to an annual monitor-related cost saving of £200m but not yet as the D0J monitor remains in place until July 2018 … and this could be extended by the FCA.”\n•Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.\n",

        "text": "\nJames Packer’s Crown Resorts is facing investigations by federal money laundering authorities and casino regulators in at least two states after Wednesday’s explosive allegations of tampering with poker machines and avoiding reporting of cash transactions at Crown’s Melbourne casino.\nAnti-gambling campaigner and MP Andrew Wilkie tabled a video in federal parliament containing the serious allegations made by three former Crown employees. \nHe said he had verified their identities. One appeared to be a poker machine technician, while one other was a gaming room attendant.\n They included allegations that Crown:\n\nmanipulated machines to change the odds\ninstructed staff to modify buttons on the machines so they could be wedged with small picks, thereby allowing people to gamble automatically in breach of state regulations \nallowed other people’s identity cards to be used to process cash transactions\n\nCrown has rejected the allegations of illegal or improper conduct, but has so far only made a brief statement to the Australian stock exchange.\n\n\n\n\nThe poker machine-tampering allegations against Crown in full\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA spokeswoman for Austrac, the federal authority responsible for monitoring cash transactions over $10,000, said it was investigating and regarded the allegations as serious.\nOne whistleblower in the video claimed he had witnessed other people’s identity documents being used to process transactions of gamblers who had issues with being identified to Austrac.\nCasinos are high-risk venues for washing the proceeds of crime and authorities rely on management to assist them in identifying suspicious transactions. Compliance is also part of their licence conditions.\nThe Victorian Commission for Gambling and Liquor Regulation, which has oversight of Crown Melbourne and is currently undertaking the five-year review of the Victorian licence, said it would be investigating immediately.\n“We take any claims of this type extremely seriously and they will be thoroughly investigated,” a spokeswoman said. “We continue to work closely with other law enforcement agencies, including Austrac and Victoria police, to ensure the purposes of the Casino Control Act 1991 are met.”\nBut the whistleblowers also accused the commission of being complicit in the breaches, saying it did not make the sort of inquiries needed to uncover the tampering they allege happened.\nThe commission said it had taken active steps over the past 12 months to improve its level of supervision of the casino. This included establishing a specialist dedicated casino team.\n Crown is also facing issues with regulators in New South Wales, where it has been granted a licence for a high-rollers casino to be built at Barangaroo. In Western Australia it has the Crown Burswood casino.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Independent MP Andrew Wilkie wants the Senate to set up a parliamentary inquiry. Photograph: Mick Tsikas/AAP\n\n\nMost casino licences require the operator to be fit and proper and so a breach of the Melbourne licence would have ramifications for other states.\nThe NSW Independent Liquor and Gaming Authority (ILGA) and Liquor and Gaming NSW said they were closely monitoring these allegations against Crown’s Melbourne casino. \n“ILGA has ongoing responsibility to consider whether casino operators in NSW and their associates are suitable to hold a licence. Where appropriate, ILGA can issue directions and undertake disciplinary action,” a spokesman said.\n“ Liquor & Gaming NSW is also engaging with Crown and its Victorian regulator counterpart in relation to the allegations.”\n\n\n\n\n'A pretty crappy bet': the pokies that rely on deception and addiction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The whistleblowers’ identities were heavily disguised and Wilkie – himself a whistleblower some years ago – said it was up to the individuals to decide whether to go to federal and state authorities.\n“ I have had several conversations with them,” Wilkie said. “They are so nervous about what they are doing and I will not reveal their identities to anyone. “ I am not going to encourage them to, but it’s up to these three men or any other people who have worked at the casino to go to the authorities.”\n Wilkie wants the Senate to set up a parliamentary inquiry so that whistleblowers have the protection of parliamentary privilege when giving evidence.\nCrown shares fell by 6% on Wednesday from $11.76 before recovering slightly. But they were down a further 1% on Thursday at $11.08 at mid-morning.\nCrown has been contacted for comment.\n",

        "title": "Erdoğan knew of alleged Iranian scheme to evade sanctions via Turkey, court told",
        "date": "2017-11-30T13:28:35Z",
        "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/30/us-court-alleged-iran-scheme-avoid-sanctions-turkey",
        "text": "\nA scheme Iran allegedly used to evade sanctions through a state-owned bank in Turkey has been detailed in court by a businessman who claimed the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, had been aware of the billion-dollar operation.\nIn a case that has strained relations between Turkey and the US, Reza Zarrab, a Turkish-Iranian gold trader, described a sprawling money laundering network that allowed Iran access to international markets from 2010 to 2015 in violation of sanctions over its nuclear programme.\nHe told jurors in New York on Thursday that Erdoğan, who was prime minister of Turkey at the time, had personally authorised a transaction on behalf of Iran. Zarrab said he had bribed the then Turkish economy minister Zafer Çağlayan and the former head of the state-owned Halkbank.\nZarrab had faced charges including bank fraud and money laundering, but court papers revealed on Tuesday that he struck a deal last month with prosecutors to plead guilty and testify against his former co-defendant in the case, Mehmet Hakan Atilla, a former deputy chief of Halkbank.\nThe Turkish government had repeatedly raised Zarrab’s case with the US, demanding his release before the plea deal was made public. Senior Turkish officials have in recent weeks condemned the trial as a plot engineered by Fethullah Gülen, a Pennsylvania-based cleric accused by the government of orchestrating an attempted coup last year.\nIn its first reaction to Zarrab’s testimony, Bekir Bozdağ, the Turkish deputy prime minister, described the trial as “theatre” and a “plot against Turkey and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan”, adding that justice could not be expected.\nErdoğan was quoted by CNN Türk on Thursday as saying Turkey did not violate US sanctions against Iran and “did the right thing”.\nIn Turkey, the trial has been dismissed by senior officials and pro-government media as a conspiracy based on evidence gathered illegally by members of Gülen’s movement in the police and judiciary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Front pages of Turkish newspapers on Thursday with headlines concerning the trial in New York. Photograph: Burhan Ozbilici/AP\n\n\nWhen asked about the possibility that the trial could implicate Ankara in the violation of sanctions, the Turkish foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, said: “Why should I be concerned?\n“If something is fabricated, we also have something to say. This is an indictment prepared by [Gülen’s] people … it means that the case is very much politically motivated.”\nDespite the public dismissals, the case is likely to prove embarrassing for Erdoğan’s government if prosecutors provide compelling evidence linking Zarrab to other senior officials. It could also have a damaging effect on the Turkish economy if his revelations hurt the banking system at a time when the Turkish lira’s value is falling.\nRelations between the US and Turkey, the two largest armies in Nato, have been greatly strained over the past few years, beginning with the former’s reluctance to intervene forcefully against Bashar al-Assad early in the Syrian civil war. Recent US support for Kurdish militias fighting Islamic State in Syria has further angered Ankara, which considers them affiliates of the Kurdish insurgency in Turkey.\nVisa services for nationals of both countries have been suspended in recent weeks over the arrest of US consulate personnel in Turkey accused of having links to the Gülen network.\nÇağlayan resigned in late 2013 over corruption claims. The Erdoğan government alleges that the investigation against him that year was orchestrated by the Gülen movement, and it marked the total break in ties between that organisation and the ruling Justice and Development party.\nOn Thursday, the pro-government newspaper Daily Sabah published a rebuttal with the headline: “Fabricated evidence, a pro-[Gülen] judge, a clear plot against Turkey: all about the Zarrab case.” \nIt accused the judge overseeing the caseand the former prosecutor who indicted Zarrab of having links to the Gülen movement.\nAtilla has pleaded not guilty. His lawyer, Victor Rocco, told jurors in an opening statement that Zarrab was “a liar, a cheat … a one-man crime wave”, while his client, by contrast, was not corrupt and took no bribes. \nHalkbank issued a statement on Thursday insisting that it “strictly adheres to national and international regulations” in all businesses and transactions. \n“Foreign trade transactions and money transfers are conducted in an open, transparent manner and can be monitored by the relevant authorities,” it said.\nZarrab was arrested in March 2016 when he flew to Florida with his wife, the Turkish singer Ebru Gündeş, and his daughter, for a trip to Disney World. \n",

        "text": "\nVictims of international money-laundering schemes are being targeted by Australian police in a bid to seize their funds, in a strategy that could have a “disastrous impact” on victims, a former officer has warned.\n“Cuckoo smurfing” schemes launder money by duping innocent parties into being account holders for a series of seemingly legitimate financial transactions known as “structured deposits”.\nThe schemes have often targeted migrants from south-east Asian countries who seek to establish a bank account in Australia.\nAustralian federal police, who took over proceeds of crime cases from the commonwealth director of public prosecutions several years ago, use restraining orders under the Proceeds of Crime Act to freeze funds and recover them. But they are increasingly targeting funds from innocent parties of smurfing operations.\nFormer AFP officer Chris Douglas, who was heavily involved in financial crime and money-laundering operations until he retired in 2013, told Guardian Australia the agency’s approach was “completely flawed”. \n“Ongoing AFP action could have a significant impact, if not a disastrous impact, on other victims and upon Australia, particularly if any of the funds that have been involved in a cuckoo smurfing scheme are held by a migration agent, education provider or Australian exporter,” he said.\nThe AFP’s approach was thwarted last week in a Western Australian supreme court case involving Malaysian couple Ganesh Kalimuthu and Macquelene Patricia Michael Dass, who had $3m seized after falling victim to a laundering scheme.\nJustice Jeremy Allanson found that the couple’s position “is relevantly no different from that of a person who sells property to a stranger and is paid by direct debit into his bank account”. He struck out the AFP’s freezing order on the basis that the couple were a “third party”, not linked to the criminal action.\n“It is not alleged that either respondent was party to any offence in Australia, or knew that the property was the proceeds or the instrument of an offence,” Allanson ruled.\nDouglas said the AFP’s pursuit of the couple showed that government needed to review the agency’s role in forfeiture cases.\n“By targeting Kalimuthu and Dass, the AFP has gone after what it perceives as being low-hanging fruit, using the very powerful civil forfeiture provisions ... That act was never intended to be used against innocent victims of crime,” he said.\nThe AFP is now seeking to delay other cases it believes it is likely to lose if the Western Australian decision is upheld.\nIn a hearing at the NSW supreme court in Sydney on Thursday, the AFP sought an urgent order to vacate an upcoming hearing relating to an Indonesian couple who were the victims of a similar laundering scheme. In that case $6m of their assets were frozen, even though only $3m was believed to be laundered money.\nAs in the West Australian decision, no evidence was offered that the couple were aware of the laundering scheme.\nDuring the course of the hearings the AFP commissioner’s counsel disclosed there were at least 16 cases before the courts or awaiting judgment that involved circumstances similar to the West Australian decision. \nHe sought an order to vacate the hearing until the commissioner, Andrew Colvin, could lodge an appeal against the WA decision, likely to take place next week.\n“It is the commissioner’s position that it is in the public interest ... to have an appellate ruling on this issue,” the counsel said. “It would be a false economy for the parties to go ahead with the matter.”\nThe barrister for the Indonesian couple, Travis Mitchell, told the court that if the AFP’s application to vacate the hearing was accepted it would effectively allow the Proceeds of Crime Act to be “used as a tool of oppression”.\n‘The stay application benefits the commissioner only ... my clients have $6m of their money restrained,” he said.\nHe said it was a “false hope” that the Western Australian case would resolve everything, because that decision was not necessarily binding on other state courts.\nOn Friday Justice Lucy McCallum rejected the AFP’s bid to delay the hearing.\nThe AFP declined to comment on it’s approach to cuckoo smurfing cases but confirmed it would appeal against the West Australian decision \n“The AFP shortly intends to seek to appeal this judgment,” a spokeswoman said.\nContact Paul Farrell securely using the Signal messaging app on +61 457 262 172 or using the Guardian’s Securedrop server\n",

        "text": "\nGood morning, this is Mike Ticher, standing in for Eleanor Ainge Roy, bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Tuesday 31 October.\nTop stories\nThe special counsel investigation into the Trump campaign’s links to Moscow has unveiled its first charges, alleging collusion with Kremlin-linked Russians, money laundering and conspiracy to defraud the US government involving three of the president’s former aides. George Papadopolous, a former foreign policy adviser, has pleaded guilty to lying to FBI investigators over his contacts last year with an unnamed Russian professor who offered “dirt” on Hillary Clinton – and with a woman the professor identified as “Putin’s niece”. \nThe special counsel, Robert Mueller, has also charged Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort, and another senior campaign operative, Rick Gates, with money laundering, tax evasion and failing to register as agents of foreign interests. Manafort is accused of illegally lobbying on behalf of former Ukrainian president Victor Yanukovych and using hidden offshore cash to buy properties, one of which he rented on Airbnb. Conservatives have questioned Mueller’s fitness to investigate and Donald Trump has tried to play down the significance of the findings. But the story could not be bigger, and the stakes could not be higher, writes Tom McCarthy. \nTensions are high on Manus Island, where detainees have launched legal action over the closure of Australia’s immigration detention centre, saying their human rights are being breached by the removal of basic services such as water and electricity. The centre is due to close today, but there is no clear plan for what will happen to more than 600 refugees and asylum seekers. Authorities face a potential standoff with detainees who refuse to leave, as well as locals reportedly blocking the construction of new refugee accommodation. The Papua New Guinea government has warned Australia it will take no responsibility for “non-refugees” and people who refuse to settle in PNG. Behrouz Boochani, an Iranian refugee and journalist on Manus, writes about the terrible conditions in the centre.\nThe concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increased at record speed last year to hit a level not seen for more than three million years, the UN weather agency has warned. Its report found globally averaged concentrations of CO2 reached 403.3 parts per million in 2016, up from 400.00 ppm in 2015 because of a combination of human activities and a strong El Niño, raising alarm among scientists. The acceleration occurred despite a slowdown in emissions, because El Niño intensified droughts and weakened the ability of vegetation to absorb carbon dioxide. \nMore than half of Australians believe the national broadband network will fail to meet the country’s future internet needs, and almost 40% blame the Turnbull government for problems with the network, the latest Guardian Essential poll has found. The survey found 39% believed the Turnbull government was to blame for the current problems with the NBN, while just 19% laid the blame with Labor. That’s more bad news for the government after it dropped to 46% to Labor’s 54% on the two-party-preferred measure, a two-point drop from the last poll. \nKevin Spacey is under fire for linking his sexuality to an apology about allegations of sexual advances towards a 14-year-old actor. The House Of Cards star said he could not remember sexually harassing Star Trek actor Anthony Rapp in 1986. The LGBT lobby group Stonewall said conflating Spacey’s sexual orientation and the serious allegations he faces was “extremely damaging”. The Guardian’s Owen Jones says Spacey has “fuelled a vicious lie about gay men”. \nSport\nWith the addition of Cooper Cronk to their squad, the Sydney Roosters have found the final piece of their puzzle, the type of leader and organiser they have been longing for, says Nick Tedeschi. It may force Mitchell Pearce out of the club, but that is a price the Roosters are prepared to pay – it means the rugby league premiership is theirs to lose.\nThe next rugby World Cup may be two years away, but the Wallabies already need to be thinking about how to manage the workload of their players, writes Bret Harris. The intense physical demands on a player like Michael Hooper put him in the high-risk category to suffer a serious injury. Coach Michael Cheika needs to force him and others need to rest at times.\nThinking time\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Richard Flanagan has warned of the dangers of losing our private lives to the tech giants. Photograph: Joel Saget/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\nThe Booker Prize-winning author Richard Flanagan has been occupied with notions of truth, alternative facts and privacy since writing his latest book, First Person. What is the difference between truth and reality? What do we give up when we hand over our private information to the behemoths of social media? In this essay Flanagan warns that anyone wanting to gain control over us always first seeks to know everything about our lives, and the erasure of privacy has long been the goal of totalitarian regimes. \nAustralian workers face more weak wages growth, despite improved employment, and the interest rate rises the market keeps predicting won’t happen for quite a while, Greg Jericho argues. “One of the oddest things about Australian economics is the market’s continuing desire to believe inflation growth is going to come sooner rather than later and that, as a result, interest rates will also begin to rise. And yet time and time again, the inflation figures disappoint them.” \nMany of Rosamund Young’s insight about cows sound like the thoughts of a sentimental and slightly batty English eccentric. Each of her 113 cows has a name. She credits them with strong emotions, analyses their sophisticated family networks and believes they are “the most qualified individuals to make decisions about their own welfare”. But Young, the modestly celebrated author of The Secret Life of Cows, still drives most of her cows to the abattoir once they reach two. “I went through a phase of finding it incredibly difficult,” she says. “I’m OK about it now.”\nWhat’s he done now?\nDonald Trump had a lot of question marks over the sensational developments in the Mueller investigation, tweeting: “Sorry, but this is years ago, before Paul Manafort was part of the Trump campaign. But why aren’t Crooked Hillary & the Dems the focus?????” Apparently as an afterthought, he added: “....Also, there is NO COLLUSION!”\nMedia roundup\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Daily Telegraph splashes on a row between Malcolm Turnbull and Warren Mundine, saying the Indigenous leader has savaged the PM’s efforts on Indigenous affairs as pandering to “inner city elites and ABC lefties”. \nThe Herald Sun hails the 21,400 dobbers who helped recover $40m in public funds last year, proudly noting that Victorians are “grassing up their neighbours over welfare fraud and dole bludging at a greater rate than ever before”. \nAnd the ABC says three Coalition MPs – Warren Entsch, George Christensen and Ann Sudmalis – are threatening to cross the floor to vote to establish a banking royal commission.\nComing up\nMalcolm Turnbull and Bill Shorten are among the politicians representing Australia in Israel for the commemoration of the centenary of the battle of Beersheba and the charge of the Australian Light Horse Brigade. Paul Daley has tried to disentangle the myth from reality of those contested events.\nA damages hearing is scheduled in Sydney after the West Indies cricketer Chris Gayle won his defamation lawsuit against Fairfax Media on Monday. \nSupporting the Guardian\nWe’d like to acknowledge our generous supporters who enable us to keep reporting on the critical stories.

        "title": "Bank that lent $300m to Trump linked to Russian money laundering scam",
        "date": "2017-03-21T19:00:14Z",
        "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/21/deutsche-bank-that-lent-300m-to-trump-linked-to-russian-money-laundering-scam",
        "text": "\nThe German bank that loaned $300m (£260m) to Donald Trump played a prominent role in a money laundering scandal run by Russian criminals with ties to the Kremlin, the Guardian can reveal.\nDeutsche Bank is one of dozens of western financial institutions that processed at least $20bn – and possibly more – in money of “criminal origin” from Russia.\nThe scheme, dubbed “the Global Laundromat”, ran from 2010 to 2014. \nLaw enforcement agencies are investigating how a group of politically well-connected Russians were able to use UK-registered companies to launder billions of dollars in cash. The companies made fictitious loans to each other, underwritten by Russian businesses.\nThe companies would default on these “debts”. Judges in Moldova then made court rulings enforcing judgments against the firms. This allowed Russian bank accounts to transfer huge sums to Moldova legally. From there, the money went to accounts in Latvia with Trasta Komercbanka.\nDeutsche, Germany’s biggest lender, acted as a “correspondent bank” for Trasta until 2015. This meant Deutsche provided dollar-denominated services to Trasta’s non-resident Russian clients. This service was used to move money from Latvia to banks across the world.\nDuring this period many Wall Street banks got out of Latvia, citing concerns that the small Baltic country had become a centre for international money laundering, especially from neighbouring Russia. \nIn 2013, and under US regulatory pressure, JP Morgan Chase ceased providing dollar clearing services to the country.\nFrom 2014, only two western lenders were willing to accept international dollar transfers from Latvian banks. They were Deutsche and Germany’s Commerzbank. Deutsche eventually withdrew correspondent services to Trasta Bank in September 2015. \nSix months later, Latvian regulators shut down the bank. They cited repeated violations, and said the bank had failed to deal with its money laundering risk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n \nThe Global Laundromat: where the money went\n\n\nLatvia’s deputy finance minister, Maija Treija, said the money sent via Trasta was “either stolen or with criminal origin”. \nThe defunct bank was being used as vehicle to get money out of the ex-Soviet Union and “into the EU financial system”, she added.\nDeutsche said it had significantly strengthened its systems and controls. It said that by the end of this year it will have hired more than 1,000 new staff in its compliance and anti-financial crime unit since 2015. \nIt added: “The bank has comprehensively reviewed its client onboarding and know-your-client processes and where necessary is exiting higher risk client relationships and markets.”\nCommerzbank said it could not comment on its relationships with other banks. It said it put a high value on compliance. It said that suspicious transactions picked up during routine monitoring were reported to the authorities.\nDeutche Bank ended its relationship with Trasta soon after Latvia’s regulator issued a warning, it is understood. In August 2015, the Financial and Capital Markets Commission stopped all transactions above €100,000. \nDeutsche severed its relationship with the other key Laundromat bank - Moldova’s Moldindconbank – in 2012.\nTies with Russia are a matter of acute sensitivity for Deutsche. In February, it emerged that Deutsche had secretly reviewed multiple loans made to President Trump by its private wealth division to see if there was a connection to Russia. Trump owes Deutsche about $300m. \nDeutsche refused to comment on its internal review. Sources say the bank discovered no evidence of any Moscow link. That covers other members of the US president’s family who are also Deutsche clients. They include Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, her husband, Jared Kushner, and Kushner’s mother, Seryl Stadtmauer. \nIn January, the UK and US imposed record $630m fines on Deutsche for its role in another money laundering scam run out of its Moscow office. The bank failed to prevent $10bn of Russian money being laundered in a complex “mirror trades” operation. The wealthy Russians that used the scheme have not been identified.\nDeutsche’s Private Bank – the division that lends to Trump – appears in the Global Laundromat scheme. Sources suggest that many of its clients are rich Russians, typically with personal assets of $50m-plus. According to Germany’s Süddeutsche Zeitung, Deutsche processed more than $24m of Laundromat cash in 209 transactions.\nRecords obtained by the Organized Crime and Corruption Project (OCCRP) and Novaya Gazeta from anonymous sources show how the money was spent. Much of it vanished into opaque offshore companies. Some of it went on luxury items including diamonds, leather jackets, and home-cinema equipment.\nOne of Deutsche’s high net worth customers blew €500,000 at Mahlberg, a German jewellery firm. The payment in January 2013 was made by Seabon Limited, a Laundromat company registered in Tooley Street, London. More than $9bn was funnelled via Seabon, records show. \nAlmost €1m went to a Munich electronics firm, Rohde & Schwarz, which produces surveillance technology for security services and police.\nOften, the explanation for high-volume payments was fake. The money spent on watches was marked down on the bank wire transfer as a payment for “computer equipment”.\nAnother $500,000 payment was made to a London fur broker, Gideon Bartfeld. Bartfeld said the money had arrived from Deutsche Bank New York, before being sent on to the Bank of New York Mellon, which paid the invoice. Trasta – the bank that first sent the money to Deutsche – did not appear in any paperwork, he added.\nBartfeld said the payment came via two “highly reputable and respected” global banks. He said: “Consequently, we received this payment in full confidence [as they] were satisfied that the payment met their rigorous due diligence and compliance requirements.” \nThe fur trader said he had known many of his Russian clients for years. His main markets were Russia and China, he added. There is no suggestion that Bartfeld or Mahlberg or Rohde & Schwarz were involved in wrongdoing.\n",

        "text": "\nOne of the world’s largest publicly listed gaming companies has been fined $45m for breaching money-laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws, in one of the biggest civil penalties handed down in corporate Australia.\nThe Australian Transactions Reports and Analysis Centre brought a federal court case against Tabcorp Holdings, Tab Limited and Tabcorp Wagering (Vic) Pty Ltd in 2016, alleging violations of money-laundering laws. \nThe Austrac chief executive, Paul Jevtovic, welcomed the decision: “In our view, Tabcorp had a corporate culture indifferent to meaningful AML/CTF [anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing act] compliance and risk-mitigation until we intervened.\n\n\n\n\nAnti-money laundering body Austrac to begin legal proceedings against Tabcorp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“[Companies] across all industries should take note to ensure that they are fully informed of their AML/CTF compliance.\n“Such contraventions are not to be taken lightly and this unprecedented civil penalty highlights Austrac’s resolve to take enforcement action against reporting entities that engage in significant, extensive and systemic non-compliance.”\nUnder money-laundering and counter-terrorism laws, some entities are required to disclose information to Austrac as part of what is known as “suspicious matter reports.”\nOn Thursday Justice Perram ruled that Tab Limited had engaged in a series of breaches, including:\n\nFailing to provide a report to Austrac over suspected match-fixing in August 2010.\n\n\nFailing to provide reports on time to Austrac in 32 cases of suspected credit betting between 2010 and 2013.\n\n\nFailing to provide reports to Austrac on time for 51 Tab accounts who were suspected to have engaged in credit card fraud.\n\nThe judge also found that Tabcorp Holdings Limited had failed to lodge suspicious matter reports within required timeframes in 20 instances of suspected credit betting and that Tabcorp Wagering (Vic) Pty Ltd engaged in one failure to lodge a report within the required timeframe.\nPerram ruled that the respondents must “pay to the commonwealth of Australia a pecuniary penalty in the total sum of AUD$45m within 28 days of the date of this order”.\nHe also ordered the companies pay Austrac’s costs.\nPerram reserved the publication of reasons for his decision to a later date.\n",

        "text": "\nThe Commonwealth Bank’s chief executive, Ian Narev, will step aside by 1 July 2018, the bank’s chairman, Catherine Livingstone, has announced.\nLivingstone declined to say if Narev had offered to resign, only saying the announcement should provide certainty to the market.\nThe bank’s annual report, released on Monday, shows Narev’s total remuneration was $5.5m for the year to 30 June, down from $12.3m a year earlier – representing a 55% pay cut.\nIf he had realised all of his incentives and bonuses in the last year, he would have made $2.8m more.\nTwo weeks ago the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre launched civil proceedings against CBA in the federal court, claiming the bank had made “serious and systemic” violations of laws aimed at combating funding of terrorism and crime syndicates.\nThe Australian Securities and Investments Commission is also investigating whether CBA broke disclosure laws by not telling investors about possible money laundering by criminal gangs and suspected terrorists.\n\n\n\n\nCommonwealth Bank unmasked: why the government is suing over alleged terrorism trail – explainer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLivingstone said the exact timing of Narev’s departure would depend on the outcome of the bank’s search for a replacement. \n“Succession planning is an ongoing process at all levels of the bank,” she said. “In discussions with Ian we have also agreed it is important for the business that we deal with the speculation and questions about his tenure.\n“Today’s statement provides that clarity and will ensure he can continue to focus, as CEO, on successfully managing the business.”\nThe CBA board has been trying desperately to limit the fallout from the money laundering allegations.\nLast week it axed senior executive bonuses in response to the scandal ahead of its annual results presentation. \nThe bank beat analyst expectations with a full-year cash profit of $9.88bn – a 4.6% improvement on 2016, representing an eighth straight record for Australia’s largest bank.\nThe bank is also facing a lawsuit from shareholders for what they say is a failure to properly disclose the risks of climate change posed to the business.\nThe Reserve Bank governor, Philip Lowe, lashed out at the bank last week, saying people must be held accountable if laws had been broken.\nAsked on Monday if Narev had offered to resign, Livingstone said only: “The board has full confidence in Ian and in the executive team.”\nCommonwealth executives last year pocketed $16m in short-term bonuses despite a landmark shareholder rejection of its remuneration plans under Australia’s “two strikes” laws.\n",

        "text": "\nThe Commonwealth Bank chief executive, Ian Narev, has said he was “reasonably confident” that early internal warnings around a money laundering scandal that has enveloped the bank were not “wilfully ignored”.\nNarev also cited a “very constructive” relationship with law enforcement agencies, despite the bank facing a landmark lawsuit alleging systemic violations of money laundering laws that culminated in an Australian federal police raid.\nHe told journalists he accepted the scandal and the prospect of costly civil proceedings by Austrac had “overshadowed” the bank’s delivery of its eighth consecutive record annual cash profit of $9.88bn on Wednesday.\n\n\n\n\nCommonwealth Bank CEO to be forced to appear at bank hearings following scandal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile noting the case had drawn “a very high degree of scrutiny that has not reflected well on the bank [or] me personally”, Narev declined to say whether he thought his job was at risk despite continued backing of the bank’s board.\nHe also declined to say whether sackings had taken place in senior ranks since problems with delayed or non-existent reporting of suspicious transactions, including by five customers allegedly earmarked by the bank as potential terrorists or terrorism funders. \nNarev defended the bank’s lack of disclosure of the problems around criminals allegedly exploiting its “intelligent deposit machines” (IDMs) in 2015, saying the bank could not have known Austrac would seek costly penalties until the agency sued it last week.\nAustrac alleges more than 53,700 breaches of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act since 2012, each bringing a maximum fine of $18m.\nAn under pressure Narev, who has been stripped of multimillion-dollar bonuses over the scandal, was upbeat when earlier delivering a net cash profit result to analysts that bettered their expectations, rising 4.6% last financial year.\nNarev hailed the bank’s performance as contributing “to the financial wellbeing of our customers, shareholders, our people and the Australian economy”.\nThe Australian Council of Trade Unions said it was an “eye-watering profit” that showcased the power of large corporations and banks’ role in rising inequality amid growing mortgage and credit card debt.\nThe consumer advocacy group Choice said it showed “real problems with competition in the banking sector” with the commonwealth’s consumer finance revenue of almost $2bn including “a motza from fees and interest on credit cards”.\nWhen an analyst raised Austrac’s lawsuit with Narev, the bank boss declined to confirm its late reporting of suspect transactions included customers it assessed as a risk of possible involvement in terrorism or terrorism funding.\nHe also declined to confirm Austrac’s claim the alleged violations sprang partly from the bank’s policy of not reporting suspicious transactions if similar reports were made in the three months beforehand.\nNarev said the bank had “made mistakes” but his understanding was the lawsuit did not allege bad intent, “there’s no ulterior motive, there’s no profit motive”.\n“It’s a really important distinction,” he said. “Now, we’ve got to play our part in working with Austrac, we have a very constructive relationship with them and with the [Australian federal police] and others in doing everything we can to perform our role in helping them doing what they’re doing.”\nThe lawsuit alleges repeated delays by the bank in responding to requests for information from the Australian federal police, which in one case led to a raid on its premises to seize account documents relating to a $315m methamphetamine bust in Perth. \nIn some cases, the bank simply ignored alerts from law enforcement of “unlawful activity”, Austrac says.\n“Is everything perfect? Absolutely not,” Narev told analysts. “But we’ll keep looking at policies and processes and see within the very significant amount of work we’re already doing if there’s still more that needs to be done, it’ll get done and no stone will be left unturned to look at that.”\nAsked during a media briefing about the challenges of restoring the bank’s reputation in the face of allegations it had been “helping terrorists”, Narev said: “I have no evidence that we were assisting with any terrorist funding.\n“The questions are very clearly related to a specific group of crime gangs.”\nNarev said the full scale of most of the problems had been uncovered by the bank itself when it reported back in September 2015 to Austrac more than 50,000 unreported transactions over $10,000, which it must flag by law.\nHe said the first time the problems were raised at a senior level in the bank, including with him, was when Austrac flagged two unreported large transactions about a month earlier.\nCorrespondence with Austrac at that time did not come “anywhere near” the kind of market sensitive information that would require disclosure to the stock exchange and investors, Narev said.\nSince then “we’ve got different people, we’ve immediately fixed software problems, we’ve done major investments in ‘know your customer’ facilities, we’ve done major technology upgrades”.\nHe conceded not everything was fixed.\nAustrac alleges that, in one case in January, the bank picked up on $320,000 in cash deposits through IDMs made to a single account over five days but failed to give suspicious activity reports about large or structured deposits.\nThe agency alleges internal warnings included one in June 2015 to security managers by a Leichhardt branch staffer in Sydney, who said the lack of additional security measures around customers who were sending “millions and millions overseas” through IDMs was “crazy”. \nThe staffer bemoaned a lack of a “standard operating procedure” for a problem with suspicious cashflows through IDMs that had “been happening all over Sydney”.\n\n\n\n\nCommonwealth Bank beats expectations to deliver $9.88bn profit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsked if an apparent lack of action on these alerts flew in the face of the bank’s vaunted program to foster a whistleblowing culture, Narev said branch staff raising alerts did “an outstanding job”.\nHowever, “I’m reasonably confident we’re going to find that these things weren’t wilfully ignored,” he said.\nNarev said the fact Austrac was suing the bank did not reflect a breakdown in talks between the two. \nCivil proceedings were the only way the agency could secure a civil penalty against the bank and send a message to the sector, he said.\nThe ACTU president, Ged Kearney, said claims the Commonwealth Bank “turned a blind eye to money laundering” gave more reason for a royal commission into banking.\nThe bank’s “staggering” profit result came “at the same time as household incomes have gone backwards and people have not had a real pay rise in years”.\n“Customers’ home loan and credit card arrears are rising, meaning CBA is making a profit on the debts of working people who are struggling to make ends meet.”\nThe Commonwealth Bank, with its intention to pocket future corporate tax cuts, was a “clear example of how our banking sector is contributing to the growing problem of inequality”, Kearney said.\nChoice’s head of policy and campaigns, Erin Turner, said the bank’s credit card profits added “urgency” to a Productivity Commission recommendations on competition in Australia’s finance sector, due next year.\n",

        "text": "\nFormer Donald Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort was, as recently as last week, ghostwriting with a colleague, who has ties to Russian intelligence, an editorial about his past political work in Ukraine, federal prosecutors said.\nThe development sunk a deal Manafort had struck to be released from house arrest, to which he has been confined for five weeks.\nIn court documents released on Monday, prosecutors argued that Manafort should not be freed from house arrest because he had been working on the English-language editorial with a longtime colleague “who is currently based in Russia and assessed to have ties to a Russian intelligence service”.\n\n\n\n\nPaul Manafort: how decades of serving dictators led to role as Trump's go-to guy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManafort was placed under house arrest with electronic surveillance in October, after he was charged with federal felonies including tax fraud, money laundering and conspiracy. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges.\nManafort ran Trump’s presidential campaign for five months ending in August 2016, when his undeclared earnings in the former Soviet bloc came to light.\nManafort’s lawyers originally sought to modify the conditions of bail, offering multiple assets “to assure he will appear as required”. The offer included two New York and one Florida property valued at a combined $8m and life insurance policies valued at $4.5m.\nBut the government said that Manafort’s ghostwriting “casts doubt on Manafort’s willingness to comply with court orders”, which include a ban on “trying the case in the press”.\n“As late as 30 November 2017, Manafort and a colleague were ghostwriting an editorial in English regarding his political work for Ukraine,” the government says in court documents. \n“Because Manafort has now taken actions that reflect an intention to violate or circumvent the court’s existing orders, at a time one would expect particularly scrupulous adherence, the government submits that the proposed bail package is insufficient reasonably to assure his appearance as required.” \nIf the US district court for the District of Columbia sides with the government, Manafort could remain under house arrest until his trial sometime next year.\n",

        "text": "\nParliamentarians at the Council of Europe have expressed “great concern” at revelations in the Guardian and other media that detail how former members of the body were paid by Azerbaijan.\nThe revelations that former members of the Council of Europe’s parliamentary assembly (Pace) benefited from the oil-rich country’s international lobbying fund promise to shake up a body that is meant to set Europe’s standards for democratic probity.\nAfter details of leaked bank records emerged, members of Pace’s legal affairs committee inserted a last-minute amendment to a report on human rights in Azerbaijan, which had already been scheduled for debate on Tuesday. The new text urges the government of the president, Ilham Aliyev, to investigate the Laundromat schemes without delay.\n“The assembly notes with great concern reports linking the Azerbaijani government to a large money-laundering scheme,” states the text, which was passed after sharp debates among deputies meeting in Paris on Tuesday. “The assembly urges the Azerbaijani authorities to start an independent and impartial inquiry into these allegations without delay and, furthermore, cooperate fully with competent international authorities and bodies on this issue.”\nIn an unprecedented move, a group of Pace deputies plan to issue a dissenting opinion because they think the original report – drafted by a Belgian MP, Alain Destexhe – skims over the problem of deep-seated corruption in the oil-rich country.\nThe details of the payments came as an independent panel began confidential hearings into alleged corruption at Pace in Strasbourg, one of the world’s oldest human rights bodies.\nThe investigation into unethical practices was set up in July after Italian prosecutors accused Luca Volontè, an Italian former chair of the centre-right group in Pace, of accepting millions of euros in cash from Azerbaijan in exchange for supporting its government, which has been heavily criticised for subverting elections and jailing journalists and opponents.\nAzerbaijan, a member of the Council of Europe since 2001, has been accused of “caviar diplomacy”, using cash and gifts to buy influence – charges first detailed by the European Stability Initiative thinktank in 2012. The council notably voted down a critical report on Azerbaijan’s political prisoners in 2013.\n\n\n\n\nUK at centre of secret $3bn Azerbaijani money laundering and lobbying scheme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGerald Knaus, the ESI’s director, said it had taken years for the Volontè case to generate a reaction. “The Pace code of conduct is more lax than that of Fifa,” he told Le Monde, one of the team of newspapers that collaborated on the latest revelations about Azerbaijani money.\nBank documents show Azerbaijan funnelled about $2.9bn (£2.2bn) out of the country via a network of secret British companies to pay supporters, lobbyists and politicians in Europe, buy luxury goods and services, and launder money for the Azerbaijani elite.\nPieter Omtzigt, a Dutch centre-right MP who led calls for Pace to set up an investigation earlier this year, said the body was finally doing “serious and credible” work to clean up its act. But he said the Volontè case revealed a “systemic” problem within Pace, which was established after the second world war to safeguard democracy and human rights.\n“It clearly points to deficiencies within the whole assembly,” he told the Guardian. “In any normal parliament, if a foreign court decides that you have paid a member of parliament and that [person] is being investigated for corruption, some kind of procedure is staring you in the face.”\n\nAzerbaijani Laundromat atom\n\nOmtzigt said the parliamentary assembly had weak compliance in declaring gifts and hospitality, with only two items recorded in the gift register in 15 years.\nThe president of Pace, Pedro Agramunt, initially resisted calls to set up an inquiry, but lost that battle after his authority was weakened over an unrelated scandal.\nThe investigation, by a panel of three independent experts, will also look at “hidden practices that favour corruption”.\nAndres Herkel, an MP from Estonia – through which the Azerbaijani cash was routed – said Pace’s credibility had been damaged by the allegations. “Personally I never witnessed bribery in [the] strict and narrow sense. But I witnessed many strange interventions, opinions, voting,” said Herkel, who was the body’s rapporteur on Azerbaijan from 2004-10. \n“Many people were manipulated and now they start to understand what happened with their participation,” he said. “I think the Azeri lobby was rather unique in having so many different contacts and capacity to mobilise their ‘political friends’.”\nThe investigation comes at a difficult time for Pace. Agramunt is expected to be voted out of the presidency in October, but continues to fight for his post. He says the case against him is “an entirely bizarre case and a regrettable spectacle”.\nHe was criticised for his slow response to the corruption allegations, but his position only came under threat after it emerged he had met the Syrian leader, Bashar al-Assad, on a Russian government trip, days before a deadly chemical attack on civilians in Idlib. \nTiny Kox, head of the Unified European Left Group, a socialist delegation at the parliament, insisted Agramunt’s future would not hamper the investigation.\n“The vast majority of this assembly has lost confidence in the president; that is the problem of the assembly and the problem of the president and that will come to an end in the next … session in October,” Kox said.\nInvestigators needed time to do their work, he said. “We now have the tools to find out what really has happened.”\nThe assembly published a report on Tuesday detailing concerns about the “increasing number of allegations of violations of certain human rights and fundamental freedoms” in Azerbaijan. The report also raises concerns about allegations of executive control of the judiciary in the country.\nThe report, drafted by Destexhe, draws milder conclusions than similar bodies. While the Pace report notes that “reform of the judiciary is a work in progress”, the council’s human rights commissioner states that arrests are used to “silence and punish” opponents of the regime. A 2016 US state department report strikes a more robust tone, describing a “crackdown on civil society”. \nDestexhe’s call to avoid criticising the Azerbaijani authorities “harshly and publicly” is likely to disappoint critics, who argue that some international observers have been weak in calling out human rights abuses.\nVolontè acknowledges receiving money from Azerbaijan but insists it was for his foundation, and has vowed to fight the legal case against him.\n• This article was amended on 5 September 2017 to include the group that Tiny Kox leads.\n",

        "text": "\nLast weekend\nAttempting to muddy the waters ahead of special counsel Robert Mueller’s expected first indictments in his investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election and possible collusion by the future president’s team, Donald Trump tried to turn the focus on Hillary Clinton last weekend.\nTrump attacked his former election rival’s reported role in paying for research that led to the Steele dossier on links between Trump and Russia, her supposed contribution (much less plausible) to a deal that allowed the Russian nuclear energy agency to acquire a controlling stake in a Canadian company mining US uranium, and other past Clinton controversies. “DO SOMETHING!” he cried. \nThe president did take time out to resume his occasional role as a TV and theatre critic, bashing leftwing filmmaker Michael Moore for his recent Broadway show, which Trump called a “TOTAL BOMB”. But in a rare show of self-awareness, the president conceded that sending that tweet was “not at all presidential”. Baby steps ...\nAlso, a cyclist gave him the finger.\nMonday\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Paul Manafort outside court on Monday. Photograph: Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\nOn Monday Mueller’s first charges were announced: as expected, money-laundering accusations against Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort and associate Rick Gates, but also a guilty plea from ex-foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos, who lied to investigators about attempts to arrange a meeting between Trump and Vladimir Putin. \nIt’s hard to say which case is more damaging to Trump. The Papadopoulos plea shows another attempt – similar to the one made by Donald Trump Jr – to gain information on Clinton from apparent Russian sources, undermining again repeated claims there was no contact between the Trump campaign and Moscow. But the Manafort charges shows that Mueller is ranging far and wide in his investigation and is happy to prosecute financial crimes only tangentially related to Russian hacking. That may worry Trump, who has said that if the special counsel starts to delve into his finances he would consider it “a violation”. \nMeanwhile chief of staff John Kelly attempted to outdo his boss in inflammatory race-baiting, claiming a lack of ability to compromise led to the civil war and saying it was wrong to “take what is today accepted as right and wrong and go back ... and apply it back then”. As writer Ta-Nehisi Coates pointed out, only by excluding black people can you claim most Americans thought slavery was right during the civil war. \nTuesday\n\n\n\nTrump attempted to distance himself from Papadopoulos on Tuesday, calling him a “young, low level volunteer named George” who “few people knew”. \nLeaving aside the suspicion that Trump had gone out of his way to avoid trying to spell Papadopoulos’ surname, his main point was somewhat belied by an interview with the Washington Post in March 2016 in which he called the adviser an “excellent guy” and a picture he posted on Instagram captioned “meeting with my national security team” in which Papadopoulos can be seen four seats to his right.\nLater in the week Trump claimed he could not remember much about the meeting. Regular readers might recall Trump’s boast last week that he had “one of the great memories of all time”.\nWednesday\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  A makeshift memorial for victims of the attack. Photograph: Eduardo Munoz Alvarez/Getty Images\n\n\nIn sharp contrast to his reaction to the Las Vegas mass shooting a month earlier, after which he said any policy responses would have to wait until “time goes by”, Trump’s immediate response to the terrorist attack on a Manhattan bike path which killed eight people on Tuesday was to call for more “extreme vetting” of newcomers to the US and an end to the green card lottery which allows people from under-represented parts of the world to apply to live in America. But there was a lot of blame to go round – and some of it Trump sent the way of Chuck Schumer, one of the stricken city’s Democratic senators. \nThursday\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  A sketch of Sayfullo Saipov in federal court in Manhattan. Photograph: Jane Rosenberg/Reuters\n\n\nHaving called the US justice system a “joke” and a “laughing stock” on Wednesday and mulled sending suspect Sayfullo Saipov to the US detention camp at Guantanamo Bay, Trump reversed course on the latter on Thursday but pushed repeatedly instead for Saipov to receive the death penalty. Experts warned that the president’s comments might threaten Saipov’s chances of a fair trial and be used by the defence in the suspect’s favour. He went on to claim on Friday that the US had been attacking Isis “10 times harder” in revenge for the New York attack – something not supported by available military data.\nFriday\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Donald Trump was up bright and early for his Asia trip. Photograph: Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\nGetting up early to start a 10-day trip to Asia, the president fired off a few more tweets – once his Twitter account was back up and running, that is – attempting again to refocus attention away from his own Russia woes towards stories about the Democrats. Seizing upon claims in a new book by former acting chair of the Democratic national committee Donna Brazile that the Democratic primary process favoured Clinton over Bernie Sanders, Trump called for the Justice Department and FBI to investigate and noted: “I always felt I would be running and winning against Bernie Sanders, not Crooked H, without cheating, I was right.”\nAh well. There’s always 2020.\n",

        "text": "\nA former campaign aide to Donald Trump who sought to secure a meeting between the future US president and Vladimir Putin has pleaded guilty to lying to federal agents working for special counsel Robert Mueller as part of his investigation into possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia.\n\n\n\n\nPaul Manafort turns himself in as Trump-Russia inquiry heats up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeorge Papadopoulos’s plea was unsealed on Monday – the same day Trump’s former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, and a business associate, Rick Gates, were charged with money laundering, tax evasion, fraud and failing to register as agents of foreign interests.\nPapadopoulos is the first person to face criminal charges that cite interactions between Trump campaign associates and people claiming to be Russian intermediaries during the 2016 presidential campaign.\nThe Trump aide was told in April 2016 by an unnamed “professor” that Russia had “dirt” on Hillary Clinton in the form of “thousands of emails”. WikiLeaks released a database of thousands of Clinton’s emails in March that year, obtained through a freedom of information request. It released further emails hacked from the Democratic National Committee in July and from the Clinton aide John Podesta’s Gmail account in October. It is unclear if these are the emails the professor was referring to.\nPapadopoulos pleaded guilty on 5 October to one count of lying to FBI agents about the timing and nature of his interactions with “foreign nationals” who he thought had close connections to senior Russian government officials.\nThe document released by Mueller’s team also shows that unnamed campaign officials told Papadopoulos “great work” when he said he was trying to arrange a meeting between Trump and Putin and encouraged him to make a trip to meet Russian officials in lieu of Trump himself.\nPapadopoulos was a foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign, which he joined in March 2016 after serving as an adviser to Ben Carson. The 30-year-old is a graduate of DePaul University in Chicago and was one of five foreign policy advisers announced by Trump in a March interview with the Washington Post at which he referred to Papadopoulos as an “excellent guy”. A second of the five, Carter Page, has also been under investigation for his ties to Russia.\nTrump aides have said Papadopoulos played a limited role in the campaign and had no access to Trump. At a White House briefing on Monday, the press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, even dismissed Trump’s praise for the foreign policy adviser.\nAsked if the president still believed Papadopoulos was an excellent guy, Huckabee Sanders said: “Look, he was going through a list of names through the Washington Post and nothing more than that and complimentary of the people volunteering on behalf of the campaign.”\nAround the time Papadopoulos’s guilty plea became public, Trump tweeted to renew his claims that there had been no collusion between his campaign and Russian attempts to sway the election and attempt to shift the spotlight to his former rival Hillary Clinton.\n“Sorry, but this is years ago, before Paul Manafort was part of the Trump campaign,” the president wrote. “But why aren’t Crooked Hillary & the Dems the focus????? ... Also, there is NO COLLUSION!”\nPapadopoulos has agreed to provide information in the criminal investigation, according to the indictment unveiled on Monday. And he admitted to making false statements to the FBI in its investigation into whether the Trump campaign colluded with the Kremlin.\nUnder the terms of the deal with Mueller, the special counsel, Papadopoulos revealed new details of his own involvement in attempts to forge connections between the Trump campaign and Russian officials.\nA “statement of the offense” document released by the special counsel’s office – which Papadopoulos agrees is accurate as part of his guilty plea – states that “on or about March 31, 2016”, Papadopoulos attended a national security meeting with Trump and other advisers, at which Papadopoulos stated that he “could help arrange a meeting between then-candidate Trump and President Putin”.\n\n\n\nPapadopoulos told investigators as part of the plea that he befriended an unnamed London-based professor he believed had “substantial connections” to Russian government officials after he became an adviser to the campaign.\nPapadopoulos had initially told investigators that he met the professor before joining the Trump campaign – one of the lies he pleaded guilty to telling investigators.\nThe professor was not named in court documents but is described as a person who claimed to have close connections to the Kremlin and who told Papadopoulos that Russia had “dirt” on Clinton in the form of “thousands of emails”.\nThe court records state that the professor claimed to have met with officials in Moscow immediately before telling Papadopoulos about the emails.\n\n\n\nThe professor also introduced the Trump adviser to an unnamed female Russian national who Papadopoulos falsely believed was Putin’s niece.\n“He sought to use her Russian connections over a period of months in an effort to arrange a meeting between the campaign and Russian government officials,” according to the indictment.\nPapadopoulos was living in London when he learned – in March 2016 – that he would be joining the Trump campaign as an adviser. His principal aim in that role, he understood, was to improve US-Russia relations.\nPapadopoulos struck the plea bargain to avoid a potential five-year prison sentence and a fine of up to $250,000. The deal outlined to him suggests that he would be more likely to get a prison sentence of between zero and six months and a fine ranging from $500 to $9,500, taking into account his admission of guilt and his previously clean criminal record.\n",

On Monday, those bonds extended to the two men being jointly indicted on 12 counts including money laundering, making false statements to federal authorities and “conspiracy against the United States” in a document that describes Gates as “Manafort’s right-hand man”.\n\n\n\n\nPaul Manafort turns himself in as Trump-Russia inquiry heats up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGates, 45, had worked with Manafort since 2006 when he joined Davis Manafort, an international lobbying firm that did extensive work in Ukraine. \nHe joined the Trump campaign at the same time as Manafort in March 2016 and served as a top political aide, eventually being promoted to deputy campaign manager. \nHowever, Gates was linked to internal turmoil during the campaign. Most notoriously, according to a campaign source, the Trump aide signed off on and edited the plagiarized speech given by Melania Trump at the Republican national convention, when she was quickly revealed to have copied chunks of a speech by Michelle Obama.\nAfter the campaign, Gates worked at a pro-Trump fundraising Super Pac through to March this year and then stepped down as speculation swirled about both his and Manafort’s ties to Russia.\nGates first started working with Manafort in Ukraine where, based in Kiev, they served as consultants for the strongman Victor Yanukovych and his pro-Russian Party of Regions. They worked for him through 2014 when Yanukovych, the then president of Ukraine, was ousted after street protests and forced to flee to Russia.\n\n\n\n\nThe charges against Paul Manafort – full text of indictment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe indictment covers this work and alleges that Gates, along with Manafort, violated the law, by lobbying for the Party of Regions “without registering and providing the disclosures required”. It also covers money-laundering claims Gates wired $3m from offshore accounts into other bank accounts that he controlled. He allegedly used funds from offshore accounts to cover “personal expenses”, including his mortgage, children’s tuition and interior decorating of his Virginia residence.\nThe two also worked together at a private equity firm called Pericles Emerging Partners LP. The firm was set up to invest in businesses in Ukraine. \nIt only made one investment, backed by the Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, in a telecommunications firm called Black Sea Cable. The investment fizzled and ended in a financial dispute between Deripaska and the two political operatives.\nLawyers for Deripaska wrote: “It appears that Paul Manafort and Rick Gates have simply disappeared”, in a 2014 court filing in an attempt to recover at least some of the $19m investment.\n",

        "text": "\nHSBC has revealed that it closed accounts linked to South Africa’s Gupta family corruption investigation, admitting for the first time concerns about its potential ties to the snowballing scandal.\nThe bank said it had also flagged up its worries to the financial crime expert who has overseen its money-laundering controls since it was fined a record $1.9bn in 2012 for processing cash for Mexican drug lords and terrorists.\nRegulators in the UK are already looking into whether HSBC and another bank, Standard Chartered, had ties to the Guptas after former cabinet minister Peter Hain passed a list of transactions to the chancellor warning of their “possible criminal complicity”.\nHSBC admitted on Friday that it was forced to close bank accounts held by “front companies” associated with the Guptas.\nThe bank has previously declined to comment on its involvement, but revealed its concerns after details of transactions linked to the Guptas emerged.\nThe bank said: “HSBC has been reviewing its exposure to the Guptas for some time, and has closed a number of accounts for associated front companies wherever we have found them.\n“As we identify or are presented with new information, we will continue to investigate further and take appropriate action.” \nHSBC is understood to have closed the accounts in 2014, the same year that Standard Chartered said it had shut down accounts linked to the Guptas.\nIt also notified Michael Cherkasky, who monitors the bank’s anti-money laundering controls as a condition of its 2012 settlement with the US Department of Justice and the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).\nThe bank issued a statement in response to evidence contained in the GuptaLeaks, a tranche of files released in South Africa and reported in the Wall Street Journal.\nThe documents reportedly reveal that HSBC bank accounts in Dubai were used to channel millions of dollars via companies linked to contracts to sell Chinese rail locomotives to South Africa.\nThe contracts are being examined as part of an ongoing corruption investigation into whether the wealthy Gupta family benefited from wielding influence over South Africa’s president Jacob Zuma.\nLord Hain, who first raised concerns about UK banks’ links to the Guptas last month, said: “This demonstrates yet again that any global company doing any business with the Guptas or Zumas is guaranteed to be badly contaminated, just as Bell Pottinger was going bankrupt, and KPMG, McKinsey and SAP have also been.”\nBanks like HSBC must not be conduits for alleged money-laundering, Hain said, adding that all the evidence points to not just HSBC but other banks having been such conduits.\nThe Guptas, who have not responded to requests for comment about the allegations by the Guardian, have previously denied any wrongdoing.\nFresh detail about transactions involving HSBC could lead to the bank facing investigation by US authorities, because they were made in dollars and cleared by the bank’s New York office.\nThe FBI is already examining whether businesses linked to the Guptas moved money through the American financial system, according to reports in the US.\nThe bank has been battling to increase its resilience to financial crime since the 2012 fine, when it reached a settlement with the US authorities over allegations it had allowed money from the Sinaloa drug cartel to be laundered via its Mexican branches.\nAs part of the deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) Cherkasky was installed in July 2013 to oversee HSBC’s efforts to clean up its act.\nThe bank has said it is on track to have its anti-money laundering and sanctions policy framework in place by the end of this year, although Cherkasky has uncovered issues along the way. \n“HSBC is determined to prevent criminals from accessing the financial system,” the bank said. \n“This is inherently challenging because those who seek to launder money are often extremely sophisticated, hiding behind legitimate companies, layers of front companies, connected parties and individuals that have controlling interests in the subject companies.\nIn February HSBC revealed it was investigated by the FCA over potential breaches of money laundering rules that had been highlighted by Cherkasky.\nCherkasky’s final report is thought to be scheduled for next March, after which it will be up to the DoJ to decide whether the terms of the DPA have been met.\nOn Friday Standard Chartered had its DPA – originally agreed around the same time as HSBC’s – extended for a second time, until July 2018.\n",

The company announced 18 months later that it had sold half its stake for $2.5bn.\nIsraeli authorities investigated the claim that Steinmetz, along with a number of other Israelis, acquired the asset by paying tens of millions of dollars in bribes to senior public officials in Guinea. Steinmetz and BSGR deny the allegation, which they say concerns an “obsolete” matter.\nOn Monday, Israeli police issued a statement that said those detained were suspected of having “acted together and methodically with the prime suspect in order to create and present fictitious contracts and deals ... on a foreign country in order to transfer funds and launder money”.\n",

        "text": "\nWhy is Australia’s largest bank in hot water?\nThe Commonwealth Bank of Australia is accused of a massive series of breaches of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act.\nThe CBA was the target of an investigation by the federal government’s financial intelligence agency Austrac, which claims to have unmasked more than 53,700 violations of the act since 2012.\nThese allegedly range from lax reporting around large transactions that Austrac needs to know about – including customers the bank had identified as possible terrorists or terrorism funders – to a failure to act on police warnings about suspected laundering of drug profits.\n\n\n\n\nNick Xenophon: bank CEOs should face jail if found guilty of money laundering\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAustrac is suing the bank in the federal court over what it claims is “serious and systemic noncompliance” with the act.\nThe agency wants the bank punished with a fine. If the bank were found guilty, this could be very hefty indeed.\nHow hefty?\nIn the unlikely event the bank were found guilty and fined the maximum amount for each of the 53,700 breaches: $966.6bn.\nThe bank’s chief executive, Ian Narev, has said the idea of a trillion-dollar fine is “completely out of the ballpark”.\nAustrac’s pursuit of the gambling company Tabcorp over breaches of money-laundering and terrorism-funding laws resulted in March in reportedly the largest civil penalty in Australian corporate history: $45m.\nWhat are intelligent deposit machines?\nMuch of Austrac’s claim against the Commonwealth Bank relates to its rollout of so-called “intelligent deposit machines” from 2012.\nIDMs take cash or cheque deposits, automatically count them and instantly credit them to a CBA account. Austrac says criminal syndicate players were able to set up CBA accounts using fake names. The cash can be immediately transferred to other accounts anywhere.\nCustomers can anonymously deposit up to $20,000 each time, as many times a day as they want, using other bank cards to avoid identifying themselves.\nAustrac alleges the bank did nothing to assess the risk its IDMs would be exploited by criminal syndicates and terrorists until three years after their introduction, by which time they had taken $8.9bn in cash deposits.\nThis was despite an “exponential rise” in cash deposits through IDMs and alerts from law enforcement of “significant instances of money laundering through IDMs”, according to court papers filed by Austrac. \nWhat does this have to do with terrorism?\nFive customers whom the bank itself had assessed “as posing a potential risk of terrorism or terrorism financing” were among those to make big cash deposits through IDMs, Austrac says. They were involved in six transactions each of more than $10,000. The bank is obliged to report any transactions of this size to Austrac within 10 days. But CBA was late in flagging these, and accounts linked to these customers were left open for at least 18 months, Austrac alleges. \nSix late reports doesn’t seem like a systemic problem – what else?\nAustrac alleges there were a further 1,640 deposits totalling about $17.3m that were linked to money-laundering syndicates that the Australian federal police were either prosecuting or investigating.\nIn all, Austrac says there were 53,506 large deposits, or 95% of the transactions through IDMs totalling $624.7m, that the bank reported late. \nHow late?\nYears late in some cases, according to Austrac. The first big deposits were taken by IDMs from November 2012; the bank sent through two late reports to Austrac in August 2015, with the remaining 53,504 arriving a month later.\nBetter late than never?\nAustrac says delays in the bank’s reporting have “resulted in lost intelligence and evidence (including CCTV footage), further money laundering and lost proceeds of crime”. Also, the bank completely failed to report other suspicious activity as it was supposed to, the agency says.\n\n\n\n\nCommonwealth Bank accused of money laundering and terrorism-financing breaches\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLike what?\nLike cases of suspected money laundering the bank allegedly detected, where cash deposits that were promptly transferred overseas and within Australia were “structured” to go just below the radar (the $10,000 limit that should invite Austrac scrutiny). The bank picked up the patterns of illegal “structuring” but repeatedly failed to make a “suspicious matter report” to Austrac, on time or at all, the agency alleges. In one case in January, the bank picked up on $320,000 in cash deposits through IDMs made to a single bank account over five days. The bank reported “suspicious third-party transfers” into this account late to Austrac but gave no SMR about either large or structured deposits, the agency alleges.\nIn some cases, the bank simply ignored alerts from law enforcement of “unlawful activity”, Austrac says. \nSurely the bank itself monitored accounts or checked out customers it suspected were laundering proceeds of crime?\nIn “many cases”, no, says Austrac. Often the bank looked no further than making an SMR, and would not move to identify a customer’s source of wealth or shut accounts unless there had been a string of these reports, the agency says. And when it did shut accounts, it generally gave 30 days’ notice, meaning “suspicious transactions” from some of these continued unchecked under the bank’s nose, Austrac alleges.\nWhat else allegedly went on under the bank’s nose?\nAustrac’s court filings single out five money-laundering syndicates, involving 16 people who have since been charged, that raised the bank’s suspicions using IDMs. \nOne syndicate shifted $9.1m to Hong Kong in the months after the bank picked up suspicious patterns to its transactions via 16 accounts, 15 of them in fake names. After the AFP asked the bank to shut down transactions on these accounts, the syndicate laundered another $4.5m using the same method already identified by the bank – via accounts opened in fake names by “certain foreign nationals on holiday visas” with deposits through IDMs involving “blatant structuring” and swift overseas transfers. Austrac alleges the bank failed to report suspicions around this syndicate around transactions worth $22.7m.\nIn another case involving a drug import group, the bank is accused of failing to report suspicions about $5.7m in transactions, including to accounts linked to three people who had been arrested.\nThe bank had identified an account linked to a third syndicate that manufactured and imported drugs as “high risk and suspicious” by April 2015 after $14.7m had been sent offshore. But it then allowed the account to be used to shift a further $11.8m overseas while the suspicious patterns continued, Austrac alleges.\nIn a fourth case, in which the bank is accused of failing to report suspicions around transactions worth $34.3m, it allegedly allowed members of a drug importation syndicate to continue transactions after the AFP warned in late 2015 the accounts were linked to an investigation of “serious criminal offences”.\nThe bank is also accused of failing to report suspicious transactions after warnings by NSW police in 2015 that accounts were linked to an investigation of a “cuckoo smurfing” syndicate, where money is laundered through innocent third-party accounts. \nWhat does the bank say?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Austrac is suing the Commonwealth Bank in the federal court. Photograph: Dave Hunt/AAP\n\n\n“Mistakes can be made,” the CBA said on Monday, two days before its annual general meeting, where the matter will inevitably be raised by concerned shareholders.\n“We know that because we are a big organisation, these mistakes can have significant impact.”\nThe bank has already said it took “our regulatory obligations extremely seriously and we are one of the largest reporters to Austrac”.\nNarev has said the bank is investigating the allegations: “Whenever we get matters that impact the reputation of the bank we make sure we get to the bottom of it.”\nBut on Monday, it cited a coding error in its IDMs that was only discovered in 2015 in reply to the allegations it failed to give timely reports of transactions over $10,000. \n“The vast majority of the reporting failures alleged in the statement of claim relate specifically to this coding error,” it said. \nWhat next?\nThe allegations against CBA are grist for the mill for those calling for a royal commission into banking, a move the Turnbull government has already rebuffed.\nNarev has ruled out standing aside over the matter, which follows earlier scandals around the bank’s insurance and financial planning arms.\n\n\n\n\nBanks fear 'serious damage' to reputation from royal commission, Anna Bligh says\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Narev and fellow executives face another backlash over their pay packets from shareholders, who last year dealt an unprecedented first strike against the bank’s remuneration report.\nThe Tasmanian Greens senator Peter Whish-Wilson has called for the CBA board to “scrap any bonus payments they were considering giving to the CEO and senior executives”. \n“The public will never forgive an organisation that pays millions in bonuses to people who couldn’t even ensure that their company could obey laws put in place to stop organised crime,” Whish-Wilson said last Friday.\nSenator Nick Xenophon has flagged introducing a bill with criminal sanctions – including jail terms – against bank executives “who systemically fail to abide by the rules” on money laundering and terrorism financing.\n",

        "text": "\nPaul Manafort may be about to become the most infamous Airbnb host in America. The former chair of the Trump campaign was charged – along with his “right-hand man” Rick Gates – with conspiring against the United States, money laundering and acting as unregistered agents of a foreign power, according to an indictment unsealed on Monday. \nThe millions they made as part of the alleged scheme helped pay for a glitzy portfolio of properties that the government intends to seize if the charges stick.\nThe pair surrendered to US authorities on Monday as part of an investigation by Robert Mueller, the special counsel leading a broad investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.\nAccording to the indictment, Manafort illegally lobbied on behalf of the former Ukrainian president Victor Yanukovych and used hidden offshore cash to buy the properties. He rented out one – a condominium in New York’s SoHo – on Airbnb, while falsely claiming it was the residence of his daughter and son-in-law.\nThe 31-page indictment paints a detailed picture of a relatively simple fraud scheme to turn Ukrainian money into American property, which Manafort then mortgaged to access millions in ready US cash.\nUsing his firm Davis Manafort International (DMI), Manafort and Gates “funneled millions of dollars in payments into foreign nominee companies and bank accounts” in Cyprus, Saint Vincent, the Grenadines and the Seychelles. The existence of these companies was hidden and not disclosed to the tax authorities.\nManafort and Gates also concealed their work as agents for Ukraine and its political parties.\nManafort used the funds to “enjoy a lavish lifestyle in the United States, without paying taxes on that income”. Hundreds of thousands were wired to a Virginia rug merchant and a New York clothing store, for example. About $20,000 went to his New York housekeepers and $164,740 went to a Hamptons-based landscaper.\nManafort spent millions on luxury goods and services for himself and his family, buying multi-million dollar properties and obtaining loans on those properties to use as spending money.\nHe defrauded the institutions that loaned money on the properties so that they would lend him money at more favorable rates, according to the indictment.\nMore than $75m flowed through the offshore accounts; Manafort used $18m to buy property, goods and services in the US. Gates moved $3m in cash from offshore accounts to other accounts he controlled. In the process, the pair “repeatedly provided false information to financial bookkeepers, tax accountants, and legal counsel, among others”.\nIt is illegal to lobby on behalf of a foreign principal in the US without registering the affiliation. Anyone doing so must disclose, under oath, the name of the foreign principal, payments and the measures that have undertaken.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Rick Gates served as campaign aide to Trump. Along with Manafort, he was ordered on Monday to surrender to federal authorities . Photograph: Evan Vucci/AP\n\n\nManafort and Gates engaged two Washington DC firms (called Company A and Company B in the indictment) to lobby on Yanukovych’s behalf. While the pair maintained they were the clients of the companies and not in the driving seat, in 2012 Gates asked the firms to prepare an assessment of their work so “Paul” could brief the “president” – presumably Yankukovych – “on what Ukraine has done well and what it can do better as we move into 2013.”\nAbout $4m was used from the pair’s offshore accounts to pay for a report on the propriety of imprisoning Yanukovych’s presidential rival, Yulia Tymoshenko.\nYet Manafort and Gates have claimed that “at no time did our firm or members provide any direct lobbying support” to Yanukovych or his supporters, according to the indictment.\nIn 2016, after numerous press reports about Manafort’s work on behalf of Ukraine, the department of justice sought to determine if the pair and their company had indeed acted as agents of a foreign principle without registering the fact, in contravention of the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA).\nIn letters approved by Manafort and Gates, the company said DMI’s activities “did not include meetings or outreach in the US” and the pair “did not recall meeting with or conducting outreach to US government officials or US media” on the issues.\nBut Mueller alleges the pair not only selected Company A and B but also provided weekly scheduled calls with them to direct “specific lobbying steps”. According to the indictment, they communicated directly with Yanukovych about their progress and with US officials in connection with this work and paid the firms more than $2m from their offshore accounts.\nThe indictment further alleges that this work made a fortune for the pair and was paid into secret offshore accounts.\nIn order to bring the cash back home, Manafort turned to the residential property market, the indictment charges. \nIn 2012, Manafort, through a vehicle called MC Soho Holdings owned by him and his family, bought a condominium on Howard Street in SoHo for some $2.85m. The money came from accounts Manafort controlled in Cyprus. The apartment was listed on Airbnb and similar sites for thousands of dollars a week, and Manafort claimed tax breaks on the property.\nIn 2015, Manafort applied for a mortgage on the property. Banks will offer larger loans on owner-occupied properties, so Manafort “falsely represented to the bank” that the property was a secondary home used by his daughter and son-in-law, the indictment states. \n“Remember, he [the banker] believes that you and [Manafort’s daughter] are living there,” Manafort wrote to his son-in-law in January of 2016, according to the indictment.\nGates allegedly assisted in the scheme by creating a document that listed the SoHo apartment as the couple’s secondary home. In March 2016, Manafort received a $5m loan for $3.18m on the property.\nIn 2012, Manafort bought a brownstone on Union Street in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, for $3m in cash. That money, too, came from Cyprus accounts. In late 2015 and early 2016 he applied for a “construction loan”, saying he would use $1.4m to improve the property.\nInstead, the indictment alleges, Manafort told his tax preparer he was using the cash to pay off another mortgage and used hundreds of thousands of dollars from the loan to make a down payment on another property in California.\nIf convicted, US authorities will seek to claim both of the New York City properties and two more: a 10-bed, six bathroom $7.8 property in Water Mill, New York, a hamlet of the ritzy seaside town of Southampton on Long Island; and a $1.6m four bedroom home in the waterside Washington DC commuter town of Arlington, Virginia.\n",

        "text": "\nCompanies across the EU will be forced to disclose their true owners under new legislation prompted by the release of the Panama Papers.\nAnti-corruption campaigners applauded the agreement as a major step in the fight against tax evasion and money laundering, but expressed disappointment that trusts will mostly escape scrutiny.\nThe revised terms of the EU’s fourth anti-money laundering directive include:\n\nA requirement for companies to disclose their beneficial, or true, owners in a publicly available register.\nData on the beneficial owners of trusts to be available to tax and law enforcement authorities, as well as sectors with an obligation to follow anti-money laundering rules, such as lawyers.\nA requirement for member states to verify beneficial ownership information submitted to their registers.\nExtending anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism regulations to apply to virtual currencies, provision of tax services and those dealing in works of art.\n\nEU member states will have 18 months to transpose the new directive into domestic legislation. As a current member of the EU, the UK will implement the legislation. \n“This is a big breakthrough and confirms that full transparency of corporate ownership is now the global standard against which other countries will be judged,” said Laure Brillaud, the anti-money laundering policy officer at Transparency International EU. \n“The EU deserves credit for taking this bold leap to end the secrecy that facilitates corruption, tax evasion and other crimes.”\nGlobal Witness applauded the move “in the face of opposition from countries like the UK, Luxembourg, Ireland, Malta and Cyprus,” but criticised the failure to introduce the same requirements for trusts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n \nApril 2016: The biggest leak ever - Panama Papers video explainer\n\n\nUnlike companies, which are legal entities, trusts are effectively agreements between two or more parties, which has traditionally allowed them to escape aspects of tax and crime legislation.\n“Today’s deal will make it much harder for the criminal and corrupt to use EU companies, but trusts are an even better ‘getaway car’. They are the ultimate black box, so secretive that even the taxman and the police can’t see who is behind them,” said Murray Worthy, a senior campaigner at Global Witness.\n“Despite numerous scandals showing their use in cases of corruption and tax evasion, the deal reached today will do almost nothing to tackle this.”\nThe changes also include new rules on the use of pre-paid cards. The cards, which are issued by companies including MasterCard and Visa, can be loaded with cash and used online and in shops without need for the same checks as are made on debit and credit card payments. After the terrorist attacks in Paris, French authorities found that the perpetrators had used prepaid cards in their preparations. \nUnder the revised rules, member states will have to limit how much can be spent anonymously to €150 in a shop and €50 online. \nThe agreement is likely to make it harder for the UK to resist imposing the same transparency standards on its network of crown dependencies and overseas territories, many of which are major tax havens.\nNegotiations to revise the fourth anti-money laundering directive were launched partly as a response to publication of the Panama Papers in 2016. The leaked Mossack Fonseca files revealed how offshore companies are used to hide assets and wealth.\nIn his first UK lecture since leaving office, the former prime minister David Cameron said on Wednesday that “the cancer of corruption is developing, metastasising and becoming more commonplace, more complex, more multi-layered, elusive and ingrained”.\nHe also defended his record on engaging with the UK’s crown dependencies and overseas territories, which have consistently resisted international moves towards greater transparency.\n",

        "text": "\nThe UK and other EU governments are planning a crackdown on bitcoin amid growing concerns that the digital currency is being used for money laundering and tax evasion.\nThe Treasury plans to regulate bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to bring them in line with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financial legislation. Traders will be forced to disclose their identities, ending the anonymity that has made the currency attractive for drug dealing and other illegal activities.\nUnder the EU-wide plan, online platforms where bitcoins are traded will be required to carry out due diligence on customers and report suspicious transactions. The UK government is negotiating amendments to the anti-money-laundering directive to ensure firms’ activities are overseen by national authorities.\nThe Treasury said: “We are working to address concerns about the use of cryptocurrencies by negotiating to bring virtual currency exchange platforms and some wallet providers within anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing regulation.”\n\n\n Q&A What is bitcoin and is it a bad investment?  \n\n\n Show \n\n\n Hide  \n\n\nBitcoin is the first, and the biggest, \"cryptocurrency\" – a decentralised tradable digital asset. Whether it is a bad investment is the big question. Bitcoin can only be used as a medium of exchange and in practice has been far more important for the dark economy than it has for most legitimate uses. The lack of any central authority makes bitcoin remarkably resilient to censorship, corruption – or regulation. That means it has attracted a range of backers, from libertarian monetarists who enjoy the idea of a currency with no inflation and no central bank, to drug dealers who like the fact that it is hard (but not impossible) to trace a bitcoin transaction back to a physical person.\n\n\n\n\nWas this helpful?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you for your feedback.\n\n\n\n\nThe rules are expected to come into effect in the next few months. The Treasury said digital currencies could be used to enable and facilitate cybercrime. It added: “There is little current evidence of them being used to launder money, though this risk is expected to grow.”\nThe bosses of Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan have criticised bitcoin as a vehicle to commit fraud and other crimes. But Sir Jon Cunliffe, a deputy governor of the Bank of England, last week said the digital currency was too small to pose a systemic threat to the global economy. He also cautioned that bitcoin investors needed “to do their homework”.\nBitcoin was trading at $11,566 on Monday. It hit a fresh record high of $11,800 on Sunday but fell to $10,554 on news of the regulatory crackdown.\nThe Labour MP John Mann, a member of the House of Commons Treasury select committee, suggested MPs would look into the regulation of virtual currencies.\nHe told the Daily Telegraph: “These new forms of exchange are expanding rapidly and we’ve got to make sure we don’t get left behind – that’s particularly important in terms of money laundering, terrorism or pure theft.\n“It would be timely to have a proper look at what this means. It may be that we want speed up our use of these kinds of thing in this country, but that makes it all the more important that we don’t have a regulatory lag.”\n\n\n\n\nBitcoin: is it a bubble waiting to burst or a good investment?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStephen Barclay, the economic secretary to the Treasury, set out the government’s plans in a written parliamentary answer in October. “The UK government is currently negotiating amendments to the anti-money-laundering directive that will bring virtual currency exchange platforms and custodian wallet providers into anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing regulation, which will result in these firms’ activities being overseen by national competent authorities for these areas.\n“The government supports the intention behind these amendments. We expect these negotiations to conclude at EU level in late 2017 or early 2018.”\n• Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.\n",

        "text": "\nMore than £630m was wiped off the value of UK oil services group Petrofac when the company revealed it had suspended its chief operating officer and taken other measures in response to a criminal investigation by the Serious Fraud Office (SFO). \nPetrofac said Marwan Chedid had been suspended until further notice and resigned from the board. The chief executive, Ayman Asfari, a major Tory donor who owns 18% of the firm, is to stay in his post but will be excluded from all matters connected to the investigation.\nThe SFO said on 12 May that it was investigating the company, its employees and agents for suspected bribery, corruption and money laundering. \nThe company’s shares closed down nearly 30%, falling from 615p to 430p to value the company at about £1.5bn. Twelve months ago, they were changing hands at around 800p.\n\n\n\n\nTory donor questioned by SFO over corruption claims at Petrofac\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe SFO probe is linked to its investigation of Unaoil, a Monaco-based firm that has been accused of corruptly securing contracts for multinationals. Unaoil has denied any wrongdoing.\nPetrofac’s Asfari and Chedid were arrested, questioned under caution by the SFO and released without charge.\nAsfari , who has donated £700,000 to the Conservative party over the past 8 years, is one of the government’s network of business ambassadors, with the role of acting as an advocate for the UK abroad. \nA government spokeswoman said Asfari would continue in the role and refused to comment on the SFO investigation. The decision on whether he should remain an ambassador lies with Theresa May.\nPetrofac employed Unaoil for consultancy work in Kazakhstan between 2002 and 2009. Petrofac said it had commissioned an independent investigation last year into media allegations in relation to Unaoil and passed its findings on to the SFO, which then told Petrofac that it did not accept those findings. The SFO has also told Petrofac that it does not consider it has received cooperation from the company.\nPetrofac has now set up a committee of the board led by its chairman, Rijnhard van Tets, to engage with the SFO and is in the process of appointing a senior external specialist to oversee the group’s management of the investigation. The specialist will also review Petrofac’s compliance processes.\nVan Tets said: “These decisions signal the board’s determination to cooperate fully with the SFO and its investigation, whilst ensuring Petrofac continues to deliver for its clients.”\nPetrofac stressed that the action taken did “not in any way seek to prejudge the outcome of the SFO’s investigation”. It added that it had provided “large volumes of information in response to very broad requests” made by the SFO. \nThe most recent donation to the Conservative party from Asfari and his wife was £40,000 last December. The Syrian-born businessman is a member of the leader’s group, an elite set of donors who are invited to dine with the prime minister.\n",

        "text": "\nTheresa May’s election campaign has received a £50,000 donation from a Syrian-born businessman who was recently interviewed by the Serious Fraud Office, according to official data.\nAyman Asfari, the chief executive of the oil services group Petrofac, gave the money to the Tories just days before the Guardian disclosed that he was recently interviewed under caution by the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) over suspected bribery, corruption and money laundering by the company.\nAsfari’s donation has been matched by his wife, Sawsan. He is also one of the prime minister’s business ambassadors, and is a member of the Leader’s Group, the elite group of donors who give over £50,000 a year, and are invited to dinners with the prime minister and senior government ministers. The Asfaris have now given £819,350 to the party.\nThe investigation is part of the SFO’s inquiry into Unaoil, a Monaco-based firm that has been accused of corruptly securing contracts for multinationals. Unaoil has denied any wrongdoing. A spokesman for Petrofac said the company was cooperating with the authorities. It has also said that an investigation by its lawyers and auditors found no evidence that any director “was aware of the alleged misconduct”.\nElectoral Commission records show that the Conservatives raised more than £4.1m in the first week of the general election campaign, with Labour raising just over £2.7m. The Liberal Democrats raised only £180,000 in the same time period, which is likely to raise further questions about their appeal under Tim Farron.\nThe commission’s figures show that Theresa May’s party has launched a major fundraising drive among its wealthiest donors, with the aim of raising £19m for the general election.\n\nElection donations\n\nThe biggest donor to the Conservatives was John Griffin, the founder of the taxi company Addison Lee, who gave £900,000. Griffin stepped down as Addison Lee chairman in 2014.\nHedge fund executives who supported the remain campaign are also giving money to the party again. They include John Armitage, the founder of the hedge fund Egerton Capital, who has given £400,000 and Andrew Law, chairman and chief executive of the $8bn Caxton Associates, who has given £250,000. \nThe trade union Unite gave Labour three separate donations in the week 3-9 May, adding up to £2.36m in total. The figure represents 88% of the donations declared by the party in the time period.\nThe first release of donations by the Electoral Commission for this campaign shows more than £7m has already been donated to all political parties.\nThe Conservatives’ fundraising drive followed concerns that the party’s income had dipped since the EU referendum because pro-remain donors and friends of David Cameron were keeping their chequebooks shut.\n\nDonations by party\n\n\n\n\n\nConservatives eye £19.5m funding drive ahead of June election\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLabour is expecting to spend less than half as much as the Tories on the general election campaign amid a drive for money donations from its 500,000 members.\nInsiders said Labour had already raised around £3.8m for a possible poll when May announced the snap election. The party added that it had received £1m in small donations.\nThe Conservatives consistently spend close to the £19m general election spending limit.\nPolitical parties are able to spend £30,000 for every seat they contest during the regulated period. Labour is expected to contest almost all 650 seats.\nLabour under Ed Miliband spent £12.2m on the short campaign in 2015, compared with £8m under Brown in 2010. In 2005, Blair’s last general election campaign, it spent £17.9m.\n",

        "text": "\nTop story: ‘We can’t do 40 free-trade agreements …’ \nHello – it’s Warren Murray with the main headlines this morning.\nBritain does not have the capacity to negotiate new free-trade agreements (FTAs) and is headed for a “cut-and-paste” Brexit where existing EU pacts are replaced with “copycat” deals that continue the same arrangements. The admission by senior government sources increases pressure on Theresa May to broker continuing membership of the single market and customs union.\n“We can’t do 40 FTAs, we haven’t got the capacity to do that,” the Guardian has been told by insiders. May and Japan’s prime minister have agreed to strike a “copycat” post-Brexit trade deal, and No 10 hopes more of these can be reached with other nations to help secure continuity and confidence.\nThe Labour MP and leading Open Britain supporter Darren Jones said May should negotiate to stay within existing EU trade mechanisms – “given we have not negotiated a single trade deal for 40 years” – and protect its most important trading arrangement: the one with the continent. Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, said the situation had become a “Whitehall farce … First we learned that countries such as Japan and India have no interest in doing separate trade deals with the UK. Now we learn that even if there was appetite for such deals, we wouldn’t have the capacity to negotiate them.”\n\n‘Stakes could not be higher’ – North Korea is “begging for war” with its refusal to back away from developing nuclear weapons, the top US diplomat has warned. Nikki Haley, ambassador to the United Nations, called for the toughest possible sanctions against Kim Jong-un’s regime after its latest nuclear test and suggested the diplomatic endgame had been reached. The security council has imposed seven sets of sanctions on North Korea since it first tested a nuclear device in 2006. Diplomats have said the security council might now consider banning North Korean textile exports, closing the skies to its national airline and cutting off its oil supplies. South Korea rattled nerves this morning when its defence minister suggested it might consider hosting American nuclear weapons, in what would be a dramatic escalation of the situation. The defence ministry quickly rowed back, saying Seoul remained committed to the denuclearisation of the peninsula – however, there have been calls within the South for the country to develop its own nuclear deterrent.\n\n‘Azerbaijani Laundromat’ – Shadowy British companies have been at the centre of a £3bn money laundering and payments scheme designed to promote the interests of Azerbaijan and deflect criticism of its strongman president, the Guardian can reveal. Some of this money funnelled through the UK went to European politicians and journalists as part of an international lobbying operation, though there is no suggestion that all the recipients were aware of the original source. A portion of the “Azerbaijani Laundromat” cash was spent in Britain on luxury goods and private school fees. Two of the companies were limited partnerships in Scotland, which has become known as an attractive legal jurisdiction for secretly moving money. Revelations that some of the money went to members of the Council of Europe’s parliament could prove pivotal as the body faces a shake-up over alleged corruption.\n\nToxins in school fruit – Pesticide residues in free fruit and vegetables given to school pupils aged 4-6 mean the Department of Health should switch the scheme to organic, according to campaigners. While government testing has shown the levels are within limits that are deemed safe, they are generally worse than produce found on supermarket shelves. Experts say that even within safety margins, there could be as yet unknown “cocktail” effects from young children being exposed to multiple chemicals. On the other hand, there are the balancing health benefits of children eating more fruit and vegetables. The Pesticide Action Network says handing out organic produce instead would cost around 1p per student, per day.\n\nVegan ambiguous – Jeremy Corbyn had to chew over the question when asked whether he is fully embracing veganism, a diet without any animal products. The Labour leader, a vegetarian for decades, revealed that while he has been eating more vegan foods, he has not completely made the switch. “I eat more and more vegan food, and have more and more vegan friends … I think what has improved so much is vegetarian and vegan food has got so much better in recent years. So I’m going through the process all right? I won’t go any further than that.” Vegans avoid all animal products including eggs and dairy, while vegetarians avoid just meat and fish.\nLunchtime read: How North Korea could have been stopped\nShould we be surprised that North Korea has developed nuclear weapons when other countries still have 22,000 between them – despite having pledged in 1970 to wind down their arsenals? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n \nCould North Korea trigger a nuclear war?\n\n\nSimon Tisdall today highlights the mixed successes and failures of the Nuclar Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPPT). On the success side, only Israel, India and Pakistan are known to have joined the nuclear “club” since the US, Russia, China, France and the UK signed the treaty. Which brings us to the NPPT’s failures. Instead of disarming as promised, the main nuclear powers have continued to maintain and modernise their arsenals, making Kim Jong-un’s recklessness and bad faith a product of their own, Tisdall writes. \nSport\nDele Alli has risked disciplinary action after cameras caught him making a one-finger salute, sparking suggestions it had been directed at the referee, late in England’s 2-1 World Cup qualifying victory over Slovakia. Meanwhile, Windsor Park provided a raucous, bouncing and again triumphant stage as Northern Ireland secured second place plus a probable play-off berth with a superb defeat of the Czech Republic.\nIn New York, Juan Martín del Potro pulled off one of tennis’s most remarkable comebacks to reach the quarter-finals of the US Open, where he will face Roger Federer. Rafael Nadal also progressed, the Spaniard having ominously got his game face on at last. Chris Froome can take a decisive step towards victory at the Vuelta a España in today’s time trial in northern Spain. And Dawid Malan is primed to cash in with the bat and book a place in England’s Ashes squad when he plays in the deciding third Test against the West Indies starting on Thursday.\nBusiness\nThe tensions on the Korean peninsula continue to keep investors on edge. Most of the main Asian markets including the Nikkei were slightly down after falling to three-week lows on the back of the crisis in recent days. US markets were closed on Monday for labour day.\nOvernight the pound was buying US$1.29 and €1.09.\nThe papers\nAlmost everyone (except the Guardian) has the same person pictured on the front page today: the Duchess of Cambridge. The announcement of a third child on the way for the royal couple means coverage galore.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Guardian front page, 5 September 2017.\n\n\nThe Sun probably goes a step closer to the story than others with the headline “The Warsaw Act”, speculating about the moment of conception and whether it was during a trip to Poland. The Mirror hints that Kate may be experiencing morning sickness but splashes on a story about Wayne Rooney. The Mail goes all MailOnline with a gushing headline: “As Kate tells the world she is pregnant again, an unmissable picture pullout to celebrate her gorgeous growing family”. The other news of the day is that a senior police chief has warned unregulated education and home schooling could be a breeding ground for terrorism.\nThe Guardian leads on the US claim that North Korea is “begging for war” – the same line as the online Independent. The Telegraph splashes with Oxford’s vice-chancellor attacking “mendacious” politicians for accusing universities of using rising tuition fees to subsidise pay. Also on universities, the Times reports that cybercriminals are launching multiple attacks on institutions every year targeting medical and engineering departments dealing with missile technology.\nSign up\nIf you would like to receive the Guardian Morning Briefing by email, bright and early every weekday, sign up here.\n",

        "date": "2016-07-14T23:01:24Z",
        "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/jul/15/mps-decry-inadequate-efforts-stop-money-laundering-uk-property",
        "text": "\nGovernment attempts to stop the UK property market being exploited by international money launderers are “totally inadequate” and the country has instead “laid out a welcome mat” to criminals, the House of Commons home affairs committee has said.\nThe influential panel of MPs, chaired by the Labour backbencher Keith Vaz, said it was disgraceful that at least £100bn was being laundered through the UK every year and astonishing that just 335 out of 1.2m property transactions last year were deemed to be suspicious by law enforcement officials.\nThat means only 0.01% of the 2.4 million buyers and sellers in the UK generated suspicious activity reports at the National Crime Agency (NCA), whose system, Vaz said, was not fit for purpose.\n“The proceeds of crime legislation has failed,” Vaz said. “London is a centre for money laundering, and its standing as a global financial centre is dependent on proactively and effectively tackling money laundering. Investment in London properties is a major route which tarnishes the image of the capital. Supervision of the property market is totally inadequate.”\nThe NCA’s system gathers suspicious activity reports from lawyers, accountants, bankers and other professionals but is overwhelmed with more than 380,000 reports per year, when it is designed to handle 20,000.\n\n\n\n\nRevealed: 9% rise in London properties owned by offshore firms\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimates of the annual volume of ill-gotten gains laundered through the UK vary enormously. Vaz took his £100bn figure from the charity Transparency International but the report also cites evidence from Donald Toon, director of the economic crime command at the NCA, that it was likely to be “hundreds of millions of dollars”.\nLast year, Toon claimed the London property market had been skewed by laundered money and that prices were being artificially driven up by overseas criminals who wanted to sequester assets in the UK.\nThe MPs said it remained “far too easy for someone intent on laundering money to buy a property with their ill-gotten gains, and rent it out in a very buoyant and robust letting market and take in clean money in perpetuity”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Keith Vaz said the NCA’s system was a ‘futile and impotent weapon in the fight against criminal financing’. Photograph: Bruce Adams/Associated Newsp/Rex\n\n\nThe committee said letting agents must start undertaking appropriate due diligence on clients and making reports to the NCA’s suspicious activity reporting regime. \nVaz said the NCA’s system was so overburdened that it was “a futile and impotent weapon in the global fight against criminal financing, with no indication from the Home Office as to when a new state-of-the-art system will be purchased”.\nAn NCA spokesman confirmed the current system was “not effective or efficient” and said the agency was waiting for the conclusion of a Home Office review of the suspicious activity reporting system before deciding how to update it.\nThe stark criticisms come despite several recent commitments from government to clamp down on London being used to launder corrupt money from around the world. In May, David Cameron announced plans to require all foreign companies buying property in the UK to disclose their true owners in a public register for the first time. \nHe said: “We know that some high-value properties, especially in London, are being bought by people overseas through anonymous shell companies, using plundered or laundered cash.”\n\n\n\n\nHSBC escaped US money-laundering charges after Osborne's intervention\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore the change of prime minister and cabinet reshuffle, the chancellor, George Osborne, had told MPs that primary legislation to introduce the register was planned for after May 2017. \nIn April, the then home secretary, Theresa May, launched a new “action plan for anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist finance”. It set out to increase police capabilities to disrupt criminals and terrorists, reform the supervision of companies so that those that facilitated money laundering were tackled, and to extend the reach of law enforcement agencies and increase international co-operation.\nChido Dunn, an anti-corruption expert at the NGO Global Witness, said: “Dirty money in London’s luxury property market is endemic. This latest report reinforces how urgently action is needed to tackle the problem. Two months ago the government promised to introduce clear measures to do this. If these are swiftly enforced and fully resourced, they will go a long way to ensuring money launderers can’t find safe haven in the UK. The new government must treat this as a priority for the coming year, or we risk rolling out the red carpet to the corrupt and criminal.”\nA Home Office spokesman said: “We are committed to attacking criminal finances, making it harder to move, hide and use the proceeds of crime, as set out in the serious and organised crime strategy. \n“And there is clear evidence we are making progress in this effort: the government seized a total of £1.2bn from criminals between April 2010 and March 2016, with more assets recovered in 2015/16 than ever before.”\n",

        "text": "\nThe US government decided not to pursue criminal charges against HSBC for allowing terrorists and drug dealers to launder millions of dollars after George Osborne and the UK banking regulator intervened to warn that prosecuting Britain’s biggest bank could lead to a “global financial disaster”.\n\n\n\n\nGeorge Osborne reassures Wall Street: UK won't become 'Little Britain'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Monday, a congressional report published letters and emails from Osborne and Financial Services Authority (FSA) officials to their US counterparts warning that launching criminal action against HSBC in 2012 could have sparked a “financial calamity”. \nThe House financial services committee report said the UK interventions “played a significant role in ultimately persuading the DoJ [Department of Justice] not to prosecute HSBC”. Instead of pursuing a prosecution, the bank agreed to pay a record $1.92bn (£1.4bn) fine.\nThe report revealed that Osborne wrote to Ben Bernanke, who was then the Federal Reserve chairman, and Timothy Geithner, the then treasury secretary, to warn that prosecuting a “systemically important financial institution” like HSBC “could lead to [financial] contagion” and pose “very serious implications for financial and economic stability, particularly in Europe and Asia”.\nThe report said the FSA was “problematic”, “weighed in very strongly” and caused a “firestorm”, which led the then attorney general, Eric Holder, to overrule the advice of his own prosecutors and not pursue criminal action. \n“FSA has been on the phone for the criminal discussions,” officials wrote in emails released in the House report. “That’s what has caused the latest firestorm. The contents of that discussion are included in the Chancellor’s letter.”\nIf HSBC had been found guilty of the potential charges, the US government would have been required to review and possibly revoke its charter to do business in the US. The FSA repeatedly warned that even the threat of possible charter withdrawal could have caused a fresh global financial crisis.\nThe House report said Holder “misled” Congress about the justice department’s reasoning for declining to prosecute. It said the department had enough evidence to pursue criminal charges against HSBC and pointed out that the bank had already admitted to the US government that it broke money laundering rules.\nThe report said: “Rather than lacking adequate evidence to prove HSBC’s criminal conduct, internal treasury documents show that DoJ leadership declined to pursue [its legal team’s] recommendation to prosecute HSBC because senior DoJ leaders were concerned that prosecuting the bank ‘could result in a global financial disaster’– as the FSA repeatedly warned.”\nThe 2012 settlement detailed how Mexico’s Sinaloa drug cartel and Colombia’s Norte del Valle cartel laundered $881m through HSBC and a Mexican unit. In some cases, Mexican branches had widened tellers’ windows to allow big boxes of cash to be pushed across the counters.\nHSBC also violated US sanctions by working with customers in Iran, Libya, Sudan, Burma and Cuba.\nHSBC, the justice department and the US treasury declined to comment on the report. \n",

        "text": "\nIf I drive above the speed limit, I may be fined. I may lose my licence, and therefore my job. If I kill someone while speeding, I’m liable to go to jail. In weasel terms, I’m “accountable” or “responsible” for my driving. The Commonwealth Bank money laundering mess raises this question: are its directors legally responsible?\nWe talk in a legal vacuum. The law says that a company’s business is to be managed by or under the direction of its directors – but we talk as if the CEO is responsible instead. That’s wrong. Directors can delegate powers – they cannot devolve responsibility. The CEO is responsible to the board; the board is responsible to shareholders. But armed with a convenient legal fallacy, the directors try to duck for cover.\n\n\n\n\nCommonwealth Bank CEO Ian Narev to step aside by July 2018, chairman says\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe banks say their problems are “cultural” and the law can’t fix cultures. What nonsense! What if there is a “culture” of greed driven by remuneration schemes put there by the board? What if a macho culture drives men to intimidate women? Is the law then powerless?\nNo, the directors of CBA are accountable for all this mess – and here it’s strike three. Two generations ago, directors would have been pushed to resign. But that was when bank managers mowed their nature-strips on Sunday arvos. Now we do not respect the City, and it’s left to the regulator to tap the directors’ sense of decency. Their licences may not be presently at risk, but if Asic pursues the matter, might the court be asked to rule on their legal responsibility? \nThe directors relied on management. In court, they would have to show they made independent assessments of the executives’ advice. This law is hard. How many of the CBA directors knew enough about banking to assess independently what their management were saying? Did the directors reasonably believe that their powers were always being properly exercised? \nHere is the Volkswagen dilemma. Either the directors knew what was going on or they didn’t. The malefactors were either working under the directors’ direction or they weren’t. Which is worse? If the law enforcement agencies were telling CBA that something was wrong, can the directors now say that they thought everything was OK? Weren’t they at least put on notice? Win, lose, or draw, should we not spend some taxes putting these directors in the witness box so that they can explain to us just what they do for their money? \nIf you watch The Big Short at the cinema, you will hear groans of resignation at the end – nothing happened to the decision makers. Big corporates never get to face our justice system. Two teams of ineffably urbane lawyers stitch together an evasive dissemblance of regret – apologies are so demeaning; the corporation pays an agreed sum to government; the shareholders take the hit; and the executives collect their bonuses and move on to the next fatted calf. \nIan Narev has given notice of his resignation. Some executives have lost bonuses north of a million dollars. That’s more than 10 times what we pay high school teachers. That will have hurt them less than a speeding fine hurts me – and their licence to act as directors hasn’t been at risk.  \nVery few directors faced cross-examination over the global financial crisis. We protect them like we protect koala bears. Company directors’ status appears to put them outside the law. This apparent privilege deeply upsets the punters. Our justice system really works over those at the bottom – but we don’t lay a finger on those on high. Are these koalas, then, untouchable? More invulnerable even than cardinals?\n\n\n\n\nComm Bank scandal: what happens when too much power is placed in too few hands | Tom Westland\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis class difference is cancerous. We should all have the same legal rights. But, then, this company pays its CEO more than 100 times what it pays its tellers. Do you see why inequality – in both money and status – is such a loaded word now?\nWe have a prime minister reduced to grinning through defeat after defeat;  a government that gets everything wrong by either instinct or tradition, and that just ignores us; and a business world that is indolent and protected at the top, greedy in the middle, and deprived and angry down below. Those are precisely the forces that generate a sense of caste and that gave us Farage, Hanson, and Trump.\nThey also make the case for a full inquiry into our banks unanswerable.\n Warren Buffett manages differently. A scandal at American Express left subsidiaries owing $60m. Should the parent voluntarily honour those debts? Buffett said their business depended on trust. We hear that truism a lot now, but Buffett paid the debts to set “standards of financial integrity and responsibility ... beyond those of the normal commercial enterprise.” For Buffett, it was not enough just to comply with the law; the CBA can’t even manage that.\nAnd what happened to the good old bank set up to guard our common wealth?\n",

        "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/04/trump-russia-steve-bannon-book-robert-mueller",
        "text": "\nOne of the many telling vignettes in Michael Wolff’s book is the sight of Steve Bannon, then White House chief strategist, pacing the West Wing, openly dispensing odds on Donald Trump’s chances of surviving in office.\n\n\n\n\nTrump lawyers try to halt book's release as White House fights to contain firestorm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBannon gave Trump a probability of a third that he might limp to the finish line because of Democratic incompetence; a third that he would be pushed from office under the 25th amendment on grounds of mental incapability; and a third that he would be impeached.\nThat a man who was for many months Trump’s right-hand man would brazenly give out such doom-laden predictions is remarkable enough. But letting the world know of it via Wolff could make it a self-fulfilling prophecy.\nThe most explosive aspect of Bannon’s take, revealed by Fire and Fury, is Trump’s handling – or rather mishandling – of the Russia investigation that rages around him. Assuming Wolff’s account to be accurate (and Bannon has said nothing so far to suggest otherwise) the former chief strategist considered Trump entirely out of his depth with regard to special counsel Robert Mueller’s inquiry into possible links between Russia and the Trump team.\nOn a practical level, Trump did not have the “discipline to navigate a tough investigation”, Wolff writes, nor the savvy to bring on powerful lawyers. Most seriously, Trump was, in Bannon’s estimation, unable to grasp “how much Mueller had on him and his family”.\n“He doesn’t necessarily see what’s coming,” Bannon is quoted as saying.\nWe now know from the Guardian’s account of excerpts of the book that Bannon believes the June 2016 meeting between Trump’s son and Russians bearing promises of dirt on Hillary Clinton to have been “treasonous”. We also know that Bannon puts the chances of Donald Jr failing to have informed his father of the encounter at “zero”.\nThat is not evidence that would satisfy as meticulous a prosecutor as Mueller, but it does shift the frame of the Russia inquiry. Trump may try to belittle Bannon’s involvement with his campaign and subsequent time in the White House, scoffing that he had “little to do with our historic victory”, but few will buy that.\n“Bannon was an insider in the campaign at the highest level, and in the White House all the way to last August,” said Richard Painter, chief White House ethics lawyer under George W Bush. “He was talking to the president constantly – I can’t imagine Trump not confiding in him, including over the Russia inquiry.”\nThat in turn raises the possibility that Bannon might cooperate. Certainly, there is no love lost between him and Trump family members, notably the president’s son-in-law Jared Kushner.\n“Bannon may already be cooperating with Mueller for all we know,” Painter said. “He has no incentive to cover up for Trump, or his family members.”\n\n\n \n\n\nPlay Video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1:18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Fire and Fury: Key explosive quotes from the new Trump book - video\n\n\nAll of which increases the significance of Bannon’s interpretation of the Russia investigation as it reaches possibly critical stages. Where he places his focus is clear from the book: the financial doings of Trump and his immediate family.\nWhen Trump gave an interview to the New York Times last July in which he warned Mueller not to delve into his family’s finances, Bannon’s response was scathing. Wolff writes: “‘Ehhh … ehhh … ehhh!’ screeched Bannon, making the sound of an emergency alarm. ‘Don’t look here! Let’s tell a prosecutor what not to look at!’”\nBannon is specific about what he regards as the most dangerous aspect of the Mueller inquiry: “It goes through Deutsche Bank and all the Kushner shit. The Kushner shit is greasy. They’re going to go right through that.”\nLast month it was revealed that federal prosecutors are looking into Kushner’s ties to Deutsche Bank. Those ties include the $285m borrowed from a bank which has been implicated in Russian money-laundering scandals to refinance his holding of part of the old New York Times building in Manhattan. Last July, the Guardian disclosed that Kushner bought the property from a Soviet-born oligarch whose company was named in a high-profile New York money-laundering case.\n“Watch Kushner” and “watch Deutsche Bank” seem to be two of the takeaways from this extraordinary chapter in an exceptional presidency. \n\n\n\n\nJared Kushner sealed real estate deal with oligarch's firm cited in money-laundering case\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe book also gives an account of events on board Air Force One, in which a misleading public statement was prepared to explain the Don Jr meeting in Trump Tower with the Russians.\nAs was previously known, Trump took control of the statement, insisting the meeting was exclusively about the adoption of Russian children. In fact, the Russian contingent offered incriminating intelligence on Clinton, a crucial detail that was not mentioned but which became quickly public after the email chain involving Don Jr was released.\nWolff gives a more complete rendition, again assuming the accuracy of his account. He writes that the entire White House communications team was relegated to the back of the plane while Trump was up front composing a public statement that could be construed as an attempted cover-up, exposing the president to legal peril.\n“It used to hurt my feelings when I saw them running around doing things that were my job,” Sean Spicer, the then White House director of communications, is quoted as saying. “Now I’m glad to be out of the loop.”\nThe person who remained in the loop was Hope Hicks, currently a successor of Spicer’s as communications chief.\nBannon is said by Wolff to have seen Hicks as “nothing more than a hapless presidential enabler” and flunky for “Jarvanka” – Kushner and his wife, Trump’s daughter Ivanka.\nIn the fallout from the Trump Tower meeting and false statement, Wolff reports a fight between Bannon and Hicks in the cabinet room. “You don’t know what you are doing,” Bannon is said to have shouted. “You don’t know how much trouble you are in … You are as dumb as a stone!”\nThe pair, Wolff writes, never spoke to each other again.\n",

        "text": "\nA former aide to Nigel Farage who was arrested on money-laundering charges last year gave US federal agents “information” as part of a plea agreement that sharply reduced his possible prison sentence from a maximum of 20 years to eight months, according to court documents.\n George Cottrell, a Briton who was arrested in the US last summer after attending the Republican National Convention with Farage, the former Ukip leader, received a sentence that was on the low end of the sentencing guidelines used to determine such cases even though the Arizona prosecutors in his case said they had evidence that showed Cottrell had shown “clear intent” to engage in criminal activity in the past.\nA court document filed by the prosecutors in February – which has not previously been reported in detail – advised the judge in the case to offer Cottrell a light prison sentence because he had been willing to “provide federal agents additional information after his arrest”. \n\n\n\n\nNigel Farage ex-aide facing jail after admitting posing as money launderer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCottrell ultimately pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud in a case that was unrelated to his work at Ukip. The crime was committed in 2014, before Cottrell worked for either the anti-EU party or Farage. Twenty other counts against him, including blackmail, were dismissed as part of the plea deal. \nThe nature of the information Cottrell provided to federal agents is not spelled out in the court documents. But the documents state that the 23-year-old, who is living in the UK, provided federal agents with “additional information about his role in the offence and how he became involved”. It also suggests he could be called to testify about his statements in the future and that additional information about the plea may be under seal and unavailable to the public.\nCottrell was reached by the Guardian but declined to comment on the information he provided or questions about his previous work for Farage and Ukip. \nUnder the terms of his agreement with prosecutors, Cottrell admitted to communicating with individuals online in 2014 who were seeking to launder illicit funds. He also admitted that he had explained methods to them that they could use to launder the money. The case involved a sting operation in which federal agents posed as drug dealers. Cottrell met the undercover agents in Las Vegas in 2014, according to the original indictment, but the charges in connection with that meeting were dropped. \nProsecutors said Cottrell also deserved leniency because he promptly agreed to plead guilty on the wire fraud charge and had accepted responsibility for his actions. They also noted that he did not have a criminal record. An attorney who represented Cottrell did not return calls for comment.\nThe dramatic arrest occurred at O’Hare airport in Chicago on 22 July, just as Cottrell, who was travelling with Farage, was leaving the US for the UK after attending the Republican National Convention in Ohio.\nHis mobile phone and laptop were seized after the arrest. \nCottrell had been working in Farage’s office and claimed on his LinkedIn account to have co-directed Ukip’s EU referendum campaign fundraising. \nMedia accounts at the time described Cottrell as a familiar face on Farage’s campaign bus ahead of the EU referendum.\nAfter the arrest, Farage called Cottrell a “22-year-old unpaid volunteer and party supporter” and said he knew nothing of the “series of allegations” that had been lodged against him.\nAccording to court records that delved into the 2014 episode, Cottrell offered to help the undercover agents – who were posing as drug dealers – to disguise their drug profits and evade federal taxes. Prosecutors also alleged that Cottrell claimed to have contacts at banks that he could use to funnel illicit money to offshore accounts and then transfer them back to domestic accounts disguised as legitimate business income. Prosecutors said in court documents that the agents were “impressed with his knowledge of finance, US government procedures, and anti-money-laundering laws”.\nHe was released from prison in March after agreeing the plea deal and was deported from the US, according to court records.\nSeveral photographs published by media outlets after the arrest in July, when Cottrell’s story was front page news in the British press, showed that Cottrell had enjoyed a personal relationship with Farage and the Ukip donor Arron Banks. In his book about the Brexit campaign, Banks called Cottrell, the nephew of Lord Hesketh, a former Tory minister who defected to Ukip, “Posh George”.\n“Posh to the point of caricature and wilfully abrasive, but extremely generous when it comes to picking up the bar tab,” Banks wrote.\nAt the time of his final court appearance in March, the judge in his case, Diane Humetewa, described Cottrell as having lived a “very privileged life”.\nTwenty counts against Cottrell were dropped in the plea deal, including a conspiracy charge. Under the new charge, Humetewa said Cottrell was facing a possible sentence of eight to 14 months. She accepted prosecutors’ recommendation of the lowest possible sentence. \nCottrell, who apologised for wrongdoing, suggested he had turned to crime after suffering from a multimillion-dollar gambling addiction that had caused him to be disinherited. His attorney, Michael Kimerer, described the fraud as a single aberrant, abnormal and huge mistake, and said Cottrell had been a law-abiding citizen since that period in 2014, and that he had become involved in politics, which he enjoyed.\nThe prosecutor in the case, James Knapp, said of Cottrell’s guilty plea: “We do see this as being a significant crime in that the dark web can be a hotbed of criminal activity, and, you know, the use of anonymity and encryption and all of that makes it very difficult to catch people.”\nHe added: “But, on the other hand, we fully recognise that there are some mitigating circumstances in this defendant, and we wish him the best of luck in the future and hope that we never see him again in this context.”\nThe final plea concluded that investigators were ultimately unable to confirm whether Cottrell really was a professional money launderer who had committed crimes before the one to which he pleaded guilty, but that he had the experience given previous work in the financial industry, and the “predisposition”, given his use of dark web marketing, to commit crime.\nCottrell’s LinkedIn account reveals that he has experience in the financial sector. He includes being a “federal inmate” on his LinkedIn resume, as well as working as a consultant at an unnamed private intelligence agency serving government and corporate clients. He allegedly worked for the intelligence firm from October 2014 to July 2016, while also working for Ukip from January 2016 until his arrest.\nHe also claims to have worked as a private client manager at an unnamed bank, specialised in “onboarding” wealthy clients and assisting in the implementation of “leading edge tax solutions within multiple jurisdictions”. He also allegedly worked as a junior adviser at Cayman fund and as a board adviser for a “private family office” in London. \n",

        "text": "\nAustralia’s corporate watchdog is investigating whether the country’s biggest bank broke disclosure laws by not telling investors about problems with money laundering by criminal gangs and suspected terrorists.\nThe Australian Securities and Investments Commission chairman, Greg Medcraft, told MPs on Friday that the investigation would determine whether the Commonwealth Bank met its licensing obligations to “act efficiently, honestly and fairly” in revealing potential costs to the bank.\n\n\n\n\nCommonwealth Bank CEO confident internal warnings not 'wilfully ignored'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking atthe same parliamentary committee hearings in Sydney, the Reserve Bank governor, Philip Lowe, said that the banking sector in general had “strained” public trust with its pursuit of profit over customer service.\nThe problem of criminal gangs exploiting a lack of safeguards around “intelligent deposit machines” to launder tens of millions of dollars was raised at Commonwealth’s highest levels around August 2015.\nBut the first investors knew of it was when a federal court lawsuit dropped last week alleging “systemic and serious” violations of anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism funding laws since 2012.\nThe lawsuit by Austrac, the financial intelligence agency, could become the most expensive in Australian corporate history.\nAustrac secured the largest fine against the gambling company Tabcorp in March over 108 breaches of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act.\nThe Commonwealth Bank is accused of more than 43,700 breaches of the same laws, raising the unlikley possibility of a maximum fine of $9.66bn, almost as much as its record $9.88bn net cash profit last financial year.\nThe Commonwealth’s chief executive, Ian Narev, Australia’s highest paid bank boss with $12.3m in 2015-16, has defended the lack of disclosure to investors. He did not believe that a costly lawsuit would follow.\nMedcraft said that Asic would examine whether the bank’s officers and directors met their disclosure duties under the Corporations Act.\n“I wanted to inform the committee that ASIC has commenced inquiries into this matter and any consequences this matter has for the laws we administer,” he said.\nMedcraft said companies did not have to tell Asic about breaches of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act.\nBut directors needed to “bring professional scepticism in exercising their role” to make sure risks were managed, he said.\nLowe told the parliamentary house economics committee that it was “fair to say that trust in banking has been strained” and that service had taken a back seat to sales in the industry.\nWhile generally managing risks satisfactorily, there were examples of this being neglected because of a desire for short-term profit, Lowe said.\nNarev suggested on Wednesday the bank hierarchy had no reason to believe it could face major penalties when in 2015, it disclosed more than 43,000 late reports of big transactions to Austrac.\nThat came amid alleged delays or a failure to act on police requests to stop suspicious overseas transfers, and for information, which led to an Australian federal police raid of the bank’s premises in Perth over a $315m methamphetamine investigation.\nNarev said notices from regulators were “normally a very specific request for a piece of information” and the bank reported about 4m suspicious transactions to Austrac a year.\n“When you get these sorts of notices from Austrac, they are not against any expressed view of what they’re going to be used for and what the outcome might come for,” Narev said.\n“We do what we always do in these situations, is exercise judgment as to what requires disclosure against pretty well-established principles about what requires disclosure, and our view would be that these things didn’t come anywhere near it in the form they came at the time.”\nNarev was also asked asked whether the bank’s alleged delays or lack of action on suspected criminal cashflows despite requests from the Australian federal police and others were due to its interest in collecting fees from more than $8bn that went through its machines.\nHe said there were “no economic reasons that would underpin the alleged activity and that’s not part of the equation”.\nOn Thursday the federal treasurer, Scott Morrison, condemned the bank’s “epic fail” over the money laundering allegations after taking advice from Asic and the banks’ watchdog, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority. \nMorrison told ABC radio on Thursday there were “very troubling” issues of culture and governance at the bank. It previously had to pay out tens of millions to compensate customers for poor financial advice, and was tarnished by revelations of profit-driven denials of life insurance claims.\n",

        "text": "\nIt is generally considered poor taste to kick someone while they’re down. In the case of Commonwealth Bank CEO Ian Narev, I think an exception can and should be made. Narev is the extraordinarily well-paid executive of an extraordinarily profitable bank that has this week been accused of having forgotten – on 53,506 separate occasions – to notify regulators of large cash transactions.\nThe bank was required to make these notifications by law; apparently a computer coding error prevented CBA from doing so. This cock-up, regulators allege, meant that criminal syndicates were able to feed large amounts of dirty cash into the bank’s ATMs anonymously and deposit it, suitably laundered, into offshore accounts. \n\n\n\n\nCommonwealth Bank unmasked: why the government is suing over alleged terrorism trail – explainer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bank is currently retailing the idea that although they broke the law 50,000 times, since there was only one coding error, there was only one violation, with one relatively small fine. I hope there is a separate financial penalty under the relevant legislation just for the chutzpah.\nNarev, for his part, is shocked – shocked – to discover that gambling was going on in his establishment. He has said, in the euphemistic language spoken natively only by banking executives, sporting coaches and management consultants, that he isn’t spending any time “contemplating his future”: he’s focused on “doing his job”. \nWhat, though, does his job entail, if not preventing this kind of thing? The money laundering business, we are supposed to believe, is the kind of mishap that could happen to any CEO. No doubt he also resents being blamed for the CBA’s financial planning scandal (which, to be fair, largely predated Narev’s tenure, though he was there for bank’s tardy response) and other sundry disasters that have befallen the bank in the six years since he took the top job.\nAnd in a way, it is unfair to blame him for everything that has gone wrong during his time at the wheel. The Commonwealth Bank is a large institution with a truly enormous balance sheet, and no human being could be expected to supervise every aspect of its operations. The problem is that while the CBA board does not require Narev to be omniscient, they pay him as though he was: in 2016 alone, he received over $12m. This is many multiples of the salary of the manager of the CBA’s Leichhardt branch, who tried to raise the alarm over a series of questionable deposits in 2015, to no effect. And which of the two has behaved more in the bank’s long term interest?\nWhile this scandal raises a great many questions – about corporate governance, about the enforcement of financial regulation, and about the internal culture of the Commonwealth Bank – it’s worth considering what the implications are for the ongoing debate in this country about income inequality.\nIt’s often said that paying top executives very high salaries is a reward for their talent. In big firms like banks, however, this is ludicrously unrealistic. For one thing, executives have substantial bargaining power. Finding a new CEO is costly for a bank, and firing an existing executive is bad for its reputation. This gives the executive leverage in negotiating higher pay. This dynamic not only leads to oversized bonuses and rising inequality, it may also not be very good for business in the long term, either. High pay for bank bosses can also encourage them to make poor long-term investment choices that look good in the short or medium term, as well as to discourage subordinates who don’t face the same financial incentives.\nMore generally, this scandal raises questions about power, and about the cult of the “leader” that has become increasingly dominant in Australia’s economy and, more broadly, its society. We blame football captains for their team’s poor performance; we attribute a political party’s strong polls to its leader and, when things go south, we naturally wonder when they’ll be rolled by their party room. Leaders are complicit in overstating their importance, obviously, but there’s no reason that the rest of us should buy into their own mythology – or, like CBA shareholders and customers, be forced to pay for it.\n\n\n\n\nInequality is real - and guess what? The electorate has noticed | Van Badham\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cult of the leader is a natural consequence of the way in which our economy is organised. In theory, in a free-market economy, information flows from disparate sources towards people with power, helping them to make informed decisions. However, as the philosopher Elizabeth Anderson points out in a provocative new book, large corporations look much more like Stalinist command economies than the idealised world of independent artisans that Adam Smith envisioned. \nAs a result, conscientious workers like the Leichhardt branch manager find that they have little influence in a top-heavy organisational system that is almost designed to tolerate or overlook bad behaviour. And you can be sure that if the CBA is fined for each violation, it will be the conscientious workers who suffer: Narev may have been fired by then, but I can guarantee you he’ll be living fairly comfortably.\nIn the case of the CBA, it is clear that lower-level employees in the bank knew more about what was going on – or, at least, were more proactive about raising their concerns – than their superiors were. If they had been listened to, then the bank might have avoided the potential $1tn fine it could now face. The Commonwealth Bank, therefore, could serve as a metaphor for an economy that places too much wealth and too much power in the hands of too few people. Not only is this inequality unfair – it’s also dangerous.\n",

        "text": "\nRoyal Bank of Scotland is considering using Amsterdam as its post-Brexit EU hub and has revealed it is being investigated for potential breaches of money laundering rules.\nThe the 71% taxpayer-owned bank made the announcements as it reported its first half-year profit for three years. The £939m profit compares with a £2bn loss a year ago, although the chief executive, Ross McEwan, warned a full-year loss was likely, which would be the 10th consecutive year of annual losses since its 2008 bailout.\nThe bank signalled that more jobs could be cut on top of the 14,200 – about 15% of the workforce – which have gone in the last 12 months. These job losses reduced costs which helped boost profits, as did a better performance at its investment banking business, NatWest Market.\nThe Amsterdam office is for the NatWest Markets arm, and advanced discussions are under way with the Dutch national bank. RBS already holds a banking licence in the Netherlands – a legacy of its takeover of the Dutch bank ABN Amro – and needs to beef up its presence there to “minimise disruption to the business” after Brexit.\nThe operation could need 150 people, RBS said, although it may not be necessary to move all staff from London. The cost of setting up the hub will be in the “tens of millions”.\nMeanwhile, the news of the investigation into potential breaches of money laundering rules was contained in the more than 15 pages of legal warnings attached to the results. \n“On 21 July 2017, the FCA [Financial Conduct Authority] notified RBS that it is undertaking an investigation into RBS plc’s compliance with the money laundering regulations 2007 in relation to certain customers. RBS is cooperating with the investigation,” the bank said, without providing further details.\nThere was a separate disclosure about a previously announced investigation into allegations that Britain’s banks processed vast amounts of tainted money from Russian criminals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  The RBS chief executive, Ross McEwan, said the bank had resolved some of the most significant issues it faced. Photograph: Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images\n\n\n \n But McEwan said: “Our path to sustainable profitability is becoming clearer and closer and we have resolved some of the most significant issues this bank faced.”\nHe added: “It does feel this business is seeing the light at the tunnel,” but said the one major outstanding issue was settlement with the US Department of Justice over the sale of toxic mortgage bonds a decade ago. He hopes for a resolution before the end of the year.\nSir Howard Davies, the bank’s chairman, is among senior figures in Brexit discussions with the government. Davies said there was now a recognition of the potential for “some quite serious consequences for London which could happen in a very rapid and unplanned way if we don’t get some transition agreements”.\nHe said the bank had just started to detect “signs of hesitancy” among corporate customers, especially manufacturers. “We’re seeing people sitting on their hands a bit,” he said. On Thursday, the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, said Brexit was starting to affect business decisions. \nBut McEwan said the results demonstrated a reason to own RBS shares, which is important if the chancellor, Philip Hammond, is to be able to sell off any more on top of the 5% stake sold in August 2015  at a £1bn loss.\n McEwan said the decision to sell was the government’s and Hammond has previously cited the DoJ settlement as an impediment to a sale but also signalled that the shares could be sold at a loss.\nThe Treasury repeated a statement that it would “continue to seek opportunities for disposals, but the need to resolve legacy issues makes it uncertain as to when these will occur.”\nIt added: “There is still work to do but RBS is continuing to implement its strategy and is making good progress in dealing with the problems of the past.”\nNicholas Hyett, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that until mistakes of the past were resolved “all the good work that RBS has done will continue to get lost in the noise”.\n“The core businesses are delivering steady income growth thanks to growing activity and costs look to be falling,” said Hyett.\nRBS shares closed at 261.2p, up 1.9% but still well below the average price per share of 502p during its bailout in 2008 and 2009.\n",

        "text": "\nFormer Argentinian president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner is the subject of a court investigation into large-scale international money laundering.\nFernández has not been formally charged with any wrongdoing, but federal prosecutor Guillermo Marijuán on Saturday “imputed” her. In Argentina’s legal system, that means the prosecutor feels there is enough evidence to warrant a full-scale investigation that could result in charges.The prosecutor moved against the still-popular former president after hearing 12 hours of testimony by Leonardo Fariña, an imprisoned former associate of businessman and alleged Fernández frontman Lázaro Báez.\nIn a plea bargain, Fariña implicated Fernández and her late husband and former president Nestor Kirchner in a case related to money laundering and embezzling funds earmarked for public works. Baez was arrested last week.\nAccording to press reports, Fariña testified to the movement out of Argentina by Fariña and Báez of tens and possibly hundreds of millions of dollars, money that was transferred through offshore companies in Panama, Belize and the Seyschelles to a Swiss bank.\nFernández, 63, is due to answer questions in court on Wednesday over a separate probe into the sale of US dollar futures contracts at below-market rates by the central bank during her administration. \nThe leftist leader, from the Peronist party, was barred constitutionally from seeking a third consecutive term. Opposition candidate Mauricio Macri won the November election, ending more than a decade of Peronist rule. \n",

        "text": "\nHSBC has been accused of “possible criminal complicity” in a money laundering scandal involving South Africa’s wealthy Gupta family.\nSpeaking in the House of Lords on Wednesday, two weeks after he first voiced concerns about UK links to the probe, Lord Hain said he had handed new evidence to the chancellor about the alleged involvement of a British bank in the “flagrant robbery” of South African taxpayers. Hain did not mention the name the bank in the Lords but did so in a letter to the Philip Hammond, in which he said the bank should be investigated over “possible criminal complicity” in corruption.\n\n\n\n\nLabour demands review into City of London role in money-laundering\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHain, a former anti-apartheid activist, had earlier written to Hammond, attaching printouts of bank transfers and asking him to pass them to the Serious Fraud Office (SFO), National Crime Agency (NCA) and Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). A Treasury spokesperson confirmed Hammond had asked the agencies to examine the transactions.\nThe Gupta corruption scandal began when the Indian-born family was accused of allegedly using its vast wealth to wield influence over South Africa’s president, Jacob Zuma. The Guptas and Zuma deny any wrongdoing. \nHain told the Lords he had obtained information that “shows illegal transfers of funds from South Africa made by the Gupta family over the last few years from their South African accounts to accounts held in Dubai and Hong Kong”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Lord Hain condemned ‘an iniquitous breach of legal banking practice’. Photograph: John Stillwell/PA\n\n\n“Many of the transactions are legitimate, but many certainly are not,” he said. “The latter illicit transactions were flagged internally as suspicious, but I am informed that they were told by the UK headquarters to ignore it.\n“That is an iniquitous breach of legal banking practice which I trust ministers would never countenance and is an incitement to money laundering, which has self-evidently occurred in this case, and also been sanctioned by a British bank, as part of the flagrant robbery of South African taxpayers of many millions.”\nHain said the transactions were disguised, originating from one bank account before being split in a number of different accounts.\nHe told the Lords: “Undoubtedly, hard questions will need to be asked of the facilitating banks, because they have aided and abetted the Gupta money laundering activities.”\nThe former Labour minister’s latest intervention comes two weeks after the chancellor referred concerns about Standard Chartered and HSBC to the FCA, SFO and NCA. He did so after Hain wrote to him saying high-level sources in South Africa had alerted him to the exposure of British financial institutions to the affair.\nStandard Chartered has since said that it closed bank accounts in 2014 because of concerns about potential links to the scandal.\nIn the Lords, Hain called on the chancellor to “ensure that such evident money laundering and illegality is not tolerated and that the bank is investigated for a possible criminal complicity over this matter.\n“Urgent action is needed to close down this network of corruption.”\nHSBC’s chief executive, Stuart Gulliver, said on Monday that the bank was “responding to those inquiries that have come in from the FCA and also from South African authorities, and there is nothing more I can really add at this point in time”.\nAn FCA spokesperson said it was in contact with both banks named and would “consider carefully further responses received”.\n",

        "text": "\nFifteen years ago a group of Kenyan churchgoers decided to tackle the growing problem of young beggars in their small coastal town. The children had been orphaned by HIV and extreme poverty prevented their extended families from offering them a home. The women founded a charity whose UK arm, Upendo UK, sends donations to feed, clothe and educate 56 of these children so that impoverished relatives can afford to take them in.\nIn February the project was jeopardised when the charity’s bank, HSBC, cut off its funding stream without warning. “We only discovered that our account had been closed, along with all the standing orders and direct debits, when a donor asked why their payment had been rejected,” says founder Jo Jenkins. “HSBC had requested extra information, which I provided, and I was assured that everything appeared to be in order, but they still went ahead anyway.”\nUpendo UK is one of several charities who have contacted The Observer to report that their banking facilities had suddenly been withdrawn. All appear to be casualties of the cut-throat market and tough anti-money laundering regulations following the financial crisis of 2008.\n\n\n\n\nWhich charity website should you use?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBanks, which face punitive fines from UK and US regulators if they fall foul of the rules, have been hastening to ditch accounts they fear might compromise them in a process known as “de-risking”. Companies and charities with links to countries deemed high risk are especially vulnerable. Since the highest-risk countries are often the most impoverished, the closures could prevent vital aid reaching the neediest recipients.\nA medical research institute, which seeks to improve specialist treatments in the poorest parts of the world, feared it could no longer operate after its accounts were suspended by HSBC. “We’ve become the latest victim,” says a spokesperson for the charity which wants to remain anonymous. “Our account has been indefinitely suspended because one of our board members is from Egypt, and we make money transfers to this and other countries deemed high risk. As a small charity this will likely force us into administration.”\nMeanwhile, a housing charity that supports homeless young women in London faced extinction after being told its bank account would be terminated. It too prefers not to be named. “We run a low-level operation and have had our accounts with the same bank since our inception 25 years ago,” says its director. “I can think of no reason why we might have offended the bank, other than this being an excuse to rid themselves of businesses they no longer feel benefit them.”\nHSBC reinstated the accounts of the 52-year-old anti-fascism campaign and research group Searchlight last November, only after The Observer intervened. It had closed them without explanation following a review.\nLast year the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) warned of an “avalanche” of de-risking which could close thousands of accounts. Its report found that small charities were among customers at greatest risk of being ousted, along with foundations and cultural associations catering for certain ethnic groups.\nOne unnamed bank was discovered to have closed 59 charity accounts for suspected non compliance in 2014 and some charities had been forced to pay thousands of pounds on legal advice to safeguard their banking facilities.\nThe report warned that lives might be put at risk if charitable spending was restricted in vulnerable countries. “We are not talking here about the freedom to give money directly to known terrorists, but the ability to distribute aid money using local systems which may inevitably pass through areas controlled by terrorists,” it says. “We are also talking about maintaining aid flows to areas where the recipients may resort, out of desperation, to aggressive measures against aid staff.”\nThe FCA’s report came in the wake of the government’s national risk assessment of money laundering and terrorist financing which concluded that despite proven abuse being rare, the terrorist financing risks within the charitable sector are deemed “medium-high”.\n\n\n\n\nAre overseas charity challenges just a jolly for all concerned?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut according to the Charities Aid Foundation (CAF), which provides banking and fundraising services to 1,250 charities, “de-risking” could end up encouraging the sort of crime it’s designed to prevent. “Charities play an essential role in providing aid and building stability in vulnerable countries. Compromising that stability by cutting off aid could increase the risk of terrorism,” says Hannah Terry, head of policy and campaigns at CAF, which has tried in vain to establish how many charities have been denied access to banking services.\n“The reality for banks is that they have been in a very difficult position since 9/11 [when the US cracked down on potential terrorism funding],” says Terry. “They are being asked to police the contours of international crime without a rule book and the potential risk of banks getting it wrong is huge. It takes investment in compliance and due diligence to cater for customers with riskier links and we want more clarity on the regulations.”\nThe British Bankers’ Association is also calling for regulations to be reformed to allow humanitarian aid to reach countries deemed risky by the government without exposing banks to the prospect of punitive fines.\nHSBC reinstated the accounts of Upendo UK and the medical research institute after The Observer intervened, while the homeless charity has been given a reprieve by its bank. Upendo UK was offered £300 in compensation but says it is trying to recoup more than £2,000-worth of cancelled standing orders.\n“We aspire to set the industry standard for knowing our customers and detecting, deterring and protecting against financial crime,” says HSBC. “This includes asking existing customers to provide additional information about themselves and the intended nature of their business with HSBC. Where a customer doesn’t supply all of the information, HSBC may be forced to restrict their services. A decision of this kind is never taken lightly and we will continue to work with the government and industry bodies to support the not-for-profit sector and to help charity customers manage risk in their operations.”\nThe four charities in question insist they provided all the requested information, but that once the prospect of account closure had been raised, bank staff seemed powerless to prevent it.\n“The most troubling aspect has been the evasive nature of the review team,” says the director of the homeless charity, which was served a notice of closure because the bank claimed it had provided insufficient information despite the fact it had submitted to three telephone interviews.\n“You cannot speak by phone, you have to book an appointment days in advance with another department which then tells you that any decision rests with yet another department of which we are not allowed to know the manager. When I complained, I was given shopping vouchers because mistakes had been made, but was told that the complaints team could not remove the notice of closure. A lot of what I experienced was poor management and incompetence, as well as suspicion of us funding Isis.”\nWHY CHARITIES GET CAUGHT OUT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Banks are monitoring money laundering. Photograph: Alamy\n\n\nMoney laundering is the exchanging of money or assets that were obtained criminally for money or assets that are legitimate. The legitimate money or assets don’t have an obvious link with any criminal activity. Money laundering also includes money that is used to fund terrorism, however it’s obtained.\nBanks are obliged under the Money Laundering Regulations to monitor customers for suspected criminal activity and to perform risk assessments.\nGiven that banks are free to chose who they want to do business with, there is a chance they will decide that a charity with links to certain countries is too risky. Charities can help safeguard themselves by identifying and recording who donates what, and how and why.\n",

        "text": "\n \nPolice have searched the headquarters of Santander Bank in Madrid after suspicions were raised that the bank was linked to money laundering and tax evasion on the part of some of its clients.\nActing on orders of high court judge José de la Mata, agents of the central operative unit of the Guardia Civil began searching the bank’s offices in Boadilla del Monte in central Spain on Friday morning for information about specific accounts.\n Santander issued a statement saying it had “received a request for information about the movements of certain accounts between different entities”. It added that it was collaborating with the authorities and “supplying all the available information”.\n The case involves the continuing investigation into the Falciani list of accounts from HSBC’s Swiss private bank in Geneva, leaked by IT worker Hervé Falciani in 2008. The list included the names of some 130,000 suspected tax evaders, 659 of whom were Spanish. The Spanish tax office believes that as much as €6bn was concealed in these 659 accounts.\n\n\n\n\nHSBC files: amnesty deal for Swiss bank's Spanish clients investigated\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n A large number of the 659 people named regularised their affairs with the taxman but several decided to fight in the courts on the grounds that Falciani had obtained the information illegally and it was therefore not admissible as evidence.\nDe la Mata has been investigating whether HSBC helped clients to conceal and launder money from illicit gains. Sources close to the case say that 40 “individuals or family groups” are under investigation. All 40 are said to have appeared on Falciani’s list.\nA tax inspectors’ report says that “there are indications that HSBC, either through its offices in Switzerland or its branches in Spain or third countries, offered Spanish residents the possibility of placing substantial sums of money in opaque accounts”.\n Emilio Botín, then chief executive of Santander, was the most prominent Spanish name on Falciani’s list, along with several members of his family. The Botín family has run the bank since 1909. Botín made a €200m settlement with the Spanish tax agency, which represented 10% of the sum involved, but tax evasion charges were dropped after he made the settlement. His daughter Ana Patricia became CEO when he died in 2014 – she previously ran Santander in the UK.\n",

        "text": "\nOn a bright May morning two years ago, the world was shocked by pictures of top officials of Fifa, the international football federation, being herded away from the luxury Hotel Baur au Lac in Zurich by Swiss police officers, sheltered from the waiting media by hotel staff holding up crisp white bedsheets. The early morning raid and arrests were based on indictments that followed an investigation by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation into corruption in football, an investigation built around the plea-bargained testimony of Chuck Blazer, who has died aged 72 after suffering from cancer.\nBlazer, a portly figure with a Santa Claus beard and Harpo Marx haircut, worked his way up from the grassroots of US soccer into the very heart of power in world football. As executive vice-president of the United States Soccer Federation (USSF, or US Soccer), and then general secretary of Concacaf, the confederation governing football in North and Central America and the Caribbean, Blazer had, in the words of the former Major League Soccer commissioner Doug Logan “brought [US] soccer into the modern television age almost single-handedly”.\nIn the process he transformed Concacaf from football bit-players dominated by Mexico into a competitive and hugely profitable confederation, with the US entering the spotlight. His success led him to 17 years on Fifa’s executive committee, as the first American Fifa executive in almost 50 years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Chuck Blazer, left, with Sepp Blatter, centre, and Franz Beckenbauer in 2005.

Blazer earned the nickname “Mr Ten Per Cent” because his contract as general secretary of Concacaf paid him 10% of all the income he brought in from TV, sponsorship and other activities. He and Concacaf’s president, Jack Warner, allegedly extended that deal to bribes, including the $10m that South Africa paid Warner through Fifa in 2008, ostensibly to support football in the “African diaspora”, but widely thought to be in reward for their votes for the country hosting the 2010 World Cup. Warner denies any wrongdoing.\nIn fairness, Blazer generated huge incomes for a confederation that previously had earned pittances, and 10% was cheap compared with fees charged by sports marketing agencies. But as he controlled Concacaf’s books, Blazer could take his cut of any payments: between 2006 and 2011, Blazer’s income from Concacaf was close to $21m.\nHis status within Fifa generated the largesse of globetrotting hospitality, as he was courted by nations seeking his vote for the rights to stage the World Cup. He changed the title of his blog to Travels With Chuck Blazer and Friends at the suggestion of Vladimir Putin, who told him he resembled Karl Marx, and who posted pictures to the site, alongside those of Blazer with Prince William and Nelson Mandela.\nBlazer also ran up nearly $30m on the corporate Amex card. Concacaf paid for his residences in the Bahamas, Miami and in Trump Tower, New York, where he maintained two apartments on the 49th floor, one housing his cats, while the confederation offices and a state-of-the-art television studio took up the entire 17th floor. Concacaf paid for his $50,000 Hummer SUV, and nearly half that sum annually to garage it, but Blazer more often moved about New York on one of his fleet of mobility scooters, with Max, his pet macaw, on his shoulder. The bird was a gift from his ex-wife, who had taught it to cackle “You’re a dope” at Blazer. He was scootering to his weekly dinner at Elaine’s, a restaurant for New York’s elite, in November 2011, when FBI and Internal Revenue agents first confronted him. Blazer became an informant; two years later he went to court.\nPleading guilty in 2013 to 10 counts of racketeering, money-laundering, wire fraud and tax evasion, Blazer detailed bribery, kickbacks and corruption in the voting for the Fifa presidency, the executive committee’s voting for World Cup host nations, and the staging, broadcast and sponsorship rights for various tournaments in the Americas.\nHis testimony was not made public for two years. Fifa had endured and outlasted many recent scandals, but the FBI built their case patiently, turning both Warner’s sons and an Argentinian businessman into informers. Their indictment included nine Fifa executives, four sports marketers, and one television executive. Fifa’s president, Sepp Blatter, was not mentioned; he was re-elected overwhelmingly by the Fifa congress in May 2015. But just four days later, following the release of Blazer’s depositions and the tracing of the South African payments to Concacaf through the Fifa offices, Blatter announced his resignation, though not effective for another six months.\nChuck was born in New York, where his parents ran a newsagent’s in the Rego Park section of Queens. At Forest Hills high schoo his classmates included Jerry Springer, and one summer he played saxophone in a band led by the future rock musician Al Kooper, but he was never involved in soccer. He earned a degree in accounting from New York University and married his high-school sweetheart, Susan Aufox.\nHe left NYU’s Stern business school before completing his MBA degree, and went to work in his father-in-law’s badge-making business. When the Smiley Face badge craze broke, Blazer became a major supplier and made extra money selling buttons to retailers in violation of his client’s exclusive rights. Blazer was a hustler, moving in and out of gimmicks and fads, already playing fast and loose with profits, losses and debt. He began channelling his business and payments through shell companies so that nothing, not even a salary, went directly into his accounts.\nHis life changed in 1976 when his son, Jason, began playing youth soccer in the upmarket suburb of New Rochelle. Blazer rose quickly to management of the Eastern New York State Soccer Association. In 1984 he arranged to host the USSF’s annual meeting, and persuaded Pelé himself to endorse his candidacy as international vice-president.\nOff the back of the successful Los Angeles Olympic football tournament, Blazer engineered a massive increase in matches for the US national team, which led to their qualifying for the 1990 World Cup, and oversaw the creation of the hugely successful women’s national team.\nHowever, when he failed to win re-election as USSF executive vice-president in 1986, he became one of the founders of the American Soccer League. Designed to function on a tiny budget, the league still paid Blazer more than any team’s salary budget. When he was forced out as commissioner, he took over the presidency of the franchise in Miami, increasing his salary and expenses, while the team drew barely 1,000 spectators per match. Within two years, the league folded.\nIn 1989, Blazer ran Warner’s campaign for the presidency of Concacaf. The two became friendly during his stint with the USSF, and when Warner won, he appointed Blazer general secretary, rewarding him with that 10% deal. Concacaf’s offices moved from Guatemala City to New York, and Blazer oversaw the creation of the Gold Cup, staged in the US, but a valuable television property in Mexico and South America.\nBlazer was instrumental in bringing the World Cup to the US in 1994, the same year he created a new company, Sportsvertising, in the Cayman Islands, through which his income was channelled. It was his failure to file tax returns over a period of six years that precipitated his downfall, alongside a rift in his relationship with Warner.\nIn December 2010 Qatar won the vote to stage the 2022 World Cup. In the first round, the US received only three votes, and Blazer’s suspicion that Warner had sold his vote to the Qataris seemed later to be confirmed by payments to Warner through the Concacaf accounts.\nIn 2011 Qatar’s Mohamed bin Hamman stood against Blatter for the Fifa presidency; barred from addressing Concacaf’s congress because he had been denied a US visa, Hamman spoke to a meeting of the Caribbean Football Union arranged by Warner. Delegates picked up envelopes containing $40,000 each; one of them notified Blazer, who then reported both Warner and Hamman to Fifa, whose ethics committee eventually removed them from the executive committee. Blazer lost his position at Concacaf.\nIt may have been the blatancy of that bribery scandal that set off the alarms among prosecutors in New York’s eastern district court. In 2013 Blazer left the executive committee and was replaced by Sunil Gulati, president of the USSF, who for years had worked in Blazer’s Trump Tower offices.\nBlazer’s marriage ended in divorce in 1995. He was being treated in hospital at the time of the 2015 arrests and never served time in prison. He was, however, suspended for life by Fifa. Warner and others named by Blazer still await trial, and Fifa suspended Blatter for six years.\nBlazer is survived by his son, Jason, and his daughter, Marci.\n• Charles Gordon Blazer, businessman and sports administrator, born 26 April 1945; died 12 July 2017\n",

        "date": "2016-05-11T23:04:23Z",
        "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/11/david-cameron-corporate-money-laundering-offence-anti-corruption-summit",
        "text": "\nDavid Cameron is to counter claims that his campaign against international corruption is hobbled by London’s reputation as the money laundering capital of the world by introducing a new corporate offence for executives who fail to prevent fraud or money laundering inside their companies.\nWriting in the Guardian before Thursday’s anti-corruption summit in the capital, the prime minister reveals plans to require all foreign companies buying property in the UK to disclose their true owners in a public register for the first time.\n\n\n\n\nDavid Cameron: The fight against corruption begins with political will\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy extending a corporate failure-to-prevent clause to fraud and money laundering, the government’s intention is to go further than merely requiring firms to prevent bribery and tax evasion. Should an employee be charged with money laundering, the company will be deemed liable if it cannot show that it had put procedures in place to prevent money laundering and fraud.\nCameron describes corruption as “one of the greatest enemies to progress” and says the new measures “will clean up our property market and send a clear message to the corrupt that there is no home for them here”. \nThe all-day summit at Lancaster House will be attended by the US secretary of state, John Kerry, and world leaders including Muhammadu Buhari, the Nigerian president, and Ashraf Ghani, the president of Afghanistan. On Tuesday, Cameron was caught on camera telling the Queen at a Buckingham Palace reception that both countries were “fantastically corrupt”.\n\n\n\n\nDavid Cameron to open London anti-corruption summit – live\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn his article, Cameron goes out of his way to praise the two presidents, saying they have shown the political will to fight corruption in their countries. Lauding their political commitment, he writes: “We know that real progress against corruption begins with political will.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n \nWhat are the top 10 most secretive tax havens?\n\n\nBuhari, who was elected on a mandate to fight corruption and has been given star billing at the unusually constructed summit, said on Wednesday that he was not going to demand an apology from Cameron, but hit back at the slow pace with which western governments returned assets stolen by corrupt former government officials. \n“Unfortunately, our experience has been that repatriation of corrupt proceeds is very tedious, time consuming, costly ... The repatriation of identified stolen funds should be done without delay or preconditions,” Buhari said.\nDescribing corruption as a hydra-headed monster and a cankerworm – a major pest – he conceded that Nigeria was corrupt, saying: “Cameron is being honest about it. I don’t think you can fault him.”\nIn an attempt to inspire a feeling of momentum, Cameron has lined up a series of announcements for Thursday, in addition to the firm commitment on corporate money laundering.\nHe promises that foreign companies that own properties in the UK will have to publicly register who ultimately controls them and he says no foreign company will be able to buy UK property or bid for central government contracts without joining the register. \nForeign companies own 100,000 properties in England and Wales, of which more than 44,000 are in London. “We will clean up our property market and send a clear message to the corrupt that there is no home for them here,” Cameron says.\nThe prime minister adds that if UK agencies believe that a property was bought with illicit wealth, the burden of proof could be reversed, with the owner required to show that legitimate funds were used in the purchase or else the assets would be seized.\nHe also promises:\n\n A small group of countries including France, Nigeria and the Netherlands will join the UK in committing to set up public registers of beneficial ownership. A further six countries, including Australia, will consider doing the same.\nSome UK overseas territories, not including the Cayman Islands or the British Virgin Islands (BVI), will join the UK and 33 other governments in agreeing to automatically and regularly share their registers of company ownership.\nA group of nations will make a commitment to sign an open data partnership, saying that transparency in public procurement will cut costs.\n\nCameron has registered his displeasure with the BVI’s refusal to join the automatic exchange initiative by refusing to invite its officials to the summit.\nDespite the refusal of some overseas territories to sign up to public registers, the prime minister said the package represented huge progress, adding that law enforcement agencies across the world would be able to use the data they provide to expose corruption.\nRobert Palmer of anti-corruption group Global Witness said: “The world is turning towards transparency and the tax havens are getting left behind. Today, we’ve seen good progress on stemming the flow of dirty money into UK property and more international cooperation on tackling corruption, but the biggest piece of the puzzle is still missing – the tax havens must open up.”\nThere was unhappiness in some quarters that the BVI and the Caymans, two of the largest offshore centres, had not been signed up to the ownership register. Alex Cobham of the Tax Justice Network said: “This looks like a major climbdown. It looks like the UK has given up before the anti-corruption summit has even begun. The Panama Papers have revealed to everyone just how much abuse takes place when ownership information is hidden. The UK has full legal authority to require this change so if the government has chosen not to, it is a comprehensive indictment of its willingness to fight corruption.”\nA No 10 spokesman said the government would continue to put pressure on the offshore jurisdictions, but stressed that they had already gone further than many other countries, including the US, where some states allow structures that disguise a company’s ultimate ownership.\nThe summit will also hear a discussion on how to crack down on corruption in world sport, with the International Olympic Committee on the panel. Fifa, the football governing body rocked by a corruption scandal, will not attend.\nSome anti-corruption campaigners are privately sceptical about the focus on sport, warning that it is a distraction from the more serious issue of cracking down on kleptocrats and the companies that help them to hide their ill-gotten gains.\nBut senior government officials said: “There’s a point here: most people in the world see a real value for sport, and you want to know, whether you’re playing or spectating, that the sport you’re watching or taking part in is a free and fair competition.” \nOn Wednesday, the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, pressed Cameron in the House of Commons over whether Conservative MEPs would support tougher rules to prevent multinationals dodging tax that are being voted on by the European parliament on Thursday.\n",

        "title": "Azerbaijan Laundromat shows UK is choice of crooks and despots, says Hodge",

        "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/oct/19/azerbaijan-laundromat-shows-uk-is-choice-of-crooks-and-despots-says-hodge",
        "text": "\nBritain is the “country of choice for every kleptocrat, crook and despot in the world”, a Labour MP has said following revelations by the Guardian and media partners of a massive money-laundering scheme run by the government of Azerbaijan. \nMargaret Hodge said the UK thought itself to be a “country of integrity, respectability and trustworthiness”. However, recent money-laundering scandals featuring Azerbaijan, Russia and the offshore industry showed this self-belief to be “flawed”, she told parliament.\nHodge – a former chair of the public accounts committee and an outspoken critic of corporate tax avoidance – was speaking in an adjournment debate on Thursday. She told MPs that UK corporate structures were being used for a wide range of crimes, including tax evasion and bribery. \nThis was happening because the government had failed to do anything about what she called a “persistent lack of transparency”. \nShe added: “We have become the safe haven for dirty money. We are allowing money laundering and tax avoidance to take place on an industrial scale. Our corporate rules and our weak regulatory framework are a gift to villains.” \nThe latest money-laundering scandal – nicknamed the Azerbaijan Laundromat – was exposed last month by the Guardian, the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project and other European media. The scheme ran between 2012 and 2014. Some $2.9bn (£2.2bn) was sent from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, via a Danish bank to accounts with four anonymously owned shell firms registered at Companies House in London.\n\nhow the azerbaijan laundromat operated\n\nThe cash was used “to curry influence and bribe European politicians, lobbyists and apologists”, Hodge said. It went on “lining the pockets” of Azerbaijan’s president, Ilham Aliyev, his family, and “their cronies”, she added. Some of it was also spent on private school fees.\nPayments were made to European politicians in Italy and Germany, as part of an influence operation designed to deflect criticism of Azerbaijan’s poor human rights record. Several of them of voted against motions in the Council of Europe’s parliamentary assembly (Pace) censuring Azerbaijan.\nThe Azerbajian Laundromat followed similar revelations earlier this year of a $20bn scheme run out of Moscow – the Russian Laundromat – and the Panama Papers, a 2016 leak of 11.5m documents that revealed the central role played by UK overseas territories such as the British Virgin Islands in international crime and tax cheating. \n“I feel deep shame and embarrassment that we in the UK are not just complicit, but central to the success of these despicable practices,” Hodge said. “At the moment it seems that Brexit has made us incapable of tackling any wrongdoing for fear of offending some other country in some other part of the world.”\nThe Labour MP Rupa Huq said that David Cameron had tried to clamp down on corruption and to introduce a UK property register revealing beneficial owners. But Downing Street had been using the “excuse of Brexit” to kick these initiatives “into the long grass”, she said. \nThe business minister Margot James said the government was considering reforms to stop criminals from exploiting UK companies. It had “serious concerns” about the way in which Scottish limited partnerships – two of which were used in the Azerbaijan Laundromat – were being abused, she said. \n",

        "text": "\nUK companies using an obscure Scottish business structure are at the centre of a multibillion-dollar operation to funnel cash out of Azerbaijan, an investigation by the Guardian has found. \nScottish limited partnerships (SLPs), structures originally established in the early 1900s for farm holdings, acted as shell companies to channel $2.9bn (£2.2bn) from Azerbaijan into the UK where it was used to buy luxury goods and peddle political influence throughout Europe.\nThe money was moved through the Glasgow-based companies Hilux Services LP and Polux Management LP via an Estonian branch of Danske Bank between 2012 and 2014, according to bank statements seen by the Guardian as part of a cross-border collaboration with the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP).\n\nazerbaijan atom\n\nThe companies, which have since been dissolved, benefited from loose national disclosure laws that allowed firms to hide the identity of their owners while enjoying the benefits of being a UK-registered company.\n“One of the real attractions for serious money, however it has been obtained, is finding a jurisdiction where the rule of law is predictable,” said L Burke Files, an international financial investigator. \n“When it comes to jurisdiction, would you prefer to use a company in Scotland, under Scottish law, or some place like Burkina Faso or Algeria where the judges go to the highest bidder?\n“The [SLP] structure and how it was crafted into law also provides for an element of privacy,” said Files. \nSome of the billions moved through the letter-box companies were used to pay for legitimate lobbying work for Azerbaijan, luxury goods and the medical expenses of the Azerbaijani political elite. The Scottish companies have also been linked to a corruption scandal involving the alleged bribery of a member of the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe.\n\nazerbaijani laundromat graphic\n\nAnti-money-laundering legislation was rushed through parliament in June to bring disclosure of the ownership of SLPs into line with EU law. However, there are still concerns the companies could be used as money-laundering vehicles.\n“At the moment the combination of corporate partners, minimum filing requirements, and separate legal personality make the Scottish limited partnership particularly attractive to those looking to use it as one of the layers in a money-laundering scheme,” said Duncan Hames, director of policy at Transparency International.\nTwo companies at the heart of the Azerbaijani money-laundering scheme, Hilux and Polux, were registered to a Mail Boxes Etc shop in Glasgow. The only trace of who may have controlled the laundering vehicles leads to the British Virgin Islands – another secrecy jurisdiction, where the registered partners are Solberg Business Limited and Akron Resources Corp.\nThe companies are among thousands of Scottish limited partnerships set up in the past decade. The number of SLPs increased rapidly following a tightening of the law elsewhere in the UK in 2006. The restriction prohibited private and limited companies from setting themselves up without a named individual as a director. However the change did not extend to SLPs and as a result it is still possible to register a company only disclosing corporate partners in an offshore jurisdiction.\nThe surge in the number of SLPs resulted in four times as many companies being created since 2006 as were established in the previous century.\nThe majority of the companies formed in the past decade are registered to a handful of locations, with thousands of SLPs at the same mailbox addresses. Of the new companies set up between 2006 and 2017, 70% are registered to just 10 addresses in Scotland, a report by Transparency International and Bellingcat found. More than 800 SLPs are registered to the mailbox address in central Glasgow that Hilux Services and Polux Management listed as their business address.\n\nSLPs registered in Scotland 2006-2017\n\nThe structures have also played a role in other UK-linked money-laundering schemes. A number of SLPs were involved in the Global Laundromat, a large-scale money-laundering scheme that moved more than $20bn (£16bn) out of Russia, reported by the Guardian in March. Over 50% of the money transacted through the Laundromat flowed through shell companies registered in London, Birmingham and Scotland.\nFollowing new anti-money-laundering legislation all SLPs were required to register people with significant control by 7 August. However, a review of the disclosures filed after the deadline shows the vast majority of partnerships have not yet disclosed who controls the company, while more than half the partnerships who have filed statements stated that they did not know who controlled the company or were taking steps to find out.\n“The initial responses really back up our suspicions about how many of these entities set up recently are being used,” said Hames. “Of those who have declared their beneficial ownership, an analysis by Bellingcat showed that there are as many based in the UK as there are in Russia and Ukraine. \n“Even the most recent information to come to light confirms the appetite for using this corporate vehicle in some high risk jurisdictions,” he added.\nThe new regulation requiring SLPs to declare people with significant control will not apply to Hilux and Polux as they were dissolved in 2016, before it came into force.\n",

        "text": "\nThe Commonwealth Bank has defended its decision to allow an unusually high $20,000 deposit limit on its “intelligent” deposit machines, which allegedly allowed drug syndicates to launder tens of millions of dollars, saying small businesses liked the larger limit.\nIan Narev, CBA’s chief executive, also tetchily defended the bank’s financial performance in the wake of the money laundering allegations, saying despite CBA’s share price falling 6% the share price was still higher than it was after the bank’s capital raising in 2015, and shareholders had received five dividends in recent years.\n\n\n\n\nCommonwealth Bank's Ian Narev undaunted by grilling over scandals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“All the Australians who bought into that capital raising, even after all this in the market, have done very well,” Narev said on Friday. “But that’s beside the point”.\nAppearing at a parliamentary inquiry into the major banks on Friday, Narev was joined by the CBA chairman, Catherine Livingstone, who was appearing before the committee for the first time.\nThe committee chair, the Liberal MP David Coleman, subjected Livingstone to a grilling, asking her why she had approved bonuses for CBA executives when she knew the bank had breached anti-money laundering laws by failing to report – more than 53,000 times – that its intelligent deposit machines (IDMs) had been used for cash transactions of $10,000 or more between 2012 and 2015.\nThe Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre has alleged that CBA failed to provide to authorities a total of 53,506 reports – known as threshold transaction reports – from November 2012 and September 2015.\nIt has alleged CBA became aware in April 2015 of “repeated suspicious and connected patterns of structured cash deposits followed by international money transfers”.\nThe explosive allegations led the lawyers Maurice Blackburn and the litigation funder IMF Bentham in August to announce a potential class action on behalf of Commonwealth Bank shareholders over a share price drop caused by money laundering allegations.\n\n\n\n\n \n\nIt is very hard to see how at bare minimum that is not extraordinarily incompetent\n\nDavid Coleman\n\n\n\nColeman wanted to know why CBA’s board didn’t disclose to shareholders in its 2015-16 remuneration report that it was aware of the IDM reporting breaches, and why CBA executives were still paid bonuses.\n“When it published that annual report in August, when you were on the board … there were five criteria for so-called short-term executive bonuses … and what the board said was … four of those five were on target, and that one was above target,” Coleman said on Friday.\n“The board did not identify in that remuneration report any issue related to the executive management team’s conduct despite the fact that you knew about the TTR [threshold transaction reports] issue which, as you know, is potentially literally billions of dollars of exposure to the bank in terms of the potential fines that can be issued.”\nLivingstone told Coleman she was “firmly of the view” that the bank had met all its continuous disclosure obligations at the time, and she stood by her decision to sign off on the remuneration report.\n“On the basis of the facts that the board knew at that time, we made the right determination,” she said. “A board has to operate on the basis of the knowledge that it has at any one time. We believe we have done that. We take these matters extremely seriously.”\n\n\n\n\nComm Bank scandal: what happens when too much power is placed in too few hands | Tom Westland\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColeman replied: “You signed off on a remuneration report that found all metrics had been met, and one, which actually relates to risk … was above target … It is very hard to see how at bare minimum that is not extraordinarily incompetent, if not more problematic for the individual directors than that.”\nLivingstone said: “The period to which you relate, and the events of that time, are the subject of Austrac civil proceedings and therefore unfortunately I’m not in a position to go into detail.”\nNarev, who will be leaving CBA by mid-2018, said the bank had decided to set a 200-banknote deposit limit on its IDMs to satisfy its small business customers, and that had set a theoretical deposit limit of $20,000. \nThe Labor MP Matt Thistlethwaite said: “If you’re a criminal and you want to launder $3.5m and send it overseas through one of these machines, if CBA’s takes 200 notes and the other [banks’ machines] take a quarter of that, it’s a no-brainer isn’t it, for a criminal?”\nNarev said: “We are certainly open and eager to have any discussions we can based on what we’ve learned about whatever changes we should make [to these machines] that will make us do our job better.”\n",

        "text": "\nBritish and Dutch authorities have seized more than €6m (£5.1m) worth of assets – including luxury cars, a speedboat and properties – from an Anglo-Dutch couple accused of running a multinational tax avoidance scheme.\nDozens of officers raided the couple’s homes in Macclesfield, the Netherlands and Austria in a complex international tax fraud investigation. A 46-year-old woman from Macclesfield was arrested during the raid, and a warrant has been issued for the arrest of a 51-year-old Dutch man in connection with allegations of money laundering and multimillion-pound tax avoidance.\nThe authorities seized a Bentley, a Jaguar and a BMW, as well as a speedboat, cash, computers and two villas in the Netherlands. \n\n\n\n\nCredit Suisse embroiled in major global tax evasion investigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPaul Maybury, assistant director of fraud investigations at HM Revenue & Customs, said: “We are working closely with our partners in the Netherlands and Austria to tackle suspected tax evasion.\n“The vast majority of taxpayers pay the tax they owe, but where we suspect people aren’t paying what’s due, we will use our full range of powers to ensure that nobody is beyond our reach. People cannot hide money offshore thanks to this international cooperation.\n“Businesses that commit tax fraud are not just stealing from the public purse, but also have an unfair advantage over honest businesses who pay the right taxes.”\nDutch prosecutors said the raids, which involved 28 British officers, were launched after the couple withdrew more than €300,000 (£256,000) in cash using credit cards linked to offshore accounts. The Dutch authorities said they suspected the couple, who own a marketing company in Manchester, committed tax fraud via a complex web of companies and offshore bank accounts in several countries. \nThe arrests were part of a fresh Dutch-led crackdown on offshore tax evasion after the leak of thousands of “black” accounts held at Swiss bank Credit Suisse. Last week, authorities seized millions of euros in cash, gold, jewellery, real estate and paintings across the Netherlands and France, from holders of some of the 55,000 suspect accounts. \nThe Dutch Fiscal Information and Investigation Service (FIOD) said the couple’s suspect transactions were captured by a project that automatically flags up debit and credit cards that are linked to foreign assets, and checks whether taxpayers have declared the assets.\n\n\n\n\nTough penalties for enablers of tax avoidance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Their assumed illegally obtained profits have been laundered in the Netherlands, where the suspects own two houses, where they stay on a regular basis,” the FIOD said in a statement. \nThe Dutch authorities last week revealed they had been given details of more than 55,000 suspect Credit Suisse accounts by a whistleblower. Dozens of Dutch taxpayers are under investigation, and coordinated raids have been carried out across Europe and Australia.\nHigh-ranking bank employees in Britain, Germany and Australia are under investigation. Dutch prosecutors said they acted after receiving a tip-off on assets hidden within “offshore accounts and policies”. Credit Suisse offices in London, Paris and Amsterdam have been searched by local authorities.\nThe action has prompted fresh calls for an end to Swiss banking secrecy. If proven, evasion on this scale would amount to a “global criminal enterprise”, said Alex Cobham, chief executive of the Tax Justice Network. \nHMRC said it had launched a criminal investigation into suspected tax evasion and money laundering by a global financial institution and its employees. Warning of “further, targeted, activity over the coming weeks”, HMRC said its efforts were focused on the bank’s staff and “a number of its customers”.\n",

        "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/20/the-global-laundromat-how-did-it-work-and-who-benefited",
        "text": "\nWhat is the Laundromat?\nThe Laundromat is a name given by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project to a vast money-laundering scheme. Between autumn 2010 and spring 2014 Russian officials and insiders moved billions of dollars into Europe, the US and other countries. Law enforcement officers in Moldova and Latvia have tracked down at least $20bn in dirty money. They believe the real total may be as high as $80bn. Not all of those involved in the Laundromat have been identified. \nWhat is money laundering?\nA process where you take money gained from crime and clean it so that it appears to have come from a legitimate source. Typically this involves multiple transactions.\nHow did the Laundromat work?\nThe scheme was ingenious. In many cases, it involved fictitious companies. Most were registered in London at Companies House. Typically, company A “loaned” a large sum of money to company B. Other businesses in Russia – fronted by Moldovans – would then guarantee these “loans”. Company B would fail to return the “money”. Moldovan judges would authenticate the “debt”, allowing Russian companies to transfer real money to a bank in Moldova. From here, the cash went to a bank in Latvia, inside the EU.\nWho else was involved?\nAt least 19 Russian banks. One of them was the Russian Land Bank (RZB). It laundered $9.7bn. From accounts in Russia, money was sent to other accounts at Moldindconbank in Moldova. From there it was transferred to Trasta Komercbanka, in Latvia’s capital, Riga. In Moldova, 15 judges are awaiting trial, together with 10 senior bank managers, central bank officials and four bailiffs. All face money-laundering charges. Ukrainians and Moldovans appear in the scheme too, typically as “directors” of fake UK companies. Most had no clue they were frontmen for a major international scam.\nWhere did the money go?\nEverywhere. The $20bn went via the global financial system to 96 countries. That includes bigger nations such as the US, UK, Germany, France and China, and smaller ones like Slovenia and Taiwan. The money flowed through 21 hub companies, with names such as Seabon and Valemont Properties Ltd. The majority were registered in the UK and made brief annual records. Some were based in Cyprus, an EU island with Moscow ties. Their owners or beneficiaries are hidden behind a network of shadowy offshore administrators.\nWhat about the UK?\nThe total sent to UK bank accounts was $738.1m. Records obtained by the OCCRP show how some of it was spent: on furs, diamonds, designer chandeliers, and fees at one of Britain’s top private schools. It was used to book rock bands to play in Russia, including a long-haired outfit from Florida. It went on home cinema equipment, and expensive wallpaper. Some of the money flowed into London real estate, including a pub in Bloomsbury and a townhouse in Kensington. All major British banks processed money that had already been laundered. The government-owned Royal Bank of Scotland processed $113.1m, and HSBC $545.3m. \nAnd the US? \nMore than $63m went to the US. Leading American banks were involved, including Citibank and Bank of America. The cash went on aesthetic dentistry, consulting, luxury diving watches and other items. The only banks that raised money-laundering concerns were American ones. The Bank of New York Mellon rejected payments.\nWho benefited from the Laundromat?\nThe Laundromat functioned as a giant shadow banking system. At the top were a number of users and super-users, all impeccably connected to the Russian elite. Some Russian businessmen importing goods into Russia used the scheme unwittingly. They hired third-party logistics companies to deal with Russian customs. These freight forwarding firms made heavy use of the Laundromat. There are suspicions that well-connected bureaucrats took a cut.\nHas anyone been arrested?\nYes. The alleged architect of the scheme is a Moldovan businessman, Vyacheslav Platon – a former MP and Moldindconbank shareholder. Ukrainian police arrested him in 2016 and extradited him to Moldova to face fraud and money-laundering charges. Platon calls the accusations “drivel”. He says there is no evidence of a “predicate crime”: that the money sent from Russia was stolen. Platon is a Russian and Moldovan citizen. He blames his arrest on others. Meanwhile, banks including RZB and Baltica in Russia and Trasta Komercbanka in Latvia have been shut down for money laundering. The Laundromat firms were dissolved in 2015-16.\nWho is investigating? \nMoldova, Latvia and possibly Russia. Investigators have spent months assembling bank records and chasing down complex money trails. In 2014 two officers from Russia’s FSB spy agency visited detectives in Moldova. They took away records. It is unclear if this was a genuine investigation or an attempt to discover how much the Moldovans knew. Probably the latter. This month Moldova said its diplomats were being “treated abusively” whenever they entered Russia. Moldova linked this harassment by Russian security services to its ongoing Laundromat investigation. It said Russian law enforcement was “totally uncooperative”. \n",

        "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/03/donald-trump-russia-steve-bannon-michael-wolff",
        "text": "\nDonald Trump’s former chief strategist Steve Bannon has described the Trump Tower meeting between the president’s son and a group of Russians during the 2016 election campaign as “treasonous” and “unpatriotic”, according to an explosive new book seen by the Guardian.\n\n\n\n\nTrump-Russia investigation: the key questions answered\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBannon, speaking to author Michael Wolff, warned that the investigation into alleged collusion with the Kremlin will focus on money laundering and predicted: “They’re going to crack Don Junior like an egg on national TV.”\nFire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House, reportedly based on more than 200 interviews with the president, his inner circle and players in and around the administration, is one of the most eagerly awaited political books of the year. In it, Wolff lifts the lid on a White House lurching from crisis to crisis amid internecine warfare, with even some of Trump’s closest allies expressing contempt for him.\nBannon, who was chief executive of the Trump campaign in its final three months, then White House chief strategist for seven months before returning to the rightwing Breitbart News, is a central figure in the nasty, cutthroat drama, quoted extensively, often in salty language.\n\n\n\n\n'Idiot': Murdoch mocked Trump after phone call on immigration, book claims\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe is particularly scathing about a June 2016 meeting involving Trump’s son Donald Jr, son-in-law Jared Kushner, then campaign chairman Paul Manafort and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya at Trump Tower in New York. A trusted intermediary had promised documents that would “incriminate” rival Hillary Clinton but instead of alerting the FBI to a potential assault on American democracy by a foreign power, Trump Jr replied in an email: “I love it.”\nThe meeting was revealed by the New York Times in July last year, prompting Trump Jr to say no consequential material was produced. Soon after, Wolff writes, Bannon remarked mockingly: “The three senior guys in the campaign thought it was a good idea to meet with a foreign government inside Trump Tower in the conference room on the 25th floor – with no lawyers. They didn’t have any lawyers.\n“Even if you thought that this was not treasonous, or unpatriotic, or bad shit, and I happen to think it’s all of that, you should have called the FBI immediately.”\nBannon went on, Wolff writes, to say that if any such meeting had to take place, it should have been set up “in a Holiday Inn in Manchester, New Hampshire, with your lawyers who meet with these people”. Any information, he said, could then be “dump[ed] … down to Breitbart or something like that, or maybe some other more legitimate publication”.\nBannon added: “You never see it, you never know it, because you don’t need to … But that’s the brain trust that they had.”\nBannon also speculated that Trump Jr had involved his father in the meeting. “The chance that Don Jr did not walk these jumos up to his father’s office on the twenty-sixth floor is zero.” \n\nInteractive\n\nSpecial counsel Robert Mueller was appointed last May, following Trump’s dismissal of FBI director James Comey, to investigate Russian meddling in the 2016 election. This has led to the indictments of four members of Trump’s inner circle, including Manafort and former national security adviser Michael Flynn. Manafort has pleaded not guilty to money laundering charges; Flynn has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI. In recent weeks Bannon’s Breitbart News and other conservative outlets have accused Mueller’s team of bias against the president.\nTrump predicted in an interview with the New York Times last week that the special counsel was “going to be fair”, though he also said the investigation “makes the country look very bad”. The president and his allies deny any collusion with Russia and the Kremlin has denied interfering.\nBannon has criticised Trump’s decision to fire Comey. In Wolff’s book, obtained by the Guardian ahead of publication from a bookseller in New England, he suggests White House hopes for a quick end to the Mueller investigation are gravely misplaced.\n“You realise where this is going,” he is quoted as saying. “This is all about money laundering. Mueller chose [senior prosecutor Andrew] Weissmann first and he is a money-laundering guy. Their path to fucking Trump goes right through Paul Manafort, Don Jr and Jared Kushner … It’s as plain as a hair on your face.”\nLast month it was reported that federal prosecutors had subpoenaed records from Deutsche Bank, the German financial institution that has lent hundreds of millions of dollars to the Kushner property empire. Bannon continues: “It goes through Deutsche Bank and all the Kushner shit. The Kushner shit is greasy. They’re going to go right through that. They’re going to roll those two guys up and say play me or trade me.”\nScorning apparent White House insouciance, Bannon reaches for a hurricane metaphor: “They’re sitting on a beach trying to stop a Category Five.”\n\n\n\n\nDonald Trump boasts that his nuclear button is bigger than Kim Jong-un's\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe insists that he knows no Russians, will not be a witness, will not hire a lawyer and will not appear on national television answering questions.\nFire and Fury will be published next week. Wolff is a prominent media critic and columnist who has written for the Guardian and is a biographer of Rupert Murdoch. He previously conducted interviews for the Hollywood Reporter with Trump in June 2016 and Bannon a few months later.\nHe told the Guardian in November that to research the book, he showed up at the White House with no agenda but wanting to “find out what the insiders were really thinking and feeling”. He enjoyed extraordinary access to Trump and senior officials and advisers, he said, sometimes at critical moments of the fledgling presidency.\nThe rancour between Bannon and “Javanka” – Kushner and his wife Ivanka Trump – is a recurring theme of the book. Kushner and Ivanka are Jewish. Henry Kissinger, the former secretary of state, is quoted as saying: “It is a war between the Jews and the non-Jews.”\nTrump is not spared. Wolff writes that Thomas Barrack Jr, a billionaire who is one of the president’s oldest associates, allegedly told a friend: “He’s not only crazy, he’s stupid.” Barrack denied that to the New York Times. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "\nCometh the hour, cometh the man. With Philip “the Undertaker” Hammond still sulking about his budget and refusing to talk to anyone, it was left to Simon Kirby, the City minister who looks like a cross between Swiss Toni and Geert Wilders – though without the gravitas – to take the hit for the government.\nKirby was on a warning. Having recently been relieved of any involvement in Brexit after everyone realised he was hopelessly out of his depth, the Treasury was conducting a process of elimination to discover if there was anything he could do well. On the basis of his answers to an urgent question from Labour on the Guardian’s allegations about British banks processing billions of pounds of dirty Russian money, the answer might well be nothing. Kirby is a man who likes to keep his talents well hidden.\n“We want our financial institutions to lead the way in money laundering,” Kirby announced, inadvertently sounding disappointed that our banks had yet to compete with Switzerland and the Cayman Islands for handling crime proceeds. “We will do what it takes,” he continued, his finger moving over the relevant lines in the statement what he had wrote. The government was doing lots and lots. So much, that he couldn’t quite remember any of it.\nThe shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, began by accusing Kirby of complacency – this was harsh; Kirby might be stupid, but that doesn’t necessarily make him complacent – before going on to point out that, of the banks implicated in the scandal, HSBC had form, RBS was three-quarters owned by the government and Barclays had been involved in Libor rigging. Was this not cause for concern about the stability of the financial system?\nNot really, shrugged Kirby. He was sure that the Financial Conduct Authority and the National Crime Agency were doing a fine job and if anyone was capable of sniffing out wrongdoing it was them. Besides which, he was in the process of consulting on something, though he couldn’t say what as he would have to kill everyone if he did. But make no mistake, the something he would be consulting on would be a big step forward.\nConservative David Nuttall tried to help the minister by pointing out that he had been made to fill in loads of money laundering forms to open a personal bank account. Good point, observed Kirby. It was precisely because the rules about money laundering were so comprehensive and complicated that the banks were struggling. What was needed was a relaxation of the laws.\nAfter that, the Labour benches went for Kirby. Angela Eagle said that he had no idea of the scale of the scandal while John Mann observed: “You appear to have been promoted beyond your competence.” No one disagreed. Could the minister say which banks had been prosecuted for money laundering in the last five years and what he had learned from those judgments? Give me a break, Kirby pleaded. He had only heard about the Global Laundromat story that morning – and he hadn’t got further than the first few paragraphs, as it was all terribly complicated.\n“Right and proper,” Kirby jabbered desperately. “Everything is right and proper.” Apart from the things that weren’t right and proper, and he wouldn’t rest until they were right and proper. Just please stop asking him difficult questions as he didn’t know any of the answers.\nCould he say how many money launderers had been sent to prison in the past five years? No chance. Would he like to have a guess? Not really. Oh go on, think of a number. “I’m not aware of the exact number,” he said, though he was convinced that he took everything very seriously and it was right and proper that money launderers should go to prison if they were bang to rights.\nKirby was no clearer on whether Russian dosh had influenced the Brexit vote but frankly he wasn’t that bothered. “I should imagine the Foreign Office is dealing with that,” he said. Would he like to check on that? Nah. Imagining was just fine.\n“You’re appalling at this, are you?” said Labour’s Rushanara Ali. “Can we have the chancellor next time?” \nKirby sobbed. If only. \n",

        "text": "\nSenior Democrats on Capitol Hill are calling for a congressional investigation into the justice department’s handling of an ongoing inquiry into Deutsche Bank, saying that Donald Trump had conflicts of interest with the German bank, his biggest creditor.\nMaxine Waters, the top Democrat on the House financial services committee, urged her Republican colleagues to launch their own investigation into the nature of Deutsche Bank’s money-laundering scheme, who participated in the arrangement and whether it involved any other violations of US law beyond the failure to maintain anti-money laundering controls.\n\n\n\n\nHow Donald Trump became Deutsche Bank's biggest headache\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeutsche Bank has already been ordered to pay more than $800m (£660m) in fines in the US and UK for failing to stop the improper and corrupt transfer of more than $10bn out of Russia. It is also being investigated by the justice department (DoJ).\nThe Guardian reported last month that the German bank undertook a close examination of the president’s personal bank account and those held by his family, in order to ascertain whether they had any suspicious links to Russia. None were found. \nAccording to an analysis by Bloomberg, Trump now owes Deutsche about $300m. He has four large mortgages, all issued by Deutsche’s private bank. \nWaters said in a letter to Jeb Hensarling, the chairman of the House financial services committee, that she was concerned “about the integrity of this criminal probe” given Trump’s “conflicts of interest” and the “suspicious ties” between Trump’s inner circle and the Russian government. \nShe cited the testimony of Jeff Sessions, the US attorney general, who swore under oath during his confirmation hearing that he had never had any contact with Russian officials during the presidential campaign, even though it was subsequently revealed that he had two meetings with the Russian ambassador to the US, Sergey Kislyak.\nSessions has recused himself from the DoJ’s investigation into allegations that Russia meddled in the US election, possibly with the help of Trump campaign officials. The department’s investigation into Deutsche Bank, however, still appears to be under Sessions’s purview.\nWaters said the Trump administration’s “extensive ties” to Russian government officials and oligarchs raised serious concerns about whether the president and his inner circle would direct the DoJ to steer clear of issues that could implicate those who benefited from the Deutsche Bank scheme. \nThe alleged ties between Russia and a top administration official were also the subject of another letter on Friday. Cory Booker, a Democratic senator from New Jersey, and four other Democrats, sent a letter to Wilbur Ross, the newly confirmed commerce secretary, demanding more information about his role as vice-chair of the Bank of Cyprus.\nRoss, a billionaire investor who has claimed in a private conversation with another senator, Bill Nelson, that the White House is “sitting on” his responses, has not replied to two other letters sent by senators before his confimation hearing.\nBooker and others, who said they wanted a response from Ross by 24 March, are seeking more information about whether anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign or Trump Organization received direct or indirect loans from the Bank of Cyprus and whether the bank sought to influence the 2016 presidential election.\nThe senators wanted more information about Ross’s relationship with three Russian officials who were and may still be investors in the bank: Vladimir Strzhalkovsky, Dmitry Rybolovlev and Viktor Vekselberg. It also wanted more information about Ross’s relationship to Josef Ackermann, the former chief executive of Deutsche Bank who was installed as chairman of Bank of Cyprus after Ross was part of a consortium that invested $1bn in the bank in 2014. \nAmong other questions, the senators wanted to know whether Ross had ever met the Russian ambassador or any other Russian government officials; ever met Russian investors at Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s Florida golf club, and whether the bank was involved with any individuals placed under US sanctions following Russia’s annexation of Crimea.\n",

        "text": "\nMEPs on a fact-finding mission to Malta after the killing of the investigative journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia have said they arrived “seriously concerned” about the rule of law on the island and were leaving “even more worried”.\nDispatched after the European parliament demanded that EU authorities open a formal dialogue with Malta over the death, the delegation said an apparent reluctance to investigate and prosecute major cases had created a “perception of impunity”.\nThe Portuguese Socialist MEP Ana Gomes said the delegation found it “extremely disturbing” that some of the officials it met did not answer its questions. One, prime minister Joseph Muscat’s chief of staff, Keith Schembri, read out a prepared statement, she said, while another “never showed up”.\nThe German Green MEP Sven Giegold said after two days of meetings with government officials, regulators, local journalists media and civil rights activists that he was particularly concerned about the island’s police and attorney general.\nBoth had demonstrated “a high degree of unwillingness to investigate and a failure to prosecute corruption and money-laundering”, Giegold said, adding he left a meeting with senior police officials with an impression of “incompetence”. \nGiegold said publicly available information and even reports by the anti-money laundering agency FIAU had failed to trigger investigations, “protecting high government officials and financial institutions”. \nMalta’s judicial system “has demonstrated systemic problems rooted in Malta’s constitution”, he said, adding that the prime minister’s right to appoint top officials had severely weakened the judicial system and financial supervision.\nCaruana Galizia, whose hugely popular blog attacked high-level corruption, shady business dealings and organised crime on the island, died in October in a powerful car bomb yards from her home.\nHer family are taking legal action against the island’s police, saying the investigation into the killing cannot be impartial and independent since it is being run by a senior officer married to a top government minister who was the subject of critical articles by Caruana Galizia.\nThe MEPs’ delegation would now submit its report and recommendations, Giegold said, and pursue “continued dialogue with the European commission in the run-up to an article 7 procedure”, a formal audit of the rule of law in a member state.\n",

        "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/07/bulgaria-to-investigate-azerbaijan-money-laundering-claims",
        "text": "\nBulgaria has ordered an investigation after revelations by the Guardian and other media partners that Azerbaijan operated a secret $2.9bn fund to lobby influential Europeans and to funnel money offshore.\nProsecutor Sotir Tsatsarov said he was launching an inquiry into Kalin Mitrev, Bulgaria’s representative to the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). Mitrev received at least €425,000 (£390,000) from the scheme, which has been nicknamed the Azerbaijan Laundromat.\nMitrev denies wrongdoing. He says the payments to his Swiss and Bulgarian accounts were for legitimate consultancy work and happened before he joined the bank’s board in London. The reports were a “doomed political attack” on his wife, Irina Bokova, the director general of Unesco, Mitrev said.\nOfficials will seek to establish whether there is evidence of tax evasion or money laundering, the prosecutor’s office in Sofia announced on Thursday. Mitrev denies being aware of the original source of the funds and says he declared the income in Bulgaria and paid tax in full.\nMitrev’s future remains unclear after his case was discussed on Thursday by Bulgaria’s cabinet. Speaking afterwards, Vladislav Goranov, the finance minister, said his government had not taken a position on whether Mitrev should be removed from his EBRD job and that it had written to the bank asking for its view.\nOn Thursday, the EBRD said only Bulgaria could take action against Mitrev, or exonerate him. His role was equivalent to that of an ambassador, it said, adding that he was not an employee. Board members from other European states are concerned by the Laundromat revelations and would like Mitrev to stand down, it is understood.\nBulgaria’s investigation comes at a sensitive time for the bank, which is on the brink of making a significant loan to Azerbaijan. The EBRD’s president, Suma Chakrabati, is on a two-day visit to Azerbaijani capital, Baku. The bank, founded in 1991, was established to support eastern Europe and to develop its private sector.\nAt stake is the future of the controversial southern gas corridor, the largest energy project the EU is pursuing together with Baku. Records loans in European public money are being considered for sections of the pipeline, which will transport gas from Azerbaijan to Italy. BP and Azerbaijan’s state-owned energy firm are key partners.\nIn October the EBRD will decide at a board meeting whether to give Azerbaijan a $500m (£380m) loan. \nSarah Shoraka, a spokesperson with the campaigning group Platform, said the payments to Mitrev could be “a huge stain on the bank’s reputation”. Until the case was properly investigated, the EBRD should suspend any decision on the gas corridor project, she said.\nXavier Sol, director of the bank-monitoring organisation Counter Balance, said the Laundromat revelations came at a time when the EU was strengthening its ties with the Azerbaijani regime. It was negotiating the gas deal together with a comprehensive agreement with Baku to replace an existing partnership arrangement.\nSol said: “European public banks are considering huge loans for the southern gas corridor. Such loans would send a worrying signal of political support to the Azerbaijani regime despite ongoing human rights violations in the country.”\nMitrev is an EBRD veteran. He has served on the bank’s board on and off since 1996 and is known as a well-respected and influential voice. \nThe revelation that Mitrev has consulted for an Azerbaijani company is awkward for Bokova because of her UN role. She bestowed one of Unesco’s highest honours, the Mozart medal, on Azerbaijan’s first lady and vice-president, Mehriban Aliyeva, who is a long-time Unesco goodwill ambassador.\nBokova has denied that there is a conflict between her husband’s work and her UN role.\n\nClarification: It has been suggested to us by Kalin Mitrev that this article may be understood as alleging that he was involved in corruption and/or money laundering in association with the Azerbaijani Laundromat. Whilst we do not agree with Mr Mitrev that the article conveys such a meaning, we are happy to make it clear that that we did not intend to suggest this.\n\n",

        "text": "\nJeremy Corbyn has rounded on Theresa May over her government’s record on curbing tax avoidance and evasion, saying failure to ensure the super-rich paid their share meant there was now “one rule for the rich and another for the rest of us”.\nThe Labour leader used prime minister’s questions to call out the Conservatives for repeatedly blocking legislation, both at home and in Europe, that would combat tax fraud and financial crime.\n\n\n\n\nPMQs verdict: Jeremy Corbyn started strong but fizzled out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said the amount of tax paid by Britain’s wealthiest citizens had fallen from £4.4bn to £3.5bn since 2009. A report by MPs earlier this year described HM Revenue and Customs’ record on getting the super-rich to pay their taxes as dismal. \nAfter a brief mention of the escalating Westminster sexual harassment scandal, which has seen accusations made against MPs on both sides of the house, Corbyn devoted all his questions to tax.\nHe said Britain had been working to block a French proposal that would have placed Bermuda, a UK overseas territory and key location for offshore companies, on an EU blacklist of tax havens.\nUnder pressure to demonstrate her government was serious about fighting evasion, May said the Conservatives had taken action in relation to the overseas territories. “This party has not just been acting in the UK,” she said. “We have been working with the overseas territories and crown dependencies, and we have been leading the world.”\nCorbyn questioned plans to cut 8,000 jobs at the tax office and highlighted an admission by tax collectors last week that multinationals had avoided paying £5.8bn in taxes in 2016, £2bn more than forecast.\nMEPs on the European parliament’s inquiry into money laundering, tax avoidance and tax evasion, set up in the wake of the Panama Papers scandal, claimed last week that British Conservatives had repeatedly obstructed the fight against tax dodging and money laundering by voting down legislation designed to curb it.\nCorbyn also called on the government to fully investigate allegations of tax avoidance involving private jets on the Isle of Man. The Manx government called in the UK Treasury 10 days ago to review 270 schemes used for the import of business jets into Europe via the island.\nThe Isle of Man has registered 957 business jets, the term used to describe the type of aircraft used for private jets, in the past 10 years. “Nine hundred and fifty-seven business jets in the Isle of Man seems a bit excessive for any island anywhere,” Corbyn said. \nThe prime minister vowed HMRC would take any cases referred to it seriously.\n",

        "text": "\nThree years ago on Monday, I stood in Maidan square in Kiev, among the tents and barricades erected by a hardcore of protesters still camped out there, refusing to leave until the government had finally rid itself of corruption. Stalls sold toilet paper with Russian president Vladimir Putin’s face on it. The atmosphere remained charged.\nThe square was the site of Ukraine’s Euromaidan revolution that ousted the country’s former president, Viktor Yanukovych, in February 2014. Just two months later, in early spring, pro-Russia separatists had seized buildings in cities across eastern Ukraine. By July, fighting between them and the Ukrainian army had intensified. Maidan was a centre of gossip about the war in the country’s east.\nNews came in about a civilian plane crash. Details were sketchy but it soon became clear that Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17, travelling from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpar, had been shot down, killing all 283 passengers and 15 crew on board.\nThe political fallout was huge. Thus far, the fighting in Ukraine had extended only to Russian and Ukrainian – largely military – casualties. Now more than 200 EU and foreign civilians were dead.\nThe then British prime minister David Cameron was unequivocal: “President Putin faces a clear choice in how he decides to respond to this appalling tragedy. I hope he will use this moment to find a path out of this festering and dangerous crisis by ending Russia’s support for the separatists,” he said in an address to the Commons.\nCameron talked tough. But he did little. And herein lies the problem. After Flight MH17 was shot down, an international joint investigation team was set up to discover what exactly had happened. Last year, it concluded that a Buk missile system from Russia had been driven to rebel-controlled eastern Ukraine, where it shot down MH17 before returning home the same day. Moscow’s culpability was not in doubt. But three years on, not one single person has been arrested, let alone prosecuted. And in the meantime, the families of 298 victims continue to grieve with no possibility of justice in sight.\n\n\n\n\nMH17 'killers' will be brought to justice, says Australian PM Malcolm Turnbull\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe MH17 tragedy illustrates two things: first, an increasingly aggressive Russia is becoming more of a problem not less. While the world has turned its eyes from the Ukraine conflict, it continues to rage. Second, that we in the west, especially Britain – with a City of London that Russia uses to launder its dirty money – are complicit. According to Ben Judah, author of the Kleptocracy Curse: “Two powerful trends meet in London: the rise of the offshore financial system and the rise of globalised authoritarians.”\nAnd there is no greater example of globalised authoritarianism than Putin, and the elites that surround him. According to Judah’s research, the London financial system has become a capital of Russian money laundering. The Financial Services Authority, before its dissolution, estimated that money laundering accounted for 3.6% of British GDP. Property is the primary asset through which offshore companies launder dirty money in London, Judah tells me. Anonymous offshore companies now own more than 37,000 properties in the capital – amounting to more than 2.25 square miles. The National Crime Agency has warned that the scale of money laundering in London constitutes “a strategic threat to the UK’s economy and reputation”.\nKremlin elites own our mansions, their children attend our finest schools; they buy our art and football clubs. They pay our lawyers. Russian influence in Britain is greater than at any point during the cold war. And, while Moscow will tolerate perfunctory condemnation of what it does in Ukraine, decisive action is off the table: “Our people own large parts of your capital and its institutions. Mess with us at your peril.”\nThis state of affairs is unacceptable. Britain must push back – and, in fairness, it has been better on this issue than many of its European counterparts. But its efforts are still insufficient. This must change. First, we must reaffirm our commitment to European unity – even during a time of Brexit. Only a united Europe can combat the Kremlin. Second, we must overhaul financial regulations. In this area, Labour has the right policies.\nWe must set up an immediate national enquiry to develop a strategy to combat tax avoidance and kleptocracy. No anonymous companies should be allowed to do business or own assets in Britain. The government must create a public register of all trusts showing their assets and beneficiaries as a matter of urgency. At all times, greater transparency is the goal. These policies alone won’t cure London’s corruption epidemic. But they are a start.\nJust as we once helped to contain Soviet military power, we must now help to contain Russian financial power. Until this happens there will be no justice for the 298 civilians who died on that tragic day three years ago.\n",

The government wants that figure to be 60% for more senior executives, such as CEOs.\nTurnbull said on Tuesday the plan was “modelled on measures that were taken in the United Kingdom”. \nUnder the proposed legislation, the banking regulator, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, would be given greater powers. \nApra would be able to force bank boards to adjust their remuneration policies if they produce inappropriate outcomes, to push directors out of the industry for bad behaviour, and to force all senior executives in the banking industry to register with the regulator so it can keep records of their behaviour.\nThe move comes after the Commonwealth Bank board announced its embattled chief executive, Ian Narev, would step aside next year.\n\n\n\n\nTimeline: banking scandals in Australia since 2009\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommonwealth Bank is still dealing with the fallout from claims it committed “serious and systemic” violations of laws designed to combat the funding of terrorism, stretching back to 2015.\nNarev took home more than $12m in pay last year, and the bank unveiled a record $9.9bn profit earlier this month.\nThe treasurer, Scott Morrison, said Commonwealth Bank still had “a lot of work to do” to amend for the current scandal, and there would be “further announcements” from government about it.\nHe said the government would introduce tougher legislation “in the next few weeks” to crack down on executive salaries and dodgy executives. \n“The banking executive accountability regime (Bear), which I’ll be introducing into the parliament in the next few weeks and months, that regime puts accountability back in the senior levels of our banking system,” Morrison told the ABC on Monday.\n“You can’t go around and make decisions that affect the lives of millions of Australians and just walk away.”\nThe government released its crackdown plans in its 2017-18 budget in May, and Treasury released a consultation paper in July explaining the plans in detail, but this is the first time the government will try to introduce the plans to parliament.\n\n\n\n\nCommonwealth Bank unmasked: why the government is suing over alleged terrorism trail – explainer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plans have been resisted by the major banks in submissions to Treasury.\nMichael Sukkar, the assistant minister to the treasurer, said the government did not want bank executives making short-term decisions that affected their remuneration, and Australians expected a high standard of decision-making when bankers were remunerated well.\n“Often those decisions are not in the best interests of the company in the long-term,” Sukkar told Sky News on Tuesday.\nLabor is still calling for a royal commission into the banking industry.\n The shadow minister for employment, Brendan O’Connor, told Sky News on Tuesday that not a week had gone by without another crisis hitting the banking sector.\n“This has gone on for far too long ... clearly, there are some systemic problems in the sector which can only be dealt with by a proper investigation with the power of the royal commission,” he said.\nwith Australian Associated Press\n",

        "text": "\nThe chancellor has asked UK enforcement agencies to look into whether British banking groups HSBC and Standard Chartered are linked to South Africa’s corruption inquiry into alleged ties between the wealthy Gupta family and President Jacob Zuma.\nAccording to letters seen by the Guardian, Philip Hammond has passed concerns raised by former Labour cabinet minister Peter Hain to the Serious Fraud Office (SFO), National Crime Agency (NCA) and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).\nLord Hain, who grew up in South Africa and became a prominent anti-apartheid activist, wrote to Hammond last month, warning that whistleblowers have told him that hundreds of millions of pounds has been siphoned out of the country via Hong Kong and Dubai.\nHe asked the chancellor to look into whether UK financial institutions may have been exposed to illicit funds owing to their significant presence in those financial centres.\nHe said banks including HSBC and Standard Chartered should review transactions involving individuals and companies linked to the Gupta family – entrepreneurs with businesses from coal mining to computers – and  Zuma. \nThe letters do not make any allegations of wrongdoing by the banks.\n\n\n Q&A Who are the Gupta brothers?  \n\n\n Show \n\n\n Hide  \n\n\nAjay, Atul and Rajesh Gupta are Indian-born entrepreneurs at the centre of a corruption investigation in South Africa.\nThe brothers, who moved to South Africa in 1993, have denied a string of allegations about alleged corruption. The key allegation levelled against them is that they have used their ties to Jacob Zuma, the country’s president, to advance their own business interests.\nThe scandal has already claimed the scalp of UK public relations firm Bell Pottinger. It went into administration after it was accused of deliberately stirring up racial tensions in South Africa while working for a Gupta holding company, Oakbay Investment.\n\n\n\n\nWas this helpful?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you for your feedback.\n\n\n\n\nZuma and the Guptas are the focus of an ongoing corruption inquiry in South Africa into allegations, denied by both sides, that their relationship gave the family undue influence on politics that benefited them financially.\nThe affair has already claimed the scalp of UK public relations firm Bell Pottinger, which counted Gupta holding company Oakbay Investments as a client and saw its business collapse when it was struck off by the UK PR industry body for its work with Oakbay. The South African bosses of accounting firm KPMG, which audited Gupta family businesses, also quit amid fallout from the affair.\nResponding to Hain’s letter, the chancellor said he had referred his concerns to the SFO, FCA and NCA and had also asked his officials to discuss the matter with the UK High Commission in South Africa.\n“The UK government takes allegations of corruption and money laundering extremely seriously and is committed to preventing the proceeds of corruption from entering the UK financial system,” he said.\nIn a statement, the Treasury said: “The government takes such allegations seriously and that’s why the letter has been passed on to appropriate authorities. It’s now for the authorities to determine what action to take.”\nA spokesperson for the FCA said it was “already in contact with both banks named and will consider carefully further responses received”.\nHain is expected to follow up his letter with a question in the House of Lords on Thursday asking for an update on the chancellor’s progress on the matter.\nSpeaking to the Guardian, he said: “As a former anti-apartheid activist, whose parents were jailed and exiled from South Africa, I feel deeply pained by the betrayal of values of the freedom struggle that is occurring under the political leadership and its business cronies in South Africa today.”\nHe said he was not accusing British banks of complicity in money-laundering but wanted them to help recoup any funds that have left the country by illicit means.\nHe pointed to court filings by South African finance minister Pravin Gordhan about 6.8bn ZAR (£380m) in transactions involving the Guptas that were reported to South African anti-money laundering regulators.\n“What I’ve asked the chancellor to do, and he’s agreed, is to have this investigated so that the necessary authorities can be notified. I hope that any stolen money will be identified and returned.”\nThe Guardian has contacted HSBC, Standard Chartered, the Guptas and President Jacob Zuma for comment.\n",

        "text": "\nDaphne Caruana Galizia’s last blog was characteristically trenchant, pithy and, unfortunately, more prescient for her than she could imagine. She had warned: “There are crooks everywhere you look now. The situation is desperate.” Less than half an hour later, a huge bomb ripped through the white Peugeot 108 rental car she had been driving, killing her instantly on a quiet country lane near her home in Malta. It is not special pleading to point out that journalists and journalism are facing extraordinary challenges: Mrs Caruana Galizia is the 10th journalist worldwide to die this year – and the second in Europe – in pursuit of finding the truth. The assassination of an investigative journalist, one who had unearthed serious allegations of money laundering and corruption in Malta, a European Union state, speaks volumes about the threat to freedom of speech in that country and the atmosphere of impunity and violence that has taken hold in the Mediterranean archipelago. As her son Matthew put it, “she stood between the rule of law and those who sought to violate it”. Her bravery cost her her life. It should not be lost in vain.\nMrs Caruana Galizia was a fearless reporter, taking on the rich and the powerful. A “one-woman WikiLeaks”, she led the Panama Papers investigation into corruption in Malta. Her death must be properly investigated – local police already appear to be unsympathetic. Mrs Caruana Galizia’s most recent revelations pointed the finger at Malta’s prime minister, Joseph Muscat, and two of his closest aides, connecting offshore companies linked to the three men with the sale of Maltese passports and hundreds of thousands of euros in payments from the government of Azerbaijan. Despite a judicial inquiry into the allegations, Mr Muscat won a snap poll this summer.\nWhat is striking about Mrs Caruana Galizia’s reporting is how rotten the state of Malta appears. The EU’s smallest country, with a population of around 420,000, Malta held the rotating European Union presidency until earlier this year. It has been labelled an EU “pirate tax haven”, helping multinationals avoid paying €14bn. A darker side is the 15 mafia-style shootings and bombings that have punctuated its last decade. Its main industries have been infiltrated by crime gangs. Earlier this month Europol detailed how the Calabrian organised crime syndicate, the ’Ndrangheta, ran a €2bn money-laundering operation through Maltese online betting companies. Internet gambling companies account for 10% of the island’s GDP. But Malta’s big money-spinner has been selling EU passports to the rich. More than 900 bought citizenship in 2016, which at €650,000 a pop means that they contributed nearly 16% of Malta’s budget revenues. Since many were taken up by Eurasian oligarchs, one can understand the accusation that Mrs Caruana Galizia was up against not a democracy but a mafia state.\nThe charge is that Malta is turning into a state run by, and resembling, organised crime – which does not govern but disposes of positions, wealth and troublesome persons. Malta cannot be a sham EU state where elections, the rule of law and the courts are just for show. The continent’s citizens accept EU governance because every member state is a functioning democracy. When one of its own backslides on democratic commitments, when a life is lost in the pursuit of truth, then the EU must take action.\n",

        "text": "\nWhat is the Azerbaijani Laundromat?\nA scheme to curry influence, pay lobbyists, apologists and European politicians and to launder cash. The $2.9bn (£2.2bn) operation ran between 2012 and 2014 – meaning that on average $3m was channelled out of Azerbaijan every day. The source of money isn’t always clear, but it comes from companies linked to Azerbaijan’s president, Ilham Aliyev, state ministries and the International Bank of Azerbaijan, the country’s largest bank, which recently filed for bankruptcy protection. The cash was transferred into four offshore-managed UK companies. From there, it was spent in various countries, including Germany, the UK, France, Turkey, Iran and Kazakhstan.\n\n\n\n\nUK at centre of secret $3bn Azerbaijani money laundering and lobbying scheme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow was it done? \nBy clever use of the west’s financial system. Danske, Denmark’s largest bank, handled the payments via a small branch office in Estonia. It noticed nothing amiss. The organisers of the scheme exploited Britain’s weakly regulated company system. They registered four firms at Companies House in London. These were Hilux Services, Polux Management, Metastar Invest and LCM Alliance. The first two were incorporated in Glasgow, the third in Birmingham and the fourth in Hertfordshire. The beneficial owner of the firms is a secret.\nWhy Scotland?\nTwo of the firms used in the Azerbaijani Laundromat were Scottish limited partnerships, known as SLPs. There is evidence that money launderers are using SLPs for international fraud. The companies have all the advantages of a regular firm: they have a “legal personality” and can open bank accounts. They are also entirely non-transparent. If they do their business abroad they don’t have to file returns or pay UK tax. No names of real people appear on the Companies House record. Instead, shadowy offshore agents in the British Virgin Islands “manage” Hilux and Polux.\n\nAzerbaijani Laundromat - how it works\n\nIs the government doing anything about this?\nYes, belatedly. In June the government brought in new laws forcing SLPs to reveal their real or beneficial owners or pay daily fines of up to £500. The move followed concerns that overseas criminals were piling into SLPs for the purposes of money laundering. According to Transparency International, between 2007 and 2016 the number of SLPs grew more than fourfold. They appear to be part of an offshore criminal network.\nWho were the beneficiaries?\nSeveral prominent Europeans. One of them is Luca Volontè, the Italian former chair of the centre-right European People’s party group in the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe (Pace). Volontè was among Pace delegates who controversially voted against a 2013 report criticising Azerbaijan’s human rights record. The leaked data shows he received more than €2m (£1.8m). He has been indicted in Italy for money laundering and corruption amid an investigation of what has been dubbed “caviar diplomacy”. He denies wrongdoing.\nOther high-profile beneficiaries include Eduard Lintner, a former German MP with the Christian Social Union, the Bavarian sister party to Angela Merkel’s ruling Christian Democrats. Between 2012 and 2014, when he was no longer an MP, his foundation received €819,500. The cash included a €61,000 payment made two weeks after Lintner visited Azerbaijan as an election observer. He praised the poll as up to “German standards”. He says the payments were for legitimate work, and that he did not personally benefit from the money or know about the original source of funds.\nCash was also sent to Bulgarian and Swiss bank accounts belonging to Kalin Mitrev, who was then a private consultant, but now works for the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in London. Mitrev says the money was private income from legitimate consultancy work and that he was not aware of the original source of the funds. He denies doing anything wrong. \nWhat about Azerbaijanis?\nMost of the beneficiaries are from Baku, Azerbaijan’s capital. They include a diplomat at the Azerbaijani embassy in London, Orkhan Sultanov, who has reportedly been named as the country’s foreign intelligence chief, and Jovdat Guliyev, a leading figure in the Anglo-Azerbaijani Society. There is no suggestion they were aware of the original source of the money. There are payments to well-connected regime children studying in Britain or taking English language courses. One of Baku’s most powerful political families is linked to the fund via a French company, RCL Holding. Ziya Mammadov, an ex-transport minister, his son Anar, and other relatives have a multibillion-dollar fortune in Azerbaijan. It includes construction, hotels and insurance companies. The Mammadovs were once investors in Trump Tower in Baku, a development that was never finished. There are payments in the data to entities related to the Mammadovs’ Baghlan Group. The scheme doesn’t link to Trump but does raise questions about the president’s choice of business partners.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  The Trump Tower in Baku. Donald Trump’s business partners in the project – the Mammadovs – also appear in the Laundromat scheme. Photograph: NurPhoto via Getty Images\n\n\nHow do we know if this is money laundering?\nDanske admits that controls at its Estonian branch to detect and stop money laundering were not good enough. It discovered the scheme in 2014. The bank says it has reported suspicious transactions to the authorities, and it is up to them to determine whether and to what extent these were made for illegal purposes.  \nAdditionally, the suspicious nature of some of the source transactions rings alarm bells. One firm – Baktelekom MMC – paid more than $1.4bn into the bank accounts. The company has the same name as Azerbaijan’s telecoms provider but is unrelated. It makes enormous transfers two or three times a day, with money funnelled back and forth between companies. Offshore experts say this pattern combined with the sheer “velocity” of the transactions should have raised red flags.\nWhere does the data come from?\nAn anonymous source leaked the data to the Danish newspaper Berlingske in Copenhagen. The paper shared it with the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), the Guardian, and other media partners. There are details of more than 16,000 transactions, including names of beneficiaries, bank payment details, and amounts in various currencies. \n",

        "text": "\nThe Australian Bankers’ Association has attacked the Turnbull government’s proposed bank accountability rules, claiming they could expose chief executives to class actions led by customers who want to make their grievances “personal”.\nAidan O’Shaughnessy, the ABA’s executive director, has warned the Coalition’s bid to make more bankers accountable could also make it harder for financial institutions to attract talent.\nThe treasurer, Scott Morrison, recently released draft legislation for the government’s new Banking Executive Accountability Regime (Bear), which will give the banking regulator, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, greater power to crack down on banks.\n\n\n\n\nWhy we need to see Commonwealth Bank directors in the witness box | Geoffrey Gibson\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe gave the industry just one week to respond to the draft legislation, although he had floated the plans in his May budget.\nThe move has been resisted by the major banks but Malcolm Turnbull has said he will push ahead regardless, in light of the latest money-laundering allegations engulfing the Commonwealth Bank.\nUnder the proposed Bear regime, the government would give Apra power to cap salaries of senior bank executives and delay their bonuses by years, to prevent bonuses being paid all in one hit.\nThe regulator would also be given power to push directors out of the industry for bad behaviour and to force all senior banking executives to register so it could keep records of their behaviour.\nO’Shaughnessy has stridently criticised the draft legislation and the one-week response time demanded by Morrison.\n“Given industry support for responsible reform it is most regrettable that only one week has been allowed to comment on the complexities of the exposure draft bill and draft explanatory memorandum, this cannot be the acceptable standard for Australian public service policy design and development envisaged by the prime minister and cabinet,” O’Shaughnessy said in the ABA’s submission.\n“In the short time made available, ABA have limited opportunity to fully consider the implications of the exposure draft bill.”\nHe warned the draft legislation had multiple problems. First, he said Apra would be given far too much power under the new regime and said the government needed to ensure Apra was subject to appropriate checks and balances.\n“The ABA is deeply concerned by the lack of guidance given to Apra in exercising its power to disqualify accountable persons and the lack of checks and balances in the Bear around Apra’s powers to deregister, remove or disqualify an individual,” he said.\n“We are also concerned that there may be a fundamental reversal of the onus of proof regarding a breach of the Bear expectations, contrary to Australian judicial principles.\nSecond, O’Shaughnessy said the new rules could expose bank chief executives to class actions.\n“One can readily foresee that with this regulatory strengthening comes a real possibility that class actions and other civil litigation will be commenced against accountable persons … in relation to breaches or potential breaches of their Bear obligations,” he said.\n“The ABA is concerned that unmeritorious proceedings could be commenced personally against, for example, chief executive officers of banks in order to make issues or grievances ‘personal’.”\nThird, he criticised the draft legislation for failing to define who an “accountable person” would be in the event of a breach of the Bear regime. \n\n\n\n\nNick Xenophon: bank CEOs should face jail if found guilty of money laundering\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said “accountable persons” must be able to influence or impact the whole, or substantial part of, an authorised deposit-taking institution and its subsidiaries as a consolidated group.\n“The Bear should be limited to the most senior executives only,” he said.\nMorrison has said the new regulatory regime would apply from 1 July 2018 but the ABA says that does not give the industry much time.\n“The Bear should have an implementation date that is the earlier of 1 January 2019, or one year from the finalisation of the legislation,” O’Shaughnessy said.\n",

        "text": "\nLast September Mohammad Rahman won a four-year battle for compensation for disabilities caused by clinical negligence. A court awarded him £500,000, which was paid into the current and savings accounts he held with Barclays. The victory was short-lived: when he withdrew £60,000 of the payout, Barclays froze both accounts.\nIn vain did Rahman (not his real name) supply evidence that the payment was legal. Two months later Barclays confiscated the remaining £440,000 and closed his accounts. It then charged him £24 in fees when, because of its actions, three payments failed. “I have been treated like a criminal,” says the 26-year-old from Manchester, who has spent more than 30 hours at his local branch trying to gain access to his money. “In all this time I have not received a single letter or phone call explaining what has happened.”\nRahman is one of a growing number of customers who have had their bank accounts closed without warning or explanation. In the past two years the Observer has been contacted by bewildered readers of all backgrounds – including an economics professor, a migraine charity, a prominent campaign group and numerous ordinary householders whose finances involve nothing more exotic than a holiday in Spain.\n\n\n\n\nOne family's nightmare as fraudsters ransack Barclays account by phone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMany have fallen foul of a legal clamp down on financial crime after several banks were fined for fraud. Under the EU Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive 2015, banks are obliged to vet accounts for possible money-laundering on behalf of terror or crime cartels. The result is they have been dumping accounts with links to certain countries or that show unexpected transactions. It’s a process known as de-risking and Rahman’s sudden windfall would have set alarm bells ringing.\nInevitably, like Rahman, many victims are of Asian or African origin, as is clear from the correspondence to the Observer. It follows that because countries deemed high risk in terms of terror and money laundering tend to be Asian and African, people from these areas may be particularly vulnerable.\nThe Financial Conduct Authority has warned of potential discrimination as banks run scared of the rules. “De-risking is banks acting in a blanket way … it will make potentially significant parts of geographic, ethnic and business classes unbanked if allowed to continue,” the FCA’s chief executive told MPs in 2015.\nThe Financial Ombudsman Service, which handles unresolved customer complaints, categorises all cases under the financial product in question, such as current accounts, rather than the nature of the issue, so it can’t tell whether complaints about closures are on the rise or whether certain ethnic groups are disproportionately affected.\nBarclays insists its customers’ ethnicity does not make them more vulnerable, and that it’s their lifestyle and spending patterns rather than their name that is monitored by security algorithms. “Customers making and receiving genuine transactions have absolutely nothing to fear,” a spokesperson says. “Criminals attempting to commit fraud and launder funds should rightly be worried as all banks and regulators will detect, disrupt and prevent their activity.”\nExcept Rahman is not a criminal and has spent three months without access to his money. He might still be without it if the Observer had not intervened shortly before Christmas.\nBarclays initial response was staggering. “We took the appropriate action that customers would expect from us when an unusual transaction has been received,” it said in a statement. “On this occasion we are satisfied the transaction was genuine and we are happy to return the funds to our customer.”\n\n\n\n\nBarclays blocked ‘fraudulent’ cheques, but where’s the money gone?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt should have realised the transaction was genuine in early October when Rahman provided the requested evidence. It should have realised after the dozen 80-minute round journeys he made to his branch in Bury and the hours spent on the phone to prove himself.\nInstead it send him on a wild goose chase between departments, all of which gave him contradictory information before falling silent. “After my account was closed, I was told that my solicitors’ bank would have to send an electronic swift message confirming that the money it had deposited was legal and I was the intended beneficiary,” he says.\n“The solicitors’ bank, NatWest, said it could only do this if Barclays instigated a request, which Barclays refused to do. Instead, when NatWest contacted Barclays, Barclays stated that the money had been transferred elsewhere by me and that it had not debited my account or requested further information.”\nDespite its blithe statement, and only after media contact, Barclays realises it has made a catastrophic error and at the end of December it offered Rahman £7,558.30 to reflect loss of interest and benefits, and £250 for “distress and inconvenience”.\nIt promised to reopen his account within four days and to issue an instant over-the-counter debit card so he could access his money over Christmas. Four days later the account did indeed reopen, but Rahman made two lengthy commutes in vain to collect the promised debit card. First he was told fraud markers were showing on his account, and then that he needed a new pin, which had to be sent by post.\nBarclays now accepts that, according to a spokesperson, “the original investigation was poorly managed, and our decision to close the account incorrect”.\nIt says the case has been flagged up to senior managers “to ensure situations of this kind are not repeated”. It has now increased its offer to Rahmen to £8,323.69 for lost interest and returns and £750 for the “inconvenience”.\nThe Financial Services Consumer Panel, a statutory body which represents consumer interests in financial policy-making, says the law needs to be changed to prevent such conflicts of interest between banks and customers.\n\n\n\n\n \n\nBarclays can behave as though it has no duty of care to this customer because, in law, it has none\n\nCaroline Barr, financial expert\n\n\n\n“Barclays can behave as though it has no duty of care towards this customer because, in law, it has none,” says panel member Caroline Barr. “The Financial Services and Markets Act says firms should ‘treat customers fairly’. The panel believes the Act should be amended to specify what constitutes a ‘reasonable’ duty of care to ensure banks act in the best interests of their customers. This case highlights the disastrous consequences when they don’t.”\nRahman, who was left without use of his right arm after errors made during his birth, had been about to purchase a buy-to-let property when his account was frozen. Because of Barclay’s incompetence he lost out on the house.\n“I have recently finished a master’s in architecture, but have been unable to start looking for a job because of the stress and the hours spent in the branch and on the phone,” he says.\n“The court settlement was supposed to make life easier for me given that my disability restricts my movement and causes me constant pain, but it’s had the opposite effect because of the hell Barclays have put me through.”\nKNOW YOUR RIGHTS\nBanks are closing customer accounts in increasing volumes, according to a Financial Conduct Authority investigation, and they are under no obligation to explain why.\nMost include in their terms and conditions the proviso that they can end a relationship with a customer, while FCA rules merely require that sufficient notice is given. However, if criminal behaviour is suspected, facilities can be legally withdrawn.\nGovernment regulations oblige banks to monitor customers’ accounts for potential money laundering or financial crime, and any uncharacteristic transactions can trigger fraud filters. These filters flag up connections with, or payments from, countries deemed risky, and under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 banks are not allowed to “tip off” a customer that an investigation may be underway.\nNor do customers have the right to hear the results of any investigation. The consequences for innocent victims can be devastating, for once a name appears on a fraud database it can prove impossible to open another bank account elsewhere.\nWhat banks often fail to tell customers is that they have the right to request any information held about them on the national fraud database operated by fraud prevention service CIFAS. This is known as a “subject access request” and costs £10. They can then appeal through CIFAS if they dispute the data.\nThe Financial Ombudsman Service will also investigate complaints about frozen or closed accounts, but it can only ensure that a service was withdrawn in accordance with the bank’s terms and conditions. If it wasn’t, it can’t do more than require that the bank pay compensation for the inconvenience and make good any consequential losses.\nIt has no power to insist the account is reinstated. And although it can require the bank to provide evidence of any illegal activity, it can’t always share that with the customer.\nThe FCA last year announced that it is seeking to improve the way banks identify risky accounts and how they communicate with their customers.\n",

        "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/dec/01/panama-papers-europol-links-3500-names-to-suspected-criminals",
        "text": "\nAlmost 3,500 individuals and companies in the Panama Papers are probable matches for suspected criminals including terrorists, cybercriminals and cigarette smugglers, according to a document seen by the Guardian.\nThe analysis, which was carried out by Europol, the EU’s law enforcement agency, sheds more light on the breadth of criminal behaviour facilitated by tax havens around the world. \n“The main point here is that we can link companies from the Panama Papers leaks not only with economic crimes, like money laundering or VAT carousels, but also with terrorism and Russian organised crime groups,” Simon Riondet, head of financial intelligence at Europol, told a committee of MEPs.\nThe Panama Papers, leaked files from the offshore services company Mossack Fonseca, revealed that hundreds of the world’s wealthiest and most powerful individuals had used offshore companies to hide their riches.\nWhile the use of offshore structures is legal, critics have long alleged that they can also be used to facilitate improper or unlawful behaviour. \nThe memo was prepared for a European parliamentary committee investigating how the offshore world can be used to facilitate tax abuse and international crime.\nAccording to the memo, Europol compared a publicly available version of the Panama Papers published by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists with its own databases of individuals and companies suspected of criminal involvement and identified 3,469 probable matches .\nIt matched 1,722 names in the Panama Papers with entities that had been reported by EU member states as having been involved in potential money-laundering transactions. The majority of matches originated from the UK, although the memo cautioned that this was probably due to the country’s status as Europe’s pre-eminent financial centre.\nOf the rest, among others, a further 516 of the matches were connected to eastern European organised criminal gangs, 388 were connected to VAT fraud operations, and 260 to cigarette smuggling operations. It said 116 of the names were connected to “Hydra” – a Europol codeword for Islamist terrorism, according to the document – while 99 related to “Cola”, or drug crime.\nOne of the “main schemes” identified by the Europol analysis of the Panama Papers involves the abuse of trusts – legal arrangements whereby the owner of an asset places it under the control of another individual or company – by criminals seeking to obscure their assets.\nThe document identifies “the use of corporate service providers by criminals to acquire large numbers of shell companies (including finding third parties for positions within the company) located in offshore/tax havens (usually under the form of holding companies or trusts)” as one such scheme.\nThat analysis stands in stark contrast with a 2013 letter by David Cameron to the then president of the European council, in which he argued for trusts to be excluded from new transparency measures that would affect offshore companies.\n“As we clamp down on the misuse of companies, we must take care not to displace illicit activity elsewhere,” the then prime minister wrote, adding later in the letter: “It is clearly important we recognise the important differences between companies and trusts. This means that the solution for addressing the potential misuse of companies – such as a central public registries – may well not be appropriate generally.”\nSeparately to its analysis of the Panama Papers, the Europol briefing also suggests that Luxembourg, widely known as a major tax haven for multinational corporations, is also failing to tackle money-laundering offences.\n“Reporting figures across the EU do not always appear to be commensurate with the activities of the regulated sector in particular jurisdictions: notably Cyprus and Malta and Luxembourg receive very few reports given the significance of these jurisdictions in offshore financial service and the online gambling industry,” the memo reads.\n“Furthermore, the vast majority of reports filed with Luxembourg stem from a single electronic bank/payment service provider, in spite of the fact that other sectors, such as private banking and offshore financial services, offer significant scope for money-laundering activities and tax crimes.”\nEuropol declined to comment.\nSeparately, Giovanni Kessler, the director general of OLAF, the European anti-fraud office, told the MEPs his agency had opened four investigations into potential cases of fraud against the European Union “on the basis of an analysis of information related to the Panama Papers and of information obtained from other sources”.\n",

        "text": "\nBonuses for supposedly “exceptional” performance are still routine among Australia’s top corporate bosses, despite their average pay packets remaining flat since the global financial crisis, new figures show.\nChief executives of Australia’s biggest listed companies are more likely to get fired than not receive a bonus – 86% pocketed one in 2016 according to a report by the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors.\nDomino’s Pizza boss Don Meij was the third highest-paid chief executive in Australia on $21m, a “remarkable” result given his reported salary was $4m, the report said.\n\n\n\n\nCommonwealth Bank axes executive bonuses over money-laundering scandal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeij’s windfall came from cashing in options on the back of a share price surge that came to a screaming halt this month when Domino’s missed profit targets, and following months of publicity about problems in its franchises including claims of multimillion-dollar underpayments.\nThe averaged “realised” pay among ASX 100 chief executives in 2016 was $5.7m, which was 93 times the average Australian earnings as of last November.\nComparative data about gender pay equality in top corporate ranks was impossible since “sadly the pool of female CEOs” in the biggest 200 listed companies – nine women – was too small for meaningful analysis, ASCI noted.\n\ntop 10\n\nFixed pay before bonuses rose slightly over the year but was the same as nine years ago, which reflected investor pressure for boards to keep executive pay in check, according to ASCI.\nThis included through the “two-strikes” rule that since 2011 allows shareholders to push for a board spill if pay proposals are twice disapproved.\nHowever, ACSI’s chief executive, Louise Davidson, said the prevalence of big bonuses was the ongoing concern for investors and raised “serious questions about the way performance hurdles are being designed and applied”.\n“Investors reasonably assume that bonuses will only be awarded for exceptional performance, over and above normal expectations,” she said.\nBut the median payout for bonuses was 69% of their maximum, with only 18 chief executives in the ASX 100 getting less than half their maximum. \nThis showed chief executive bonuses bore little relation to performance in many companies, Davidson said.\nJulie Walker, associate professor of accounting at the University of Queensland, said while shareholder scrutiny had a role in heading off runaway executive pays, “economic influences such as historic low wages growth for Australian workers had also had an influence”. \n“It’s difficult to justify large executive pay rises when average worker earnings are stagnating,” she said.\nWalker agreed that executive bonuses “still seem ‘too easy’ to achieve”.\n“And it does beg the question of whether bonuses have been substituted for fixed pay to some extent, given the downward pressure on CEO fixed salaries,” she said.\nWalker noted that “equity rewards” as company share packages for chief executives had increased in 2016. “It seems that low wages growth for the average Australian worker is only partly paralleled in Australian executive pay packets,” she said.\nThe biggest chief executive salary was shared by shopping centre mavens Peter and Steven Lowy of Westfield Corporation, at $26.2m.\nThey were followed by Macquarie Bank’s Nicholas Moore with $25m, while Louis Gries of James Hardie was fourth with just $10,000 less than Meij. \nDavidson said ASCI welcomed recent examples of boards scrapping bonuses, for example the Commonwealth Bank as a result of its money-laundering scandal.\n\n\n\n\nReserve Bank chief warns rising inequality could erode political centre\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“However, we can’t help wondering why these executives would have qualified for any payments in the first place,” she said.\nCompanies needed to better explain why bonuses were given and that they were “fair and reasonable, having regard to company performance”, Davidson said.\nCommonwealth Bank’s Ian Narev, who has announced he will quit next year as the fallout from the scandal continues, was the eighth best paid chief executive last year with $12.2m.\nBHP’s Andrew McKenzie was among the 10 best paid CEOs in terms of reported salary, but not “realised” pay after he gave up his bonuses after the Samarco dam disaster in Brazil that killed 19 people in 2015.\n\n",

        "text": "\nEven in an age inured to corruption, the infamous reign of Sepp Blatter over football’s global ruling body, Fifa, was jaw-droppingly spectacular. For 40 years, from joining as technical director in 1975 until his dramatic resignation as president in 2015, he built an organisation from a squad of a dozen staffers into an international powerhouse that he ran with an iron hand. How did he do it? David Conn’s patient unravelling of Fifa’s tangled web provides the answer, and it makes for ugly but revealing reading. Blatter presided over a culture of kickbacks, money laundering and tax dodges that made Fifa a byword for crookery long before he was forced from his job. Conn, a sports journalist on the Guardian, negotiates the murky world of big money with confidence and dogged calm in this tale of the beautiful game gone bad.\n• The Fall of the House of Fifa by David Conn is published by Yellow Jersey (£16.99).

        "text": "\nDavid Cameron has accused Donald Trump of undermining democracy by attacking the media, saying the true threat posed by fake news lay with Vladimir Putin, his twitter bots and Russian efforts to use corruption as a weapon of foreign policy.\nThe former British prime minister also accused Russia of winning the right to stage the 2018 Fifa World Cup via corruption.\nGiving his first British public lecture since his resignation in the wake of the Brexit referendum defeat in 2016, Cameron also defended multilateral institutions such as the European Union, warning isolationism driven by anti-globalisation endangered the world’s security.\nGiving a lecture in London to Transparency International, he said: “Just as with all our biggest challenges – on trade, on terrorism, on climate change, on global poverty – we need to work with other nations if we want change. We cannot do this alone.”\n\n\n Quick guide What you need to know about the Trump-Russia inquiry  \n\n\n Show \n\n\n Hide  \n\n\n\nHow serious are the allegations?\n\nThe story of Donald Trump and Russia comes down to this: a sitting president or his campaign is suspected of having coordinated with a foreign country to manipulate a US election. The story could not be bigger, and the stakes for Trump – and the country – could not be higher.\n\n\n\nWhat are the key questions?\n\nInvestigators are asking two basic questions: did Trump’s presidential campaign collude at any level with Russian operatives to sway the 2016 US presidential election? And did Trump or others break the law to throw investigators off the trail?\n\n\n\nWhat does the country think?\n\nWhile a majority of the American public now believes that Russia tried to disrupt the US election, opinions about Trump campaign involvement tend to split along partisan lines: 73% of Republicans, but only 13% of Democrats, believe Trump did “nothing wrong” in his dealings with Russia and its president, Vladimir Putin.\n\n\n\nWhat are the implications for Trump?\n\nThe affair has the potential to eject Trump from office. Experienced legal observers believe that prosecutors are investigating whether Trump committed an obstruction of justice. Both Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton – the only presidents to face impeachment proceedings in the last century – were accused of obstruction of justice. But Trump’s fate is probably up to the voters. Even if strong evidence of wrongdoing by him or his cohort emerged, a Republican congressional majority would probably block any action to remove him from office. (Such an action would be a historical rarity.)\n\n\n\nWhat has happened so far?\n\nFormer foreign policy adviser George Papadopolous pleaded guilty to perjury over his contacts with Russians linked to the Kremlin, and the president’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort and another aide face charges of money laundering.\n\n\n\nWhen will the inquiry come to an end?\n\nThe investigations have an open timeline.\n\n\n\n\n\nWas this helpful?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you for your feedback.\n\n\n\n\nCameron warned that Trump’s attacks on news organisations such as CNN and the BBC were not just tactically wrong but dangerous. He accused the US president of “an attempt to question the whole legitimacy of organisations that have an important role in our democracy”.\nCameron said: “Let me put it like this: President Trump, ‘fake news’ is not broadcasters criticising you, it’s Russian bots and trolls targeting your democracy pumping out untrue stories day after day, night after night.\n“When you misappropriate the term ‘fake news’, you are deflecting attention from real abuses. Ignoring what’s happening on social media is facilitating a form of corruption that is undermining democracy.”\n He then directly challenged the way in which Russia won the right to stage the 2018 World Cup describing the event as a fiasco.\n“President Putin actually boycotted the whole thing because he said it was riddled with corruption,” Cameron said. “He was right – it was.”\n Adding he was putting it as diplomatically as he could, he said: “I am sure he wasn’t completely surprised when Russia actually won the bid. You couldn’t make it up. In the years since, 10 of the 22 members of that Fifa executive committee were indicted or punished.”\n Cameron made the global fight against corruption one of the themes of his premiership, and it was the major issue of his chairmanship of the G8 in 2015. He also staged a corruption summit in 2016 at which world leaders made a series of pledges to clamp down on money laundering and kleptocracy.\nIn his lecture he defended his record as premier, saying he persuaded British Overseas Territories, often seen as tax havens, to set up central registers of beneficial ownership that were open to law enforcement agencies. In the UK he introduced a public register on beneficial ownership. But legislation promised by Cameron in 2015 on a public register of foreign companies owning property in the UK or seeking public sector contracts has been delayed, with the government promising this week to introduce a draft law in this parliamentary session.\nOverall, No 10 has not given the impression of wanting to give global leadership on the issue and Cameron pointedly referred to his corruption summit as the high water mark of UK government action.\nHe warned that the fight against corruption needed international cooperation and institutions to succeed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Donald Trump has repeatedly attacked news organisations such as CNN – both during his presidency and during his campaign. Photograph: Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\nReturning to some of the themes that lost him his premiership, he insisted: “I am not some starry-eyed Davos-devotee who thinks there is nothing wrong with globalisation. Of course we need to help those left behind economically, with better skills, more apprenticeships and higher minimum wages. And we cannot ignore those who feel left behind culturally; whether by immigration that has been too high, or by international organisations – yes, including the European Union – that have been too high handed.”\n But he urged: “Don’t throw the baby out with the bathwater, including market economics, institutions with rules and openness to the world. These are things that make us strong.\n“The things the wave of anti-globalisation is in danger of ushering in – isolationism, protectionism, unilateralism – endanger our countries and our world. And they particularly threaten the fight against corruption.\n“The cancer of corruption is developing, metastasising and becoming more commonplace, more complex, more multi-layered, elusive and ingrained,” he said, adding that the best antidote was “transparency, real democracy and accountability”.\n",

        "text": "\nBitcoin has taken a step toward legitimacy with the launch of a product on a Chicago exchange that allows investors to take bets on its price in the future.\nThe new contract on the Chicago Board Options Exchange came as the digital currency jumped another 10%, sparking fresh warnings of a speculative bubble after last week’s 40% climb in price.\nBitcoin was trading at $16,200 – up 10% on the day – while the new futures contract trading in Chicago showed that traders were expecting the cryptocurrency to be trading at even higher prices in January.\nThe futures contract trading on the CBOE allows traders to take bets – or to protect themselves – on the price of bitcoin next month. It started trading just before midnight (in London) on Sunday at $15,460, hit a high of $18,700 and then dropped back to $17,800.\nSuch was the price volatility when the contract launched that trading had to be halted twice through so-called circuit breakers and the CBOE had to admit that its website was creaking because of the heavy traffic although its trading platform kept working.\n\n\nCboe \n(@CBOE)\nDue to heavy traffic on our website, visitors to https://t.co/jb3O722hoo may find that it is performing slower than usual and may at times be temporarily unavailable. All trading systems are operating normally.\n\nDecember 10, 2017\n\n\nThe launch of the contract on a regulated exchange is regarded as a sign that bitcoin is becoming more mainstream rather than currency associated with technology experts and even criminals.\nDaniele Bianchi, assistant professor of finance at Warwick Business School, said: “Although it has been thought of as a peer-to-peer payment system, it is evident that bitcoin is gaining more and more legitimacy as an asset class. Today’s launch of bitcoin futures has the potential to add further momentum and thus increase the appeal of the cryptocurrency to both institutional and retail investors.”\n Volume in the futures contract was low: according to calculations by Breakingviews, it was roughly $50m (£37m), less than 0.5% of actual bitcoins. \nBitcoin – created in the aftermath of the financial crisis as a way to avoid using banks – started the year trading at $966 and its meteoric rise this year has led to comparisons with the dotcom bubble in 2000 and the 17th century tulip bubble.\n\n\n Q&A What is bitcoin and is it a bad investment?  \n\n\n Show \n\n\n Hide  \n\n\nBitcoin is the first, and the biggest, \"cryptocurrency\" – a decentralised tradable digital asset. Whether it is a bad investment is the big question. Bitcoin can only be used as a medium of exchange and in practice has been far more important for the dark economy than it has for most legitimate uses. The lack of any central authority makes bitcoin remarkably resilient to censorship, corruption – or regulation. That means it has attracted a range of backers, from libertarian monetarists who enjoy the idea of a currency with no inflation and no central bank, to drug dealers who like the fact that it is hard (but not impossible) to trace a bitcoin transaction back to a physical person.\n\n\n\n\nWas this helpful?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you for your feedback.\n\n\n\n\nOne of a number of cryptocurrencies, bitcoin is not regulated and is controlled by a network of computers that update all transactions which take place on a variety of trading platforms around the world. It only exists digitally and is “mined” using mathematical equations.\nBut on Monday, a top central banker said the European Union should look at the possibility of regulating bitcoin because of the risk of money laundering. Speaking in Vienna, Ewald Nowotny, said: “Simply because of the scale, it is certainly increasingly necessary to discuss whether and in what form regulations are needed here.”\n Nowotny, Austria’s central bank governor and also involved in setting interest rates at the European Central Bank, added: “A particular aspect that needs to be discussed ... is the question of how far the regulations on money laundering ... are relevant here.”\nHis remarks come after warnings from other senior bankers about the risks associated with bitcoin. Last week, Howard Davies, chairman of Royal Bank of Scotland, had said the sign should be put up from Dante’s Inferno – “Abandon hope all ye who enter here” – while Jamie Dimon, the head of JP Morgan, has talked about bitcoin as being worse than tulip mania and potentially used by “a drug dealer, a murderer, stuff like that”.\n\n\n Q&A What are futures?  \n\n\n Show \n\n\n Hide  \n\nThe latest surge of excitement in the world of crypto​​currencies came over the weekend when the Chicago Board Options Exchange launched futures trading for bitcoin for the first time.\nFutures contracts allow investors to agree to buy a certain amount of a commodity, bond or share at a specific price at a designated time in the future, hence the name. It means investors can bet on whether they believe a particular commodity – in this case bitcoin – will rise or fall by a specified future date. They are generally used in commodity markets to hedge against major fluctuations in prices, such as unexpected weather conditions hitting crops. But they are also well established in equity markets, with trading on individual companies and indices such as the FTSE 100 and S&P 500.\nThere are risks, mainly when investors use debt to finance their futures speculation and their bet goes the wrong way.\n\n\n\n\nWas this helpful?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you for your feedback.\n\n\n\n\nAs the new futures contract was launched, analysts at Swiss bank UBS said “cryptocurrencies are a bubble”. Paul Donovan, global chief economist at the Swiss bank’s asset management arm, said futures on tulip bubbles were launched in 1636. The tulip bubble did not burst until February 1637. \n“Bubbles are by definition irrational,” said Donovan. “Predicting when a bubble will burst cannot use rational analysis. Ignoring a bubble is the best course of action.” \nAbout 16m bitcoins have been mined so far but there will only be 21m in total because it is written into the currency at its source code. Another futures contract on another US exchange is due to launch next week.\n• Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.\n",

        "text": "\nAn established Conservative party strategy is to play the immigration card whenever it is in trouble. Today is no different. This time it is enrolling banks and building societies to carry out checks for illegal immigrants. Yes, the banks that crashed the economy and are still busy hiding more than $13tn of their liabilities are somehow expected to trawl through 70m accounts to find illegal immigrants.\n\n\n\n\nUK banks to check 70m bank accounts in search for illegal immigrants\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow will the financial sector identify illegal immigrants beyond doubt, assuming that they have opened bank accounts? Is there going to be racial profiling and stereotyping? Will banks be given access to government databases? And what protections will prevent abuse of privacy and commercial exploitation of the personal details of UK residents and some 40 million annual visitors to the country? The government has no idea of the number of illegal immigrants. Visa overstayers may leave a moderate paper trail, but here are no current statistics about the number of illegal immigrants.\nThe government’s own position is that “it is impossible to quantify accurately the number of people who are in the country illegally”. The Home Office itself does not have adequate systems or records. Recently it admitted having sent letters threatening to deport EU nationals legally present in the UK. If banks acted upon the government’s poor data and froze bank accounts, how much hardship would that cause?\nIt’s folly to rely on banks. They have an appalling record of compliance with any recognisable standards of decency and honesty. Look at any number of scandals – the Panama Papers, HSBC, Luxembourg leaks, and see how UK-based banks present themselves as engines of global tax avoidance/evasion, money laundering, bribery and corruption.\nIdentification of illegal immigrants will require the development of complex systems of internal controls. But banks lack good systems of controls for dealing with even their normal trade. Under the anti-money-laundering laws all banks are required to verify the identity of their clients. Yet how many human traffickers, slave traders and rogue landlords manage to process their gains through bank accounts? Numerous shell companies with no identifiable directors or shareholders are conduits for bribery, corruption and sanctions busting, but via functioning bank accounts.\n\n\n\n\n \n\nInvest in the public services to tackle gangmasters. Raid employers who run sweatshops\n\n\nPublic admonishment, fines and investigations should prompt banks to upgrade their systems, but that doesn’t seem to happen. Banks deal with money. Their moral compass and economic systems are not equipped to spot illegal immigrants. But more than that, illegality, at least when it comes to richer customers, is a source of profits. If the government really wants to tackle illegal immigration then it needs to invest in the public services to tackle the human traffickers, rogue landlords and gangmasters who bring illegal immigrants into the country. It needs to raid employers who run sweatshops and profit from the blood of innocent individuals, often paying them low wages.\nMinisters could get tough and enforce national minimum wage laws, prosecuting those who fail to meet their legal obligations. There have been only 13 successful prosecutions. The government is neither fair nor serious. This announcement is more proof of that.\n• Prem Sikka is emeritus professor of accounting at the University of Essex\n",

        "text": "\nBillions of pounds have been laundered through the City of London, despite Britain remaining one of the safest and cleanest places in the world to do business, the home secretary has said.\nAmber Rudd issued the warning as she announced plans for a new national economic crime centre, with the power to task the Serious Fraud Office to investigate the worst cases of fraud, money laundering and corruption.\nThe national economic crime centre will be based within the National Crime Agency and will oversee the national police response to financial crime, backed by greater intelligence and analytical capabilities.\nThe move, which will include naming a Home Office minister responsible for tackling economic crime, is part of a revised anti-corruption strategy published on Monday that targets “corrupt insiders” in sectors including policing, prisons and border force, and pledges greater transparency over who owns and controls businesses to improve trust in Britain as a place to do business.\nThe Guardian’s disclosure of the Panama Papers has already led to the creation of a government taskforce using the data to improve official understanding of the complex and opaque structures used to mask offshore tax evasion. The revised strategy document says that by October, a joint financial analysis centre had opened civil and criminal investigations into more than 66 individuals for suspected tax evasion.\nThe latest official figures suggest that £90bn a year in crime proceeds are laundered each year in Britain, including money from large-scale drug dealing and people trafficking. It is also estimated that fraud costs a further £6.8bn a year – the equivalent of £225 a household.\nThe home secretary said: “Today we are taking action against economic crime, and by that I mean the high-level crime, the billions that have been laundered through the City of London, making sure we reduce that and we are very clear we expect higher standards of integrity in this country.\n“But [it is] also about everyday economic crime that affects everybody. I don’t know a single person who doesn’t know somebody who knows somebody who has been the victim of some sort of online fraud. On those two elements, high-level economic crime and everyday economic crime, we’re taking action to make sure we reduce it in this country,” said Rudd.\nShe will personally chair a new economic crime strategy board to drive action and Conservative MP John Penrose has been appointed the “anti-corruption champion” by the prime minister.\nRudd stressed that economic crime was not victimless. \n\n\n\n\nJeremy Corbyn to take aim at tax avoidance in speech at UN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong the victims was Karen Mackie from Aldershot, Hampshire, who lost her solicitors practice and her home after she fell prey to a phishing scam whereby fraudsters pretending to be from her bank phoned and asked about an issue with her accounts.\nThe 56-year-old was told to hang up and ring the number on the back of her card, but the scammers had kept the line open and, in the belief she was through to the anti-fraud team at Natwest, did as she was instructed, transferring thousands of pounds into the criminals’ accounts.\n “I became quite ill afterwards as a result of it,” she said. “I lost my practice because my insurance wouldn’t pay out, as it turned out they were in financial difficulty. In other circumstances, the insurance company of the solicitors have paid out. We subsequently lost our home this year. The long-term effects just continue.”\nThe government’s new, more robust approach to money laundering, bribery and corruption includes new powers for the national economic crime centre to coordinate the private sector response as well as directly task the SFO. The revised strategy sets out six priorities, including: reducing the insider threat in high-risk domestic sectors; strengthening Britain as a financial centre; reducing corruption in public procurement and grants; and improving the business environment globally.\n“To secure our future prosperity, we must do all that we can to make sure that Britain remains one of the safest and cleanest places in the world to do business,” said Rudd. “Our security and prosperity are inextricably linked. As the UK prepares to leave the EU, we have an opportunity to leverage our reputation for integrity and fair play as we establish new trading relationships.”\n",

        "text": "\nExtending anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws to Australia’s legal profession would erode lawyer-client privilege and could cost the industry 10% of the entire revenue of the legal profession, the Law Council of Australia has claimed.\nThe federal government has been consulting with industry groups about extending Australia’s anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism laws to different industry groups.\nThe consultation is focused on expanding the types of industries required to report suspicious matters, undertake certain types of due diligence requirements and verify identification now limited to certain types of financial institutions.\nThe range of bodies that could be affected by the changes includes real estate agents, lawyers, car dealers and accountants.\nThe Attorney General’s Department has published a series of submissions from various industry bodies, some of which outline concerns about the impact of expanding the scheme.\nThe Law Council of Australia’s submission is the most strident, and warns of dire outcomes for the legal profession if it were forced to adopt the changes.\nThe council wrote: “Regulating legal practitioners for AML/CTF would result in erosion of client legal privilege and invalidate confidentiality.\n“Subjecting solicitors and members of the Bar to AML/CTF obligations would hinder the administration of justice and increase costs for the client. In particular barristers because they obtain instructions from solicitors, do not handle trust accounts or keep files are an even lower risk of ML or TF – the manner in which they practice also makes them more susceptible to the costs and burdens of AML regulation.”\nIt goes on to say that “set up and compliance cost will amount to 10% of the entire revenue of the legal profession. This will severely affect the profession’s ability to provide services to clients.”\nA submission from Transparency International Australia supported increased oversight of lawyers, saying: “The new laws will greatly help deter and prevent criminals from hiding behind Australian companies and trusts to move illicit funds and hold tainted assets.”\nTheir submission highlighted risks posed by the legal industry, saying the “current lack of [anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing] due diligence and reporting obligations” for lawyers may “impair intelligence gathering”.\nThe Victorian Legal Services Board and Commissioner supported the extension of anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing obligations, but raised concerns about the potential cost of increased regulation.\nThe Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman submission said that while it “broadly” supported measures for a robust anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing regime, it had concerns about the additional regulatory burden on small businesses.\n“From a small business perspective, the proposed measures will undoubtedly increase the regulatory burden. At this stage it is not clear that the evidence justifies the breadth and potential impact of this imposition.”\nThe Australian Bankers’ Association, which represents all the big banks in the country, supported all the recommendations: “The ABA remains fully supportive of the implementation of all 84 recommendations from the statutory review of the anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing (CTF) regime,” it said.\n“The ABA recommends progressing the Tranche II reforms as a priority. It is vital that Australia closes the current gaps in the Australian money laundering/terrorism financing (ML/TF) regime.”\nThe Australian Automotive Dealers Association said that “motor vehicle dealers should not be subject to the more complex AML/CTF regime”, and outlined that it would be “a disproportionately burdensome response to a modest ML/TF risk”. It instead proposed a restriction on cash transactions for car purchases.\nThe Real Estate Institute of Australia also expressed caution about the level of reporting that could be required as part of the changes: “Almost all real estate agencies are small businesses and as such do not have the structure or the capacity to take on onerous regulatory oversight functions,” its submission said. “The costs associated with replicating the responsibilities and reporting that first tranche companies are undertaking would be prohibitive for the real estate sector and would most likely see the cost imposts leading to closures.”\n• This report was produced with the assistance of a new automated reporting tool (still being tested), which regularly checks government websites for new and modified documents.\n",

        "text": "\nAll four of Australia’s biggest banks have decided to stop charging customers of other banks a $2 fee to withdraw cash from their ATMs.\nThe Commonwealth Bank was the first to announced early on Sunday the abolition of the fee, citing ongoing consumer unhappiness with it.\nNAB, ANZ and Westpac followed suit on Sunday afternoon. But the fee will still apply to customers using overseas bank cards.\n\n\n\n\nCommonwealth Bank faces investigation from banking regulator\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“We think this change will benefit many Australians and hopefully demonstrate our willingness to listen and act on customer feedback,” the Commonwealth Bank’s group executive of retail banking services, Matt Comyn, said.\nNAB’s chief customer officer of consumer banking and wealth, Andrew Hagger, said all Australians, regardless of their bank, could use their ATMs and not be charged a cash withdrawal fee.\nThe ANZ group executive, Fred Ohlsson, said the fee would be dropped on its more than 2,300 machines from early October.\n“While we had been actively working on how we provide fee-free ATMs for our customers, we have decided to remove these fees all together from October,” he said.\nThe Westpac consumer group executive, George Frazis, said the decision would apply to its Westpac, St George, Bank of Melbourne and BankSA customers and particularly benefit rural and regional consumers.\n“We want all Australians, whether they are Westpac Group customers or not, to benefit from one of Australia’s largest ATM networks,” he said. “We understand that the ‘foreign ATM’ fee has been deeply unpopular with consumers.”\nThe move led to a rare moment of praise for the banks from Scott Morrison, who claimed the move came after pressure from the government. The treasurer said that pressure would not abate.\n“It is important that we continue to take action right across the full suite of issues that are needed to ensure that our banking system is stronger, is fairer, is more accountable, and is more competitive,” he said. \n“We are opening our banks up to more competition. We are introducing fairer ways for people to have their claims heard and their issues dealt with by the banks.”\nReserve Bank of Australia data shows Australians made more than 250 million ATM withdrawals from banks other than their own last year, earning the banks millions of dollars.\nComyn said Australians had complained for some time about being charged fees for using another bank’s ATM.\nThe government minister Greg Hunt said getting rid of the $2 fee was good for consumers.\n“I would urge everybody to follow the competitive lead of the Commonwealth Bank,” he told reporters in Melbourne.\nThe Labor leader, Bill Shorten, who was also speaking after the Commonwealth Bank’s announcement but before the ANZ and Westpac’s, said he expected the other big banks to stop rorting their customers but said it was no reason not to hold a royal commission into banking.\n“The Commonwealth Bank has finally realised that the game is up and the rort has got to stop,” he told reporters in Sydney. “Imagine how we could get better banking for all Australians if we had a banking royal commission.”\n\n\n\n\nExecutive pay: top bosses scoop average of $5.7m a year as bonus boom keeps on giving\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bank is facing an Australian Prudential Regulation Authority inquiry over damage to the bank’s reputation and public standing by a range of issues, most recently allegations it breached laws to combat money laundering and terrorism funding.\nSome shareholders are proceeding with a class action over the money-laundering allegations.\nThe no ATM withdrawal fee access applies to the 3,400 CommBank-branded ATMs but excludes Bankwest ATMs and customers using overseas cards.\nThe consumer group Choice has told News Corp the decision will put pressure on other banks to follow suit and drop the unpopular fees.\nWith Australian Associated Press\n",

        "text": "\nRevelations over payments by Azerbaijan to European politicians have seeped into the German election as it emerged that a close ally of Angela Merkel allegedly received money from the authoritarian regime.\nThe revelations are embarrassing for the German chancellor who on Tuesday was due to campaign with Karin Strenz, a Christian Democrat member of parliament, in the Baltic port city of Wismar.\nAccording to the Süddeutsche Zeitung , Strenz was paid between €7,000 and €15,000 (£6,000-£13,000) sent to her via a firm set up by Eduard Lintner, a former German MP and lobbyist for Azerbaijan.\nStrenz has refused to comment and did not respond to emails from the Guardian. \nThe scandal threatens to shake up what has so far been a sleepy election campaign, lacking any of the personal mudslinging or scandal-ridden offensives typical of the US or Britain, with Merkel’s CDU on course to secure victory. Latest polls show it to be on 36% – 14 points ahead of the party’s nearest rival, the Social Democrats. \nLintner was one of several prominent Europeans to have received large sums of money from a scheme nicknamed the Azerbaijani Laundromat, exposed this month by the Guardian and other media partners. Lintner admits the payments but says he did not personally benefit and he was unaware of the original source of the payments.\nAzerbaijan’s ruling elite used the $2.9bn (£2.1bn) fund to silence criticism of the country’s dismal human rights record with a series of under-the-table payments made to leading European politicians.\nLeaked banking data shows that Lintner received more than €800,000 through UK shell companies. Some of this money was paid to other parliamentarians in Germany and Belgium. The payments to Strenz in 2014 and 2015 were sent through Lintner’s company, Line M-Trade, based at the office of his Nuremberg lawyer.\nShe registered the money but the ultimate source of the funding was previously unknown. It is not known whether Strenz was aware of its origin.\nStrenz has visited Azerbaijan on several occasions, including as an election monitor, and is chairwoman of the German-South Caucasian Friendship Group. She has posted a photograph on her website – slogan “Politics can be different” – with Azerbaijan’s authoritarian leader, Ilham Aliyev.\nStrenz, a former teacher, has been a member of parliament since 2009. She is now under pressure to explain whether the payments may have influenced her voting record in Berlin and in the Council of Europe, where she is a member of the parliamentary assembly.\nIn June 2015, Strenz voted against a parliamentary assembly motion calling on Azerbaijan to release its political prisoners, who include several journalists. She was the only German representative who voted no. Strenz has given an approving verdict on Azerbaijan’s elections, in contrast to other observers who have been critical. \n\n\n Quick guide German elections 2017  \n\n\n Show \n\n\n Hide  \n\n\n\n\nWhat's the story?\n\nGermany goes to the polls on 24 September in national elections that will return a new parliament and decide whether Angela Merkel remains chancellor for a fourth consecutive term.\n\n\n\n What are the issues?\n\nImmigration and national security have been prominent, in the wake of Merkel’s decision to open Germany's doors to refugees and migrants in 2015. On the economy, Germans are enjoying near-record low unemployment rates, but there are concerns over the country's ailing infrastructure. \n\n\n\nWhat do the polls say?\n\nMerkel's centre-right Christian Democratic Union is polling at up to 40% with its Bavarian sister the Christian Social Union. The centre-left Social Democratic Party, led by the former European parliament president Martin Schulz, is heading for 23-25%. \nFour smaller parties should get more than 5%: leftists Die Linke; the free-enterprise, pro-business Free Democrats; the Greens; and the Eurosceptic, nationalist Alternative für Deutschland.\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\nWas this helpful?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you for your feedback.\n\n\n\n\nOn Saturday, Alain Destexhe, one of the Belgian delegates caught up in the Laundromat scandal, resigned from the Council of Europe. Destexhe was the author of a parliamentary assembly report on Azerbaijan that failed to mention human rights. A German-Azerbaijan friendship society set up by Lintner funded trips by Destexhe to the capital, Baku. \nIn a separate move, the European parliament last week called for an investigation into the “laundromat” revelations. MEPs have demanded a comprehensive inquiry into “attempts by Azerbaijan and other autocratic regimes … to influence European decision-makers through illicit means”, following a last-minute amendment to a report on corruption.\n",

        "text": "\nThe UK does not have to have identical laws to Brussels in order to align regulations to allow free-flowing trade, one of the cabinet’s leading Brexiters, Chris Grayling, has said, hinting at the path the government may pursue to break the stalemate over the Irish border.\nMichel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, has told member states that the British government has less than 48 hours to agree a text on a potential deal or negotiations will not move on to the second stage.\nDowning Street needs to agree a solution over the Irish-Northern Irish border that will satisfy both the Irish government and Theresa May’s parliamentary allies, the Democratic Unionist party. \nThe negotiations centre on a guarantee of “regulatory alignment” of Northern Ireland with the EU, to allow a free flow of trade and prevent a hard border, which the DUP said was unacceptable if it put Northern Ireland on a different footing to the rest of the UK.\n\n\n Q&A What is regulatory alignment?  \n\n\n Show \n\n\n Hide  \n\n\nInside the EU, both Ireland and Northern Ireland (as part of the UK) are part of the single market and customs union so share the same regulations and standards.\nThe only way to avoid a hardening of the border after Brexit is to ensure regulations and standards on both sides remain more or less the same in areas like food, medicines and so on. \nThis might imply a permanent acceptance of EU rules – something that would be anathema to hardline UK Brexiters and the DUP, who reject anything that would \"decouple\" the North from the UK. \nDavid Davis told parliament that regulatory alignment would not mean adopting exactly the same rules as the EU but \"mutually recognised\" rules and inspections.\nHowever, an official in Brussels countered that regulatory alignment would mean that the UK would have to implement rules from Brussels without having any influence over them.\nWhat is the government’s plan for ‘regulatory alignment’?Davis says the UK could continue to follow some rules of the EU’s single market. This would help avoid a hard border, but would also limit the UK’s ability to diverge from EU regulations.\nWhat does the EU think?Davis thinks the UK and EU can agree to meet the same aims, while achieving them in different ways. The EU believes this could see its standards on workers’ rights and the environment undercut.\nCan it even work?Parliament cannot bind its successors. This principle would mean a deal would never be completely secure for more than five years – putting its feasibility in doubt.\n\n\n\n\n Photograph: PA\n\n\n\n\n\nWas this helpful?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you for your feedback.\n\n\n\n\n Grayling, the transport secretary, said such alignment did not mean the UK had to accept all Brussels regulation. “Plenty of countries have what you call regulatory equivalence where in one country you have anti-money laundering law and you have another in another country,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.\n“They are not the same, they have a similar goal and each recognises the integrity of the other to stamp out money laundering.”\nGrayling said the government would not stitch up a deal where UK laws had to match those of the EU. “We don’t have to have, and we’ve never said we will, and we don’t want to have a situation where in future our laws are identical to the European Union,” he said.\n“There will be areas where we do do things in a similar way. There will be areas where we don’t do things in a similar way. That’s all the prime minister was seeking to achieve to make sure we can ensure trade flows as freely as possible across the borders.”\nOvernight, the Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, struck a similar note, saying that regulatory alignment did not have to apply to everything, merely areas of “north-south” activity.\nHowever, it is understood the DUP believes No 10 is still not offering adequate guarantees that Northern Ireland will be treated in exactly the same way as the rest of the UK after Brexit.\n\n\n Quick guide Why is the Irish border a stumbling block for Brexit?  \n\n\n Show \n\n\n Hide  \n\n\n\n\nCounties and customs\n\nInside the EU, both Ireland and Northern Ireland are part of the single market and customs union so share the same regulations and standards, allowing a soft or invisible border between the two.\nBritain’s exit from the EU – taking Northern Ireland with it – risks a return to a hard or policed border. The only way to avoid this post-Brexit is for regulations on both sides to remain more or less the same in key areas including food, animal welfare, medicines and product safety.\nEarly drafts of the agreement Britain hoped to get signed off on Monday said there would be “no divergence” from EU rules that “support north-south cooperation”, later changed to “continued alignment” in a formulation that appeared to allow for subtle divergences.\nBut it raised new questions about who would oversee it and how disputes might be resolved. It was also clearly still a step too far for the DUP.\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n Photograph: Design Pics Inc/Design Pics RF\n\n\n\n\n\nWas this helpful?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you for your feedback.\n\n\n\n\nGrayling said such disputes were to be expected at tense stages of negotiations. “This is a complex negotiation running up to a deadline next week. It’s not surprising at this stage in the negotiation.”\n\n\n\n\nFor the DUP, the border question is raw identity politics | Graham Gudgin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the Brexit-backing Conservative MP Bernard Jenkin said the UK must not give up its goal of “regulatory autonomy” after Brexit, and accused the European commission of using the Republic of Ireland as a “proxy” to prevent the creation of an open frontier on the EU’s border. \n“I don’t think we should walk away, but I do think we should take a firm line, as the prime minister did earlier this week,” Jenkin told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. \n“We shouldn’t be allowing ourselves to be bullied into promising more and more money, or giving up the goal of regulatory autonomy, or being dragged into a long period of uncertainty without clarity on what we are getting at the end of it.”\n",

The main reason is draconian anti-money laundering rules which oblige banks to police the source of all the funds on their books.\nIt’s unclear why your solicitor fell foul of HSBC.\nWhat is plain is that you have been trapped in the middle of a blame game.\nHSBC, which did not want to comment on the record, kept assuring me that appropriately split cheques had been sent on several occasions, but were returned; your solicitor was equally adamant that only cheques blending all three accounts have been received and duly returned as it would have breached Solicitors Regulation Authority rules to cash them.\nIt took a further seven weeks after I contacted HSBC for the money to reach you, by which time you had lost the property you had been trying to buy and lost the mortgage and legal fees you had already paid.\nPresumably, others also had vital funds stuck in limbo for seven months.\nUnfortunately, as you are not the HSBC customer, your options for compensation are limited, but your solicitor could complain about the handling of her case to the Financial Ombudsman Service.\nIf her complaint is upheld they can require the bank to pay redress.\nIf you need help email Anna Tims at your.problems@observer.co.uk or write to Your Problems, The Observer, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.

        "text": "\nThailand’s highest religious body has begun a process that could defrock a Buddhist abbot wanted for money laundering, escalating a conflict between the military government and a hugely popular temple.\nThe Dhammakaya complex in northern Bangkok has been under siege for nearly three weeks, with more than 4,000 police officers failing to find the sect’s 72-year-old spiritual leader.\nDespite orders to vacate the 1,000-acre complex, monks and volunteers have remained. Three searches by police have found nothing.\nPhra Dhammachayo is accused of colluding in a £28m money laundering scheme but has eluded arrest, infuriating the junta, which took power in a 2014 coup. To find him, the government has invoked special constitutional powers normally intended for national security threats, in what has become a high-stakes, face-saving standoff and a national obsession.\nIn the latest victory for the ruling generals, the governing body of the Buddhist order in Thailand, the Sangha council, became involved in the case. “This is the first step, and the last will be the disrobing of Phra Dhammachayo,” Pongporn Pramsaneh, head of the National Office of Buddhism, told reporters on Friday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  A monk stands inside the temple north of Bangkok. Photograph: Oliver Holmes for the Guardian\n\n\nFounded in 1970 as a meditation-focused forest retreat on the outskirts of the capital, the temple has grown an extremely dedicated following through savvy marketing, including televised sermons and gatherings of hundreds of thousands of devotees.\nA follower sneaked the Guardian past police lines last week into the temple grounds. Inside, hundreds of people sat on plastic chairs blocking the main route, most with their eyes closed and deep in meditation. Others rested in tents.\nPhra Pasura Dantamano, an English-speaking monk who has been at the temple for 11 years, said followers were suspicious of the government and felt a sense of ownership over the temple.\n\n\n\n\nThe Makha Bucha Day ceremony for Buddhist monks – in pictures\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“They are here to protect their own home. This is not like a political demonstration. They are not going to fight because these people do not know how to fight. They will just stay here – meditating and chanting.”\nThe government has taken what many see as drastic measures to enforce a blockade. It ordered telecoms companies to cut mobile phone reception at the temple, and certain food and medical items have been prevented from entering, a move templegoers say is a breach of their human rights.\nFor years, the sect has been the subject of fascination, mostly due to its unique structures, including a UFO-shaped pagoda made with a million golden Buddha statues. The temple grounds cover an area bigger than Monaco.\nAnother construction, the newly built headquarters, is multistoreyed and circular with a giant peacock stamped on the front. It symbolises the world, monks say, and the peacock is a nod to the abbot’s former mentor, a Buddhist nun whose name means peacock. Many of the birds can be found wandering the grounds.\nThe temple declares it is apolitical, but its millions-strong following in Thailand is viewed by the generals who run the country as a threat. The temple has also denied alleged associations with the junta’s main political foe, former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra.\n“In Thailand, there has not been a temple of this size with this amount of followers in history,” said Phra Pasura Dantamano.\n\n\n\n\nTop Thai Buddhist monk investigated over vintage Mercedes-Benz\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“When a certain group of people in power, especially when they attained power that way, I can understand their fear,” he said, alluding to the 2014 coup. “They might be afraid that if we try to mobilise these followers against them, it could be a threat. But I will say that they are too panicked about that.”\nThe temple contends that any money laundering charges were settled years ago when the money, which it says was believed to be a legitimate donation, was repaid. But when the case was reopened, the abbot requested police visit him for questioning inside the temple due to his ill health, angering authorities.\n After three summons for questioning, the police issued an arrest warrant, but the abbot did not show. \nWith more than 90 branches in 35 countries and a canny social media presence, the temple has become extremely rich. Traditionalists have lamented its focus on monetary donations and sermons that give blessing for wealth.\nBut the temple says its assets are spent on society, launching projects to combat teen pregnancy and opening meditation centres.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  A Thai soldier takes a photograph during the search of the Dhammakaya complex. Photograph: Narong Sangnak/EPA\n\n\nFollowers are eager to point out that the temple’s apparently ostentatious shrines, including one in the shape of a golden pyramid, are largely functional and simple compared with the intricate, golden filigree found at other Buddhist sites. \nAnd the high-rise condominiums on the grounds may look flashy, one devotee said, but they house eight monks in each room, none with air conditioning.\nThere have been a few scuffles between police and monks outside the complex but, for the most part, the government has been eager to avoid images of men in uniform using force against saffron-clad monks.\nYet the junta is working other levers of power – the abbot was recently stripped of his monastic rank by the country’s new monarch, King Maha Vajiralongkorn. Now the case has gone to the Sangha council, he could be defrocked, ejecting him from the monkshood.\n“Whenever Thailand is in an unstable situation, especially politically, Wat Phra Dhammakaya has always been a target,” said Phra Pasura Dantamano, who had to cut his interview short as he was summoned for questioning. \n“We have nowhere else to go.

        "text": "\nUK banks have been told by the City regulator they should not use anti-money laundering rules as an excuse to close accounts for charities, politicians and other clients just because they perceive them as risky.\nPublishing an assessment of how banks have responded to rules intended to hold them accountable for money laundering offences, the Financial Conduct Authority said: “It is important that banks retain flexibility in setting up appropriate systems and controls to ensure they comply with legislation as well as in making commercial decisions on whether to provide banking facilities that are consistent with their tolerance of risk. \n“However, banks should not use AML [anti-money laundering] as an excuse for closing accounts when they are closing them for other reasons.”\nThe FCA published a report which attempted to assess how banks had responded to the crackdown on money laundering, particularly after the penalties imposed on banks such as HSBC, which was fined £1.2bn by US regulators in 2012 for offences related to its Mexican operations. \nThe report said two large UK banks closed about 1,000 personal accounts and 600 business or corporate accounts “for being, essentially, outside risk appetite”. \nIt also highlighted how one bank had tripled the number of staff working on compliance while at the same time cutting accounts, having the effect of increasing the annual cost of compliance from £60-£70 a customer to more than £300 in less than two years.\nThe situation has been highlighted on a number of occasions in recent years, notably with Barclays in 2013 when Olympian Mo Farah urged the bank not to end a relationship with the Dahabshiil money transfer business. \nThe FCA reminded banks that they were also subject to competition law which could be relevant when ending relationships. “We note that banks, like all firms, are subject to competition law, in particular the prohibitions on anticompetitive agreements and abuse of market power contained in the UK Competition Act 1998, and in the treaty on the functioning of the European Union. They should be mindful of these obligations when deciding to terminate existing relationships or decline new relationships,.”\nIt added: “We would emphasise that many of the client exits alluded to above result from a ‘perfect storm’ of multiple impacts, including higher capital requirements, higher costs for compliance resource, higher levels of sanctions, a perception of higher risk of sanctions, and specific US private legal cases, inter alia [among other things], which in many banks provided a suitable context for a strategic review.” \n",

        "text": "\nThe British government has been accused of being weak on tax avoidance after failing to block the EU from taking the first step in naming and shaming its overseas territories in a tax haven blacklist.\nMinisters in recent weeks fought to prevent Brussels from sending of letters informing 12 countries that they would be listed unless they promised to change their tax rules. The final EU blacklist is due to be published on 5 December.\nThe correspondence was eventually sent to the British overseas territories, but only following a ruling by members states’ experts sitting on a European council code of conduct group, which trumped the initial British protests.\nIn response to the development, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, Vince Cable, accused Downing Street of impoverishing the Treasury to protect tax havens used by the super-rich to hide their cash.\nCable said Theresa May and David Cameron, under whom he served as business secretary, had been consistently weak in clamping down on the overseas territories.\nHe said: “There is little doubt that systematic tax avoidance is causing significant damage to the British revenue position in the budget. Why on earth is the British government blocking sensible, practical attempts by the European Union to stop predatory behaviour by some of its member states?”\nThe former cabinet minister argued there was a long history of the British government “dragging its heels” when it came to the tax practices of its own overseas territories – claiming he witnessed the lack of action when he was in the coalition government.\n“Some Caribbean islands in particular were operating to very poor standards, sometimes to the cost of British government,” the former business secretary said. Cable added that the government had a range of sanctions from barring companies registered in tax havens from public service contracts all the way up to direct rule. \n“When we brought in the register, David Cameron himself got the overseas territories to come to the UK to try to persuade them to follow the British model, but they didn’t and nothing was done to enforce it,” Cable said.\nA British government spokesman said: “The UK is at the forefront of tackling avoidance and ensuring tax transparency. We support the development of a blacklist and are working with our European partners. Our goal is to finalise a common EU blacklist by the end of 2017.”\nBrussels wrote to 41 countries at the end of October informing them that they would be blacklisted unless they promised to change their tax rules. Further letters were sent once the British “blockage”, as it was described by one diplomat, was removed.\nThe UK has consistently argued that the overseas territories such as Bermuda, the Isle of Man and the Cayman Islands should not be named and shamed for having a 0% corporate tax rate, despite the recent outcry over tax avoidance and evasion by the super rich.\nLast year, the Observer revealed that the Treasury had argued that inclusion of British overseas territories, including the territory through which Google funnelled its billions of profits, on the blacklist would be “misleading and deeply unhelpful”.\nA commission official declined to comment on the British position. “The list should be finalised next month,” the official said. “Member states are working to deliver the first EU blacklist in December, as planned based on the process launched by the commission in January 2016.\n“The vast majority of non-EU jurisdictions that have been contacted by the EU during the screening process have engaged in dialogue with us on the possible issues identified. This is encouraging.\n“However, we can confirm that member states in the code of conduct group have written to a number of jurisdictions regarding deficiencies that were identified during the screening phase.\n“We said that the EU would proactively engage with the relevant jurisdictions throughout the listing process, and that is what member states are doing.” \nThe UK is also one of a few member states resisting improvements to the anti-money laundering rules to reveal the real “beneficial” owners behind companies and trusts in the EU. \nThe changes would oblige EU member states to operate fully public registers disclosing the “beneficial ownership” of trusts. The UK claims it would be an infringement of privacy to reveal the beneficiaries of trusts.\nLaure Brillaud, from Transparency International, said: “The Paradise Papers have shown that trusts are an essential piece of the offshore puzzle. A new legislation that would not fully cover and increase transparency on trusts doing business in the EU would miss the whole point.\n“Member states, including those on their way out, must take the opportunity of the new EU anti-money laundering directive to change the rules of the game.\n“Any countries which attempt to block progress on this will only be proving that they are in favour of the status quo of secrecy which allows wealth to be hidden offshore.”\n",

        "title": "Operation Car Wash: The biggest corruption scandal ever?",

        "text": "\nOn 14 January 2015, police agent Newton Ishii was waiting in Rio de Janeiro’s Galeão airport to meet the midnight flight from London. His mission was simple. A former executive of Brazil’s national oil company, Petrobras, was on the plane. Ishii was to arrest him as soon as he set foot in Brazil and take him for questioning by detectives.\nNo big deal, the veteran cop thought as he ticked off the hours in the shabby Terminal One lounge. This was just one of many anti-bribery operations he had worked on. Usually they made a few headlines, then faded away, leaving the perpetrators to carry on as if nothing had happened. There was a popular expression for this: acabou em pizza (to end up with pizza), which suggested that there was no political row that could not be settled over a meal and a few beers.\n\n\n\n\nOperation Car Wash: Is this the biggest corruption scandal in history? – podcast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the plane finally landed, Ishii’s target was easy to identify among the passengers in the arrivals hall. Nestor Cerveró has a strikingly asymmetrical face, with his left eye set lower than the right. “He couldn’t believe it. He said I had made a mistake,” Ishii recalled later. “I told him I was just doing my job and that he could take up his complaints with the judge.”\nCerveró called his brother and a lawyer. He expected to be free before morning. Ishii, too, had few illusions that his suspect would be locked up for long. Decades on the force had taught him how quickly the rich and powerful could wriggle off the hook. There was little reason to think this case would be any different.\nAs it turned out, both men were wrong.\nThe investigation that led to Cerveró’s arrest – codenamed Lava Jato (Car Wash) – was about to uncover an unprecedented web of corruption. At first, the press described it as the biggest corruption scandal in the history of Brazil; then, as other countries and foreign firms were dragged in, the world. The case would go on to discover illegal payments of more than $5bn to company executives and political parties, put billionaires in jail, drag a president into court and cause irreparable damage to the finances and reputations of some of the world’s biggest companies. It would also expose a culture of systemic graft in Brazilian politics, and provoke a backlash from the establishment fierce enough to bring down one government and leave another on the brink of collapse.\nLaunched in March 2014, the operation had initially focused on agents known as doleiros (black market money dealers), who used small businesses, such as petrol stations and car washes, to launder the profits of crime. But police soon realised they were on to something bigger when they discovered that the doleiros were working on behalf of an executive at Petrobras, Paulo Roberto Costa, the director of refining and supply. This link led prosecutors to uncover a vast and extraordinarily intricate web of corruption. Under questioning, Costa described how he, Cerveró and other Petrobras directors had been deliberately overpaying on contracts with various companies for office construction, drilling rigs, refineries and exploration vessels. The contractors they were paying had formed an agreement to ensure they were guaranteed business on excessively lucrative terms if they agreed to channel a share of between 1% and 5% of every deal into secret slush funds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Oil executive Nestor Cerveró, whose arrest marked a turning point in the Car Wash corruption investigation. Photograph: Evaristo Sa/AFP/Getty\n\n\nAfter diverting millions of dollars into those funds, Petrobras directors then used them to funnel money to the politicians who had appointed them in the first place, and to the political parties they represented. The main objective of the racket – which fleeced taxpayers and shareholders out of billions of dollars – was to fund election campaigns to keep the governing coalition in power. But it wasn’t just politicians who benefited. Everyone connected to the deals received a bribe, in cash, or sometimes in the form of luxury cars, expensive art works, Rolex watches, $3,000 bottles of wine, yachts and helicopters. Huge sums were deposited in Swiss bank accounts, or laundered via overseas property deals or smaller companies. The means of transfer were deliberately complicated, in order to hide the money’s origins, or low-tech, to keep it off the books. Prosecutors discovered that elderly mules were flying from city to city with shrink-wrapped bricks of cash strapped to their bodies.\nPetrobras was no ordinary company. As well as having the highest market valuation (and the largest debts) of any corporation in Latin America, it was a flagship for an emerging economy that was trying to tap the biggest oil discovery of the 21st century – huge new oil fields in deep waters off the coast of Rio de Janeiro. Petrobras accounted for more than an eighth of all investments in Brazil, providing hundreds of thousands of jobs in construction firms, shipyards and refineries, and forming business ties with international suppliers including Rolls-Royce and Samsung Heavy Industries.\nPetrobras was also at the centre of Brazil’s politics. During the 2003-2010 presidency of the Workers’ Party leader Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (known as Lula), executive posts in Petrobras were offered to Lula’s political allies, to help build support in Congress. Petrobras’s commercial and strategic importance was such that the US National Security Agency made it a target for surveillance. As the Car Wash investigation was to prove, if you could unravel the secrets of this company, you would unravel the secrets of the state.\nFirst, though, investigators had to get executives to talk. Until very recently, that would have been unthinkable. A culture of impunity had long reigned in Brazil. But times were changing, as Petrobras executive Nestor Cerverò was about to find out. When he saw the state of the mattress in the airport detention centre, he threw a tantrum. “How am I going to lie on this?” he said.\n“It’s either that or sleep standing up,” Ishii replied. Within an hour, Cerverò had dozed off, only to be shaken out of his slumber at 6am.\n“Where’s my breakfast?” he demanded.\n“You’re not getting one,” Ishii answered. “I’m taking you to Curitiba.”\n\nCuritiba, the heart of the Car Wash investigation, is the capital of the southern state of Paraná. By Brazilian standards, at 845km it is not far from Rio, but culturally, they are worlds apart. Curitiba is known as the “London of Brazil” because its people are considered more inclined to be sticklers for the rules than residents of the bigger cities in the north. In recent years, it has won international praise for its pioneering public transport system, environmental policies and hipster scene. Thanks to Operation Car Wash, however, it is now best known for its judges, prosecutors and police.\nWithout one simple reform, however, the investigation might never have taken off. Dilma Rousseff took over from Lula as leader of the Workers’ Party and became president of a coalition government after the 2010 election. In the wake of nationwide anti-corruption demonstrations in 2013, Rousseff had tried to placate an angry public by fast-tracking laws aimed at rooting out systemic fraud. New measures included, for the first time in Brazil, plea bargaining: prosecutors could now make deals with suspects, reducing their sentences in return for information that could lead to the arrest of more important figures.\nOverseeing the case in Curitiba was Sérgio Moro, an ambitious young judge who helped prosecutors put pressure on suspects by approving lengthy “preventive detentions”. In the overwhelming majority of cases, Brazilian prisoners remanded in custody before trial are poor. Moro took the unusual step of also denying bail to the rich. Ostensibly, he did so to stop them using economic or political influence to escape any charges against them. However, the pressure was on them: make a deal or stay in jail.\nCerveró was not the first to face this choice. He joined a parade of VIP Car Wash suspects – corporate executives, wealthy entrepreneurs and, later, even one or two powerful politicians – who spent months inside the Curitiba detention centre. They had to be kept separate from other inmates for their own safety, which meant their side of the jail quickly became overcrowded. Having lived in luxury, these super-rich prisoners were squeezed three to a one-man cell. Their new circumstances came as a shock. “One guy did not know how to shave because he had always had it done for him,” said a guard, who asked to remain anonymous. Cerveró apparently had serious problems adapting. His cellmates complained that he urinated on them in the night and washed his backside in the sink.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Brazilian police officer Newton Ishii, who became a hero to many for his role in the Car Wash investigation. Photograph: Hedeson Alves/EPA\n\n\nIf inmates refused to cooperate with the prosecution, privileges such as TV and exercise were withdrawn. “Many suspects made deals after a visit from their loved ones,” said the guard. “I think it was because they smelled the perfume and soap of the lives they had left behind.” Some resisted for months, others just days. But almost all of them broke in the end.\nDefence lawyers complained, with some justification, that these tactics were legally dubious and unethical, because defendants would say or do anything to get out of jail. But polls indicated the public was delighted that the age-old problem of corruption was finally being exposed in a major nationwide operation. Almost every day, details of a dawn raid by police or another shocking allegation were splashed across the front pages: more than $2bn siphoned off Petrobras in bribes and secret payments for contract work, $3.3bn paid in bribes by the construction firm Odebrecht, more than 1,000 politicians on the take from the meat-packing firm JBS, 16 companies implicated, at least 50 congressmen accused, four former presidents under investigation.\nAs the staggering scale of the skulduggery emerged, many Brazilians focused their fury on politicians – initially Lula, Rousseff and others in the Workers’ Party. The newspapers trumpeted the message that the dirty socialists in Brasilia were wholly responsible for the problem. The reality was considerably less clear-cut. Just about every major party was involved in multiple, interconnected trails of corruption going back to earlier governments. And it was the Workers’ Party that had put in place the judicial reforms that allowed the investigation to go ahead. There would have been no Car Wash if the government had not appointed, in September 2013, an independent attorney general.\nNewspaper columnists contrasted the dirty world of politics with the high-minded work of the judiciary in the “Republic of Curitiba”. When Judge Moro walked into a restaurant, people would stand up and applaud. Graffiti on walls and banners draped from apartment balconies declared “God save Moro”. Protesters in the streets held up placards declaring “Moro for president”. The federal police also won praise. Ishii became the public face of the investigation: as the officer charged with taking suspects from the airport to the detention centre and the courthouse, he was in almost every picture and video related to the case. On social networks and in headlines, he was nicknamed Japones Bonzinho (the Good Japanese). At carnival, he was honoured with a six-metre-high doll and a samba tribute song, with lyrics imagining a suspect who wakes to find he is the latest target of Operation Car Wash: “Oh my God, I am politically dead! Knocking at my door is the Japanese fed.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Carnival masks made in the likeness of Newton Ishii. Photograph: Felipe Dana/AP\n\n\nIn person, Ishii is circumspect and austere. When I visited him at his modest apartment in Curitiba, he was careful to downplay his role. He explained that his celebrity had reached the point where he felt trapped. At one public event, he was mobbed by adoring members of the public and had to be escorted out by security guards. A traffic cop pulled him over to ask for his autograph. Bizarrely, even the relatives of the Car Wash prisoners would ask him to share selfies and say how much they admired his work.\nIshii said he realised Car Wash was something special when he saw wealthy businessmen not just go to jail, but stay there. “That’s when the penny dropped. I began to think, hey, I’m in a country where there is an expression, ‘Only the poor get arrested’ – but here are these millionaires getting thrown in prison.”\nMore was to come. From corporate executives, Car Wash investigators turned their attention to politicians. Dishonest and venal senators and congressmen had long been protected by the immunity of office. But a window for prosecution was opening. The judiciary was in the ascendant, the electorate was mad as hell, and old loyalties were starting to crack. All the prosecutors needed was a little leverage.\n\nTo lure one of Brazil’s most powerful politicians out into the open, prosecutors planned a sting operation, using Petrobras’s Nestor Cerveró as bait. Senator Delcídio do Amaral, the Workers’ Party leader in the upper house, was an old associate of Cerveró. They had worked together at Petrobras between 2000 and 2001. After that, Cerveró had become Amaral’s faithful servant, raising illegal contributions for whichever party the fickle senator was aligned with. After Cerveró’s arrest, Amaral knew he was at risk of exposure. Desperate to find a way to discourage him from talking, Amaral arranged to meet Cerveró’s son, Bernardo, in Brasilia.\nOn 4 November 2015, Amaral met with Bernardo Cerveró at the Royal Tulip Hotel. Unaware that Bernardo was secretly recording the conversation, the senator made a number of incriminating statements, which were later leaked to the press. Amaral offered to pay $1m upfront, plus a further $13,000 a month, in exchange for Nestor Cerveró’s silence. When this was rebuffed, he said he could arrange Bernardo’s father’s escape from prison.\n“How?” Bernardo asked.\nFirst, Amaral explained, he would use his influence on a particular judge to arrange for Cerveró to be moved from his prison cell and placed under house arrest. Then, he described in detail how the prisoner’s electronic tag could be deactivated, so he could flee undetected. Cerveró could then charter a private plane to neighbouring Paraguay. Amaral would arrange the whole thing.\nAs soon as the judges heard the recording, they ordered the senator to be detained on charges of conspiracy to obstruct justice. It was a momentous decision. No sitting senator had been arrested in 30 years.\nAmaral was taken into custody on the morning of 26 November 2015. He immediately agreed to co-operate with investigators and tell them everything he knew about the illegal activities of his fellow politicians, including the then president Rousseff, who he accused of conspiring to obstruct justice. He singled out former president Lula as the mastermind of the Petrobras corruption scheme.\nThe senator claimed it was Lula who had organised the payoffs and urged him to get Cerveró out of the country, because he wanted to protect a close friend who had been involved in negotiations between politicians and oil company officials. Lula and Rousseff denied the allegations and accused Amaral of lying to save himself. “I never imagined he was such a scrotum,” Jaques Wagner, Rousseff’s former chief of staff, told Lula in a phone call recorded by police. But while his critics accused him of spectacular betrayal, Amaral painted his testimony in a heroic light, saying he was doing the nation a favour by exposing the powerful to justice.\n“Because I was someone who was talking to the government, talking to parliament, talking with leading Brazilian businessmen, talking to Petrobras, with Eletrobras, with all the state, I had no doubt that my collaboration would be a watershed in the investigation,” Amaral told me in an interview last summer.\nThanks to his cooperation, Amaral was living under house arrest in his brother’s luxurious mansion in one of São Paulo’s swankiest neighbourhoods. When I arrived to meet him, a maid answered the door and led me past a pool and an outdoor jacuzzi to a private bar decorated with neon signs for Coors and Miller beer, a Wurlitzer jukebox and celebrity memorabilia: Ayrton Senna’s F1 racing helmet, Mike Tyson’s boxing glove, Buzz Aldrin’s framed autograph and Eric Clapton’s guitar.\nAmaral left open the possibility that he would make a return to politics. The system needed to change, he argued, because corruption had become ingrained from long before the Workers’ Party took power.\nBrazil’s political scene is highly vulnerable to corruption. With dozens of parties and elections at three levels (federal, state and city) across one of the world’s largest countries, campaigns are extremely expensive and it is almost impossible for any single political group to secure a majority. Gaining power involves winning elections and paying other parties to form coalitions, both of which require huge sums of money. As a result, one of the greatest prizes in Brazilian politics has long been the power to appoint senior executives at state-run companies, because each executive could expect to receive millions in kickbacks from contractors, much of which could be siphoned off into campaign coffers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Former Brazilian presidents Dilma Rousseff and Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.

After winning the presidency on his fourth attempt, in 2002, Lula had been stuck with a minority in Congress. His chief of staff bought the support of minor parties by arranging monthly payments, known as mensalão, mostly paid by construction firms in exchange for building contracts. Although illegal, this allowed the Workers’ Party to get things done. Lula’s first term delivered impressive progress on alleviating poverty, social spending and environmental controls. None of the subsequent three Workers’ Party administrations came close to achieving as much. Unfortunately, because Lula’s reforms had only got through parliament with the aid of bribery, those achievements were built on ethical quicksand.\nWhen the mensalão scandal was revealed in 2004, the Workers’ Party had no choice but to stop paying its coalition partners, and Lula was again stuck with a minority in Congress. Worse, he now faced the danger of being impeached. To prevent this, he reached out to one of his party’s biggest rivals: the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB), led by Michel Temer. This marriage of convenience was doomed from the start.\nThe PMDB is Brazil’s biggest political party, but has never taken an ideological stance or a leadership role, preferring to do deals to shore up governments. It is a mishmash of factions, ranging from conservative rural landowners and urban social democrats to evangelical nationalists and former guerrillas, whose only common ground is a desire to secure the patronage, prestige and bribes that come with government posts. The party has been involved in every corruption scandal in modern Brazilian history. But Lula was desperate, so he struck a deal. In return for support in Congress, the Workers’ Party gave Temer’s PMDB control of the international division of Petrobras and the funds that flowed from it. Cerveró, then the director of that division, was required to deliver payoffs to different masters. It was a gruelling task. In 2008, Cerveró failed to deliver sufficient funds and he was forced to stand down.\nTemer has been named countless times in Car Wash testimonies. Julio Camargo, a consultant for the Toyo Setal construction and engineering company, said money was channelled from Petrobras to a lobbyist representing senior PMDB figures, including Temer. One industrialist testified that Temer had arranged illicit payments into the party’s campaign coffers, and had taken leadership of the PMDB in order to control who got the millions of dollars that were being siphoned off from Petrobras, Odebrecht and their suppliers. A former Odebrecht vice president, Cláudio Melo Filho, testified that in 2014, he secretly donated 10m reais (£2.3m) to Temer’s political campaign.\n“This bomb could end in his lap in a more serious way than for Rousseff. He’s more involved than her,” a source said.\nTemer – a constitutional lawyer – publicly denied the allegations, saying suggestions of illegality were “frivolous” and “untruthful”. Despite the long list of accusations, almost none stuck. Other testimonies against him were withdrawn. No charges were filed. Prosecutors said there was not enough evidence. Temer seemed untouchable.\n\nBy the start of 2016, the economy had plunged into recession. The main cause was a collapse in global commodity prices, but the Car Wash investigation made a bad problem worse. Prosecutors had ordered Petrobras to suspend business with many of its contractors, including Odebrecht, the biggest building firm in Latin America. Projects were paralysed, workers were laid off and the unemployment rate almost doubled in the space of two years. Political activity was also paralysed. The arrest of Amaral had shaken congressmen out of the assumption that they could rely on their positions to avoid prosecution, and relations between parties became more hostile.\nSenator Amaral told me he had warned President Rousseff repeatedly of the dangers of pushing too far with the Car Wash investigation, but she would not listen. “She always underestimated Car Wash, because she thought it would reach everyone but her,” he recalled. “She thought it would make her stronger.”\nA majority of the public blamed the economic misery and political gridlock on the Workers’ Party, which had been in power for 13 years. Rousseff’s approval ratings slipped into single digits. She was even more unpopular in Congress, owing to her woeful communication skills, secretiveness and stubbornness. Several powerful senators and deputies – the Brazilian Congress has two houses, the upper Federal Senate and the lower Chamber of Deputies – were also furious that the president refused to halt the corruption investigation, or to protect senior members of her ruling coalition.\nThe bid to oust Rousseff as head of state was initiated in November 2015 by one of the most corrupt politicians in the country, Eduardo Cunha, in an attempt to stop or divert Car Wash. Cunha, the speaker of Brazil’s lower house, was an ally of Temer in the PMDB, with a reputation for scheming and underhand tactics. He was also a chief target of the Car Wash prosecutors. As evidence piled up through 2015, they accused him of corruption and perjury after uncovering his secret Swiss bank accounts, which contained more than $5m dollars and credit card bills bearing witness to a lavish lifestyle far beyond his declared income of $120,000. The Workers’ Party refused to protect Cunha against charges brought by the lower house ethics committee. Cunha hit back by granting one of the many impeachment requests against Rousseff. It accused Rousseff of false accounting – shifting significant funds between accounts to make government finances look better than they were. Many previous administrations had done the same thing with impunity, albeit not on such a great scale. But that was not the point. The targets of Car Wash needed a pretext on which to strike back.\nOn 4 March 2016, prosecutors briefly detained Lula for questioning about the Petrobras kickback scheme. There were additional allegations of influence peddling, including deals secured for Odebrecht in return for generous payments to companies owned by Lula’s relatives. Millions of anti-government protesters took to the streets a week later, on 13 March, bearing inflatable dolls of Lula in prison clothing, chanting “Fora Dilma” (Rousseff Out!), carrying banners and shaking brooms to symbolise the need for a clean sweep.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Inflatable effigies of Dilma Rousseff and Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva at a protest in São Paulo in April 2016. Photograph: Cris Faga/CON/Latin Content/Getty\n\n\nLula and Rousseff had undoubtedly benefited from the corruption politically, but it is less clear – particularly in Rousseff’s case – that they had gained personally. By contrast, the hypocrisy of many of their accusers was staggering. At a parliamentary impeachment session in April, many of those who voted to eject Rousseff from office had themselves either been charged or were under investigation for far more serious crimes.\nIn May, as impeachment proceedings against Rousseff continued, Michel Temer became interim president, even though he was mentioned multiple times in the Car Wash investigation, along with seven members of his cabinet. Critics speculated that Temer was being protected to ensure a degree of stability during a period of turbulence. Even when Temer was found guilty in June 2016 of election violations and disqualified from running for office for eight years by a lower court judge in São Paulo, it made no difference. As interim president, he was shielded by the immunity of office. Car Wash, which had been launched to clean up corruption in the system, had ended up helping the leader of Brazil’s most notoriously self-serving party to reach the pinnacle of power.\nRousseff’s supporters called it a coup, though the impeachment had been approved by the largely Workers’ Party-appointed supreme court, as well as large majorities in both houses. Temer insisted the letter of the law had been followed. “Brazil has gone through a difficult period of political disputes, but the Constitution has been honoured,” the new president insisted. Soon after, however, it became clear that many of his supporters had been motivated by self-preservation rather than national salvation.\n\n\n\n\nBrazil president formally accused of conspiracy against corruption inquiry\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Temer’s first month as president, three more of his ministers were forced to resign as a result of secretly recorded phone conversations, which confirmed Rousseff had been ousted because she would not call off the Car Wash investigation.\n“We have to stop this shit … We have to change the government to be able to stop this bleeding,” one of the chief plotters, Romero Jucá – the PMDB leader in the upper house – told Sérgio Machado, the former president of Transpetro, Brazil’s largest oil and gas transportation company. Unknown to Jucá, the conversation was being recorded. In that call, in March 2016, Jucá revealed that he had discussed the plan with supreme court justices and military commanders: the aim was to usurp Rousseff and replace her with Temer. Jucá maintains that his words were taken out of context.\nBut getting the Workers’ Party out of government was only the first step in stopping Car Wash. The conspirators had another problem: Teori Zavascki, the supreme court justice overseeing the investigation, who had proved to be incorruptible.\n“One way (to halt the operation) is to find someone who has access to Teori, but it seems there is no one,” says Machado in the recording.\n“He’s closed off,” Jucá agrees.\nThis obstacle did not stay in place for long.\n\nDuring a thunderstorm on 19 January 2017, a Hawker Beechcraft twin-prop aircraft crashed into the ocean near Paraty, 150 miles west of Rio de Janeiro, killing all four people on board. The plane was on its way from São Paulo to Rio. It might have been seen as just another aviation accident, were it not for the fact that one of the victims was judge Teori Zavascki.\nThe timing and nature of the crash inevitably raised suspicions. Zavascki was in the process of reviewing numerous Car Wash testimonies that were expected to further implicate politicians in Brazil and other countries in Latin America. His family said he had received threats the previous year. \nInitial findings from the plane’s wreckage and the cockpit voice recorder suggested there was no mechanical failure. The pilot was experienced and had given lessons to other aircrews on how to land on the small airstrip at Paraty. But small planes have a terrible safety record in Brazil. Speculation in the media suggested that either the pilot had made a fatal misjudgment of altitude or the plane and its passengers were victims of foul play.\nWhatever its causes, the consequences of the crash were far-reaching. Zavascki had maintained the investigation’s credibility in the face of fierce political opposition, and he had ruled on some of its most contentious cases. On hearing news of the judge’s death, Moro said: “Without him, there would be no Operation Car Wash.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Judge Sérgio Moro, who relentlessly pursued prosecutions in the Car Wash case. Photograph: Brazil Photo Press/CON/LatinContent/Getty Images\n\n\nZavascki exemplified the idealistic and ultimately self-sabotaging stance of the Workers’ Party in its relationship to the justice system. After the party took power, judges, prosecutors and police were given far more scope to act. Under the previous conservative administration, the attorney general had filed away so many incomplete investigations that he was nicknamed the engavetador general (shelver-in-chief). Lula, by contrast, let prosecutors elect a new attorney general – Rodrigo Janot – who was so independent that he approved the charges against Lula, the Workers’ Party founder.\n“Before Lula took power, we were toothless,” said Luis Humberto, of the Federal Police union. “The Workers’ Party increased our budget, upgraded our equipment and gave us more authority. It is ironic. They lost power because they did the right thing.”\nTemer chose one of his close allies to replace Zavascki. Alexandre de Moraes, who was justice minister, went straight from the cabinet to the highest court. It was a clear violation of the constitutional principle of a separation of powers. Several of the senators who confirmed his appointment were ministerial colleagues – including Jucá, and the head of the upper house, Renan Calheiros – who have been charged in the Car Wash case. When a supreme court judge ordered Calheiros to step down while he was awaiting trial, Calheiros simply ignored him. Moraes, who lacked any experience as a judge, is now one of 11 supreme court justices who will hear his case.\nIn Congress, meanwhile, the PMDB-led ruling bloc have repeatedly attempted – so far unsuccessfully – to change the law so that testimonies resulting from plea bargains are no longer admissible in court. This would enable dozens of politicians to escape possible conviction.\n\nSo far, Car Wash investigators have resisted political pressure and expanded their list of targets. After shifting focus from Petrobras to Odebrecht, in April 2017 prosecutors opened new probes into dozens more politicians from all sides of the political spectrum, including eight members of Temer’s cabinet. They then widened their net to include JBS, one of the world’s biggest meat-packing firms. A plea bargain made on 18 May by the two brothers who own the company – Joesley and Wesley Batista – includes secret recordings allegedly made in March, in which Temer allegedly discusses hush-money payments to Cunha, and details of bribery by one of the president’s aides. The attorney general has now formally accused Temer of conspiring to obstruct Car Wash, setting the stage for a constitutional battle between the judiciary and the government and prompting calls in Congress for the impeachment of a second president in a year. Temer denies the charges.\nThe web of corruption has been traced far beyond Brazil’s borders. Odebrecht had a department dedicated to bribes, known as the Division of Structured Operations, which laid out close to $800m in illicit pay-offs for more than 100 contracts in a dozen countries over 15 years. Dozens of foreign corporate suppliers (of engineering equipment, power lines, drilling rigs and so forth) also face regulatory and shareholder inquiries about the bribes they paid to secure contracts with Petrobras. Among them was Rolls-Royce, which posted hefty losses as a result of penalties imposed in January this year by Brazilian, UK and US authorities. The World Cup and Olympics have also been sucked into the mire with fraud investigations now focused on six out of the 12 stadiums used in 2014 and 2016.\nThe investigation has shaken political and economic life and raised hopes that, for once, justice will be applied to the rich and powerful. There was a genius in the way Ishii’s arrest of Cerveró paved the way for trials of politicians. Several previously untouchable senators, congressmen and governors are now in jail, including Cunha. Powerful businessmen have also been put behind bars, including Marcelo Odebrecht, the head of the vast construction firm. Even the celebrity cop Ishii was suspended from the Car Wash investigation after he lost an appeal against an old bribery charge. More than at any time in Brazil’s recent history, there is a genuine sense that nobody is above the law, that scandals do not always have to “end in pizza”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  A photograph of Michel Temer, president of Brazil, on a mock coffin during a protest in Rio de Janeiro last month. Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty\n\n\nThe story is by no means over. Attorney general Rodrigo Janot, who is due to leave office in September, is under pressure. Mainstream parties from the left and right are lined up against the investigation. The government is trying to hamper Operation Car Wash by slashing the federal police budget by 44% and reducing the number of agents working on it. Moro must keep the public on his side as he begins a series of trials of Lula, who plans to run for president again in 2018 if he is not jailed.\nBrazil certainly needed to tackle corruption, which has exacerbated inequality and held back economic growth. But was Operation Car Wash worth the pain? It helped to lever the Workers’ Party out of office, and ushered in an administration that appears just as tainted, but far less willing to promote transparency and judicial independence. So many allegations are now stacked up against Temer and his allies that he will struggle to hold on to his presidency until the end of his term in 2018. Petrobras – the national champion of the Lula era – has been brought to its knees, with foreign companies allowed to control production from the new oil fields. Major companies and mainstream politicians have been utterly discredited. Voters struggle to find anyone to believe in. It is not just the establishment that is reeling, but the entire republic.\nIn the long term, many still hope Car Wash will ultimately make Brazil a fairer, more efficient nation, run by cleaner, law-abiding politicians. But there is also a risk that the operation will shake the country’s fragile democracy to the ground and clear the way for a rightwing evangelical theocracy or a return to rule by dictators. Whether or not this purge proves a cure for Brazil will depend not just on who falls, but on who follows.\nAdditional research by Shanna Hanbury and Gareth Chetwynd.

        "text": "\nIt was only 19 months ago that the Panama Papers were released. Now, it’s the Paradise Papers that are filling the front pages of English and European newspapers. Back when the Panama Papers were released, I wrote that if David Cameron’s name hadn’t been in those documents, the news probably wouldn’t have had the same impact. Today I think that if Queen Elizabeth’s name hadn’t come up, we likely wouldn’t be discussing it either.\nThe mechanisms are the same. Only the consulting firms involved and the islands where the news originated have changed. In the Paradise Papers there’s a bit of everything: from the legitimate—though ethically questionable—creation of offshore companies to lower tax liabilities to shell companies that could hide assets of a criminal origin.\nTax havens are where criminal capitalism and legal capitalism meet and merge. I’ve said this before, but it bears repeating. So is the fact that mafia organizations were the first to create and facilitate money-laundering mechanisms through tax havens. \n\n\n \n\n\nPlay Video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n2:07\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  What are the Paradise Papers? – video\n\n\nIn the 1980s, Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela, the leader of the Colombian Cali cartel, became the largest shareholder of the First Interamericas Bank of Panama. The cartel did this in order to facilitate the laundering of drug money and its reinsertion it into circulation. \nAnd last year, it was discovered that the mansion of a top Mexican narcotics kingpin, Rafael Caro Quintero, belonged to an offshore company based in Panama, right next to the assets of major European businessmen and politicians. These assets all have diverse origins – some legal, some illegal – but they all seek the same services and enjoy the same benefits. \nPanama, Bermuda, Singapore, Cyprus, Malta—along with London at the center of this network—are all territories where you can hide money. This isn’t always illegal. In fact, when documents like the ones we saw in the Paradise Papers are leaked, the result is mostly a damage to one’s image, rather than jail time.\nHowever, reputational damage becomes less of a threat when large multinational corporations – who are household names – get away with having offshore assets. \nWhen we learn that companies like Microsoft, Google or Apple have offshore accounts – and yet neither their image nor stock prices are affected – it leads to the legitimization of this financial practice. Like a protective bubble wrap, they shield everyone else who is in on this game. Thanks to them, paying taxes is seen as only being for those who can’t afford not to pay them. \n\n\n\n\n \n\nTax havens are where criminal capitalism and legal capitalism meet\n\n\nA study by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy published this year shows that 366 of the 500 American companies with the highest revenue (those that are part of the Fortune 500) use subsidiaries located in tax havens to reduce their income taxes. Among these are important banks, financial institutes, pharmaceutical corporations, and multinational communication, clothing and food companies. \nThe result is that an electrician on the outskirts of Rome or a small business in Liverpool will have infinitely more fiscal pressure than those colossal companies earning infinitely more money. \nIn fact, it’s not a coincidence that – despite the Panama and Paradise Papers scandals and numerous governmental declarations (including by states historically considered tax havens like Switzerland and Austria) to fight tax evasion and money laundering – the quantity of wealth held offshore has grown continuously over the last few years. \nAccording to a recent study by the National Bureau of Economic Research, that wealth is now equal to 10% of the global GDP, but that’s only an estimate because the very nature of tax havens prevents the uncovering of precise figures. \n\n\n\n\nWhy have we built a paradise for offshore billionaires? | Thomas Frank\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat’s more, once certain jurisdictions are rebuked (either through political decisions or because they’re at the center of media storms), the assets they hosted are often merely transferred to new, more reputable and convenient “havens.” \nI am convinced that the Panama and Paradise Papers represent only the tip of the iceberg and that we have no idea of the true shape or size of this problem. What has come to light in both the Panama and Paradise Papers leak proves that in tax havens, cocaine money, money from tax evasion, and legal money all live together, legitimizing one another.\nLegal capitalism has learned from criminal capitalism that in the world of money, only rule-breakers survive. Drug traffickers were the pioneers of a free market model that has been slowly adopted by the legal economy. \nCocaine combined all of the pillars of contemporary capitalism: speed, globalization and economic power. Nowhere is this synthesis better in display than in offshore tax havens\n\nThis article was translated from Italian into English by Kim Ziegler\nRoberto Saviano is the author of Gomorrah, about the Neapolitan mafia, and ZeroZeroZero, about the global cocaine trade.\n\n",

        "text": "\nSome of the world’s largest broadcasters, including Fox Sports, were involved in bribe payments to Fifa officials in order to secure the broadcast rights to major South American football tournaments, a key witness in the investigation into corruption at football’s governing body has told a federal court in New York City. \nAlejandro Burzaco, the former CEO of Torneos y Competencias, a major sports marketing company based in Argentina, testified that five other companies he had partnered with, including Brazilian network Globo and the Mexican network Grupo Televisa, had bribed Fifa officials during his tenure.\nBurzaco gave evidence on the second day of the trial of three former South American football administrators, charged with accepting millions of dollars in bribes. The hearing is part of a sprawling federal investigation into endemic corruption at Fifa resulting in more than 40 criminal charges filed against football and marketing executives implicated in the global conspiracy.\n\n\n\n\nFifa corruption trial hears allegations officials took millions in bribes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBurzaco has already pleaded guilty to racketeering, wire fraud and money laundering conspiracies after he was indicted in 2015, and has since been assisting US authorities. He is one of 23 people to have pleaded guilty already. \nThe court heard how Burzaco had paid regular bribes, often six-figure sums, primarily to six senior officials of the South American football governing body, Conmebol, in exchange for the broadcast rights to the Copa Libertadores, South America’s premier international club competition. \nProsecutors homed in on the activities of T&T, a sports marketing company that has, since 2002, been jointly owned by Torneos y Competencias and Fox Pan American Sports and held the rights to the tournament.\nThe court was presented with a series of contracts between Conmebol and T&T, relating to the extension of broadcast rights for the tournament in 2008. Burzaco told the court he had paid senior officials, including the Argentinian football executive and former senior Fifa vice-president Julio Grondona and the former Conmebol president Nicolás Leoz, a range of “special bribes” ranging between $500,000 to $1m to secure the extension. The money was in addition to annual bribes, between $300,000 to $1.3m, that the six senior Conmebol officials were already receiving from T&T for the rights to the tournament.\nT&T, Burzaco said, had created a sham company to pay out the one-off cash sums. The court saw a contract between T&T and an entity named Somerton for $3.7m. \n“It’s not a real contract, sir,” Burzaco conceded as he told the court all the money had gone to pay off the officials. Burzaco noted one of the contract’s signatories was the former Fox Pan American Sports chief operating officer James Ganley. Burzaco had earlier told the court that Fox had become the majority owner of T&T in 2005. \nOn Tuesday evening, Fox responded to the allegations in court. “Any suggestion that Fox Sports knew of or approved of any bribes is emphatically false,” read a statement. “Fox Sports had no operational control of the entity which Burzaco ran. The entity run by Burzaco was a subsidiary of Fox Pan American Sports, which in 2008, at the time of the contract in question, was majority owned by a private equity firm and under their operational and management control.”\nEarlier in the day, Burzaco had also said he had paid bribes to the three former football executives on trial. \nJosé María Marín, the 85-year-old former head of Brazil’s football federation, Juan Ángel Napout, the 59-year-old Paraguayan who was president of Conmebol, and Manuel Burga, the 60-year-old former president of the Peruvian football federation, have denied multiple counts of racketeering, wire fraud and money laundering. \n",

        "text": "\nThe residents of Bell End, like many of us, hope 2018 will bring a fresh start. To be clear, I mean the residents of Bell End, the street in Rowley Regis, not Bell End, the village in Worcestershire. The latter Bell Enders probably hope it’ll be a fresh start too, but not in the same way as the Rowley Regis ones.\nThe English grammatical convention that names of places seldom take a definite or indefinite article is what prevents me from humorously clarifying that I also don’t mean the residents of a bell end – the microbes presaging a venereal disease, perhaps. But, let’s face facts: there’s no way that’s what anyone would really think the phrase “the residents of Bell End” could possibly mean. That double entendre simply will not hold together. Not even in a desperate last-minute script gagging-up session for a Carry On film would they get away with that.\nThe new beginning the residents of Bell End, Rowley Regis, are hoping for is the renaming of their street. They’re hoping for Twat Close. Of course they’re not. They want a normal name that isn’t slang for either a section of human genitalia or a person so contemptible as to be likened to one. Some of the residents do anyway – there’s a petition, currently signed by 61 people, so they’re a long way short of qualifying for a Commons debate (the BBC Parliament channel will be sorry to hear).\nI’m afraid I can’t tell you what percentage of the people who live there 61 names represents. To do that, I’d have to go there and see how big Bell End is. Once again, if only I could have said “how big the Bell End is”, that would have been amusing. But, to reiterate, it’s suspiciously unusual to use definite articles with street names. You’d spot the trick and hate me.\n\n\n\n\n \n\nFor most people, the housing ladder is dangling above their heads from an oligarch's money-laundering zeppelin\n\n\nI wouldn’t say “Let’s go shopping on the Oxford Street”, would I? “These days, there are no newspapers still based in the Fleet Street”? No. Though, oddly, I might say “The traffic is often terrible on the Edgware Road”. I don’t know why and it seems a waste as “Edgware Road” doesn’t mean penis or vagina. Or anus, for that matter. “Taking someone up the Edgware Road” has yet to catch on as an expression, probably because, as I say, the traffic is terrible. You’re much better off trying your luck in Lisson Grove.\nAnyway, I’m not going to Bell End to see how many people live there because, from the name of the place, I can only assume they’re all total bell ends.\nThat’s not what I assume. The name of their street reflects on them neither positively nor negatively and only a bell end would think it does. Even whoever named the street is blameless as the name long predates bell end’s use as an insult, which only really started in the 1990s. The road was named after the Bell End Colliery to which it used to lead. The namer wasn’t to know the British were shortly going to stop mining coal and start calling each other bell ends.\nSo why does it matter? Why change it? Why reduce the country’s quirky texture and spoil the fun of all those who travel to Bell End purely to take pictures of themselves next to the sign? I mean, what are those guys going to do without it? It really doesn’t sound like they’ve got much else in their lives.\nThat’s certainly the view of some of the residents of Upton-upon-Severn’s Minge Lane. “There has been no plan to change the name of our road,” explained Stephen Young, a 72-year-old resident. “We have had a problem with people nicking the sign but nobody is that fussed about the name. It’s a bit silly really to start a petition.”\nA stinging rebuke coming from a resident of another of Britain’s most rude-sounding streets. But, in the reluctant Bell Enders’ defence, the Minge Lane case is subtly different. Stephen Young does not live on a road simply called “Minge” and he might not be so sanguine if he did. That’s what gives Bell End its unrelenting suggestive power: the fact that there are no other words involved. No “Road”, “Avenue” or “Street”. Bell End’s name is 100% bell end, while Minge Lane is less than 56% minge.\nBut there are still Bell End fans among its residents. Roland Burrows, a curator at the Christian Heritage Centre, located on Bell End, said: “I think it’s a great name. I’ve never thought of any rude connotations at all.” And Labour councillor and Bell End householder Chris Tranter also likes it: “I was born here and lived here for 40 years and it doesn’t bother me. You get the odd giggle on the phone; it is quite amusing really.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Illustration by David Foldvari.\n\n\nTwo odd views. It’s unusually innocent not to realise Bell End sounds rude, but it’s perhaps even odder to live there for 40 years and still find it amusing. Chris Tranter must get a lot of value out of his fridge magnets. Surely, few long-term residents, even if they don’t mind the name, would have the sheer force of impish will to continue to find it funny.\nMeanwhile, the name’s downsides are more tangible. The petition cites “children being bullied and teased at school” and residents also claim that it has a negative impact on property prices: a Bell End semi would apparently fetch £60,000 less than its equivalent on nearby Uplands Avenue. That’s quite an expensive joke. I don’t blame them for wanting the council to change it.\nBut it gives me an idea of how councils can use their naming powers to alleviate the current housing crisis – in particular, the ridiculous prices in London meaning that, for most people, the housing ladder is dangling hundreds of feet above their heads from the bottom of an oligarch’s money-laundering zeppelin.\nAny political pressure on developers to build affordable housing is outweighed by the economic incentive to flog more luxury flats to the super-rich. But, if councils can name the streets, suddenly they have some power: “If you won’t build affordable housing, we have a way of making it affordable. Welcome to Nob-cheese Avenue, adjoining Hitler Lane. Go straight up Jimmy Savile’s Passage and you’re there.”\n",

He is being resisted not only by the bank but also by the US Department of Justice. \nIn letters to Judge John Gleeson filed in the eastern district court of New York, both HSBC and the DoJ have argued that the monitor’s report should not be made public.\nHSBC told the judge that Moore had not identified a public interest case for publishing the report that would outweigh the negative consequences.\nThe bank referred to arguments made in June when the DoJ set out reasons not to make the 1,000-page report public. \nCiting that submission, which was backed by regulators in four different countries, HSBC said publishing the monitor’s report would “undermine the very purpose of the monitoring by compromising the ability of the monitor and the government to assess HSBC’s progress in improving its anti-money laundering and sanctions compliance programme”.\nPublication would “negatively affect the ability of HSBC’s financial regulators to fully discharge their supervisory responsibilities over HSBC”, and would “provide criminals seeking to engage in activities such as money laundering or terrorist financing a road map for exploiting current weakness in the anti-money laundering and sanctions programme at HSBC and potentially other financial institutions”.\n\n\n\n\nHSBC, too big to jail, is the new poster child for US two-tiered justice system | Glenn Greenwald\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to documents filed with the court, Moore had a mortgage with HSBC Mortgage Services, which has since been sold to another firm. \nThe monitor covers more than 60 global affiliates.

        "text": "\nThe Guardian’s Azerbaijani Laundromat investigation (UK at heart of $3bn secret payments by Azerbaijan, 5 September) has uncovered thousands of covert payments as part of a European lobbying effort. But the article doesn’t mention the elephant in the room. Azerbaijan is particularly keen to present a positive image in Europe because it needs significant European support for its flagship project – the Southern Gas Corridor – despite the regime’s serial human rights abuses, systemic corruption and election rigging.\nThe corridor, one of the biggest infrastructure projects undertaken by the fossil fuel industry with a total cost of about $45bn, will carry gas from Azerbaijan to Europe. Powerful interests from fossil fuel corporations to European governments are pushing through this unnecessary project against the will of communities and threatening human rights and a safe climate.\nThe Southern Gas Corridor and its importance to the Aliyev regime is the missing piece of the puzzle and partly explains why the Azerbaijani regime is so heavily involved in lobbying at the European level and related money-laundering activities.Sarah Shoraka Platform, Elena Gerebizza Re:Common, Xavier Sol Counter Balance, Anna Roggenbuck Bank Watch\n• Perhaps the most concerning aspect of the latest fraud scandal to hit Britain is that it comes despite repeated government promises to crack down on those who exploit weaknesses in tax and governance laws. In 2013 David Cameron, then prime minister, pledged to put an end to tax avoidance through tougher transparency rules in the UK and our overseas territories. Yet more than four years on, the government has still not managed to fully close loopholes that enable wrongdoers to hide money and multinationals to avoid paying their fair share of tax.\nOxfam pushed for a review of Scottish limited partnerships and they are now required to publish details of company ownership, but these rules must be closely scrutinised and enforced to ensure there is no misuse of the system.\nUK-linked tax havens such as the British Virgin Islands are still sheltering corrupt money and untaxed profits by refusing to make public registers of company ownership. Tax avoidance – often through tax havens – costs developing countries billions of dollars each year that could pay for schools and life-saving healthcare. Until politicians take decisive action on these issues, the world’s poorest people will continue to pay the price.Rebecca Gowland Head of inequality, Oxfam \n• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com\n• Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters\n \n",

        "text": "\nTheresa May discussed the Paradise Papers with the leaders of 10 British overseas territories at their annual gathering in Downing Street on Tuesday, with the prime minister urging further action to combat tax avoidance.\nA cross-party group of 12 MPs wrote to the prime minister last week requesting she set a deadline for tax haven jurisdictions under British control to publish registers of the real owners of shell companies.\nMay raised the issue of public registers at the meeting, a government source confirmed, and said work on tax avoidance could help enhance reputations internationally. However, the prime minister has so far refused to endorse the measure, which was championed by her predecessor, David Cameron.\nThe annual joint ministerial council was attended by leaders from Bermuda and the British Virgin Islands, whose territories have been revealed in the Paradise Papers and elsewhere as major conduits for illicit offshore activity.\nHalf of the 240,000 shell companies represented by the law firm Mossack Fonseca, whose activities were exposed in last year’s Panama Papers and whose founders have since been arrested on money-laundering charges, were incorporated in the BVI.\nIn a statement Downing Street said the prime minister had “raised the issue of financial services, noting the increased focus on taxation and transparency that have come to the fore since the recently leaked Paradise Papers”, and asked for leadership “to show what more can be done to make further progress on the issue”.\nBut MPs led by Labour’s Margaret Hodge want the government to step in and legislate for greater transparency if overseas territories fail to make changes voluntarily. In a letter sent to the commonwealth minister, Lord Ahmad, before Tuesday’s meeting, she said: “It is our tax havens that are completely central to much of the tax avoidance, evasion and financial crime uncovered … Public registers in our overseas territories are the only way by which we can ensure that we know who owns what where.” \nA representative for Bermuda declined to comment on the meeting, saying a joint statement would be issued by the overseas territories on Wednesday.\n",

        "text": "\nThe Guardian’s report on how billions of dollars were laundered by UK companies on behalf of Azerbaijan’s ruling elite is yet another example of how Scotland has come to play a role in making dirty money clean. It’s been only four years since then prime minister David Cameron told this newspaper that he would sweep away tax secrecy, yet in Scotland an anonymous and untraceable legal entity seems to have been used repeatedly to conceal the proceeds of corruption. Scottish Limited Partnerships (SLPs), originally used for managing farming tenancies, have become the vehicle of choice in particular for Russian and former Soviet “investors” looking to hide their fortunes.\nSuch folk may want to keep money away from soon-to-be ex-wives, dodge sanctions, launder money or evade taxes. According to Transparency International 113 SLPs played key roles in a money laundering scheme that moved between $20bn and $80bn out of Russia in just four years. The secrets of the SLP’s success are that it is a vehicle with a legal personality (so it can hold assets, borrow money from banks and enter into contracts), has minimal filing requirements, pays no tax on non-UK profits and, while registered in Scotland, can be governed by “members”, or partners, in offshore tax havens. Almost three-quarters of all SLPs registered in 2016 were controlled by anonymous companies based in tax havens. The SLPs then use bank accounts in a EU jurisdiction to transfer large sums of money.\nSLPs are said to have been used as conduits for million-plus euro bribes from Azerbaijan to a former Italian politician in exchange for supporting its government over human rights abuses. This is Westminster’s domain not Holyrood’s. So far ministers have done too little, too late. True, they rushed through legislation in June that requires SLPs to name persons with significant control over them, but there’s little evidence this information will be verified. Ministers should do more. Forcing SLPs to have one registered director to be an actual person would be a start. Companies House should publish a complete data set of all members in partnerships. Publicity is a remedy for industrial diseases. Such measures will help end the murky ownership of Scottish shell companies that has facilitated financial malfeasance.\n",

        "text": "\nSainsbury’s move on Nisa seemed a good idea, and a neat response to Tesco’s much bigger plan to buy cash-and-carry merchant Booker.\nConvenience stores are the industry’s current obsession since they work well in the age of online and top-up shopping. Combining the two groups’ buying power carries a simple logic. Even when McColl’s, the chain that makes up a third of Nisa’s business signed up with Morrisons, the deal didn’t seemed dead. The terms just needed a tweak.\nNow, though, the talks have been halted – at least for the time being – because Sainsbury’s fears being dragged into the same regulatory tangle as Tesco/Booker. The Competition and Markets Authority, rightly, is taking a long hard look a merger between the two biggest players in their respective corners of the grocery market. Sainsbury’s doesn’t need similar hassle lasting many months.\nIf, when the dust settles, the business is still available, fine. If Nisa hops off somewhere else, like the Co-op, that’s not a disaster. Sainsbury’s management has better things to do currently, such as ensuring the promising reboot of Argos continues.\nCommonwealth Bank in no hurry after money-laundering claims\nIt’s not just UK and US banks, it seems, that preach a gospel of accountability in the boardroom while coming over fuzzy when it’s time to implement it.\nThe position of Ian Narev, chief executive of Commonwealth Bank of Australia, has looked impossible since the country’s crimefighting agency alleged a fortnight ago that the bank’s “intelligent” deposit-taking machines were being used by drug dealers and criminals to launder cash on a grand scale. The agency cited 53,700 breaches and called the failings “serious and systemic”.\nThe board of CBA initially reacted by blaming a software glitch. It docked a few executive bonuses but, even as the deputy governor of the central bank was making pointed criticisms, backed its man. It is only now that reality has dawned – sort of.\nNarev will depart by the end of June next year but chair Catherine Livingstone declined to make a link to the money-laundering affair; presumably she would then have to explain why he could yet serve another 10 months. Instead, there was some standard guff about succession planning.\nWould a big UK or US bank have handled things more decisively? One likes to think so but remember that no senior heads rolled at HSBC after its own money-laundering episode in 2012. At Wells Fargo in the US, chief executive John Stumpf only departed after a scandal involving bogus accounts when he was humbled by a senate committee. Meanwhile, Jes Staley stays at Barclays, but more in office than in authority until the regulator completes its investigation of his attempt to identify a whistleblower.\nSince the crisis, banks’ capital position has been transformed and the system is undoubtedly safer. The other half of the deal was meant to be an improvement in top-level accountability. It’s hard to say that has been embraced wholeheartedly. Even when they happen, changes tend to arrive slowly and grudgingly.\nIt’s all in the name for Telit\nThe Telit Communications tale is simply bizarre. The chief executive, one Oozi Cats, has resigned after the board cited evidence allegedly showing him to be the Uzi Katz indicted in a US wire fraud case dating from 1992. The board is moved to express its “considerable anger” that this fact was “knowingly withheld”.\nSomebody cheer ’em up by dispatching a copy of TS Eliot’s Old Possum’s Book of Practical Cats, with its (almost) perfect lines for the occasion: “The Naming of Cats is a difficult matter/It isn’t just one of your holiday games/You may think at first I’m as mad as a hatter/When I tell you, a cat must have three different names.”\n",

We want to educate young people about how serious this fraud is in the hope that they will think twice before getting involved.”\nCifas says there were 8,652 cases of bank accounts belonging to 18- to 24-year-olds being misused in the first nine months of this year, a 75% increase in the last 12 months. That is double the number in 2013 when there were 4,315 cases.\nExperts say one fraud asks people to reply to job adverts or social media posts that promise big sums of money way in excess of the work that will be needed.\nKaty Worobec, head of fraud and financial crime prevention, at UK finance, which represents banking and financial companies, said: “Money muling is money laundering and criminals are using young people as mules in increasing numbers. We know that students are particularly vulnerable as they are often short of cash.\n “When you’re caught, your bank account will be closed, making it difficult to access cash and credit. You could even face up to 14 years in jail. We’re urging people not to give their bank account details to anyone unless they know and trust them.

Why is the regulator, the Care Quality Commission, having to prod and cajole creditors to agree a standstill on debt repayments to prevent the business falling into administration? Why is this crisis happening only six years after the failure of Southern Cross, which at the time was the biggest company in the industry?\nOne could point to forces that are well-known. Fees are under pressure because local authorities’ social care budgets have been squeezed; overheads have been forced up by increases in the national minimum wage; and, at the margin, Brexit complicates staffing requirements. \nThose factors are real but let’s not lose sight of the ingredient at the centre of the Four Seasons affair. It’s debt – too much of it. Terra Firma, Guy Hands’ private equity firm, over-paid for the business in 2012 and loaded up with leverage. At heart, this is an old-fashioned tale of financial engineering gone wrong. Southern Cross came from the same unlovely stable – in that case, the financial error was addiction to fancy sale-and-leaseback property deals.\n\n\n\n\nCare home provider under threat as Labour attacks 'profit-first' firms\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerra Firma would be correct to plead that its debt structure was more conservative than those imposed on Four Seasons by previous owners, notably the Royal Bank of Scotland. But it’s not much of a boast.\nHands’ crew paid £825m for Four Seasons, of which about £500m was borrowed money. Look at the punishing interest payments it had to agree to find takers for the debt. There are £175m-worth of junior unsecured notes today that carry a coupon of 12.25%, and the £350m-worth of senior notes pledge to pay the bearer interest at 8.25% a year. Bond investors spotted at the outset that this was a high-risk deal in a sector with a history of financial accidents.\nWhat was Hands thinking? He thought Four Seasons was in his investment “sweet spot”, he wrote in a letter in 2014 to the Economist, which had accused him of being in too much of a hurry after his big flop with music publisher EMI. Four Seasons, said Hands, was “asset-backed, in an essential industry and in need of fundamental change”.\nWell, it was asset-backed only up to a point: 185 out of 343 homes are leasehold properties. But those other long-term virtues could only shine if the debt structure allowed room to manage through the lean years. Four Seasons’ slow march towards crisis has been flagged for months – indeed, the first mini-crisis came at the end of 2014.\nTo his credit, Hands tried to keep the financial show on the road with two extra £50m injections of capital. And, as far as one can tell, he has honoured his promises to invest in the business. In the end, though, Four Seasons has arrived at a point where it is struggling to meet a £26m debt interest payment due on Friday. H/2 Capital Partners, the US hedge fund that has bought up majority positions in both classes of debt, holds the aces. It will probably clean up at the expense of Terra Firma since, with a gentler debt structure, Four Seasons is a good business.\nH/2 should still do the decent thing and get the financial restructuring underway as soon as possible. There is no need for an administration that could cause problems for the regulator and local authorities. Get on with it.\nThe rest of us, though, can only look at the current standoff and shake our heads. The UK is awash with long-term pension fund money that would happily build and own care homes for modest real returns. Instead, we have a high-stakes financial game in which players aim for fatter rewards.\nThe result, in this case, is that control of the biggest care homes operator in the land will probably pass from a private equity outfit that made a rotten bet on financial leverage to an opportunistic US hedge fund that hunts for junk bonds to buy at a discount. It’s a shocking way to fund provision of care homes for the elderly.\nWhat happened to the old bank?\nIt’s a triumph – sort of. HSBC has avoided the threat of prosecution from US authorities over the great Mexican and Colombian money-laundering scandal that was exposed half a decade ago. The US Department of Justice monitor who has been embedded in the bank since 2013 has deemed HSBC to be much improved.\nIn truth, something would have gone seriously wrong if HSBC hadn’t received a bill of health. The bank has thrown money and thousands of staff at overhauling compliance systems. Stuart Gulliver, soon to depart as chief executive, has also extracted the bank from “high-risk” countries such as Colombia, Peru, Uruguay, Paraguay, Costa Rica, El Salvador and Honduras.\nThose clean-up actions were a correct response to the crisis. But, amid their relief at the DoJ’s move, HSBC investors will think of what might have been. A quarter of a century ago, this was the conservative bank that kept its nose clean.\n• Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.\n",

        "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/13/european-parliament-calls-for-investigation-into-azerbaijani-laundromat",
        "text": "\nThe European parliament has called for an investigation into revelations by the Guardian and media partners that Azerbaijan ran a secret $2.9bn (£2.2bn) slush fund to pay influential Europeans to paint a positive image of the authoritarian regime.\nMEPs have demanded a “comprehensive” investigation into “attempts by Azerbaijan and other autocratic regimes ... to influence European decision-makers through illicit means”, following a last-minute amendment to a report on corruption.\nIn a separate move, the head of the Council of Europe, Thorbjørn Jagland, called for unprecedented legal action against Azerbaijan over its refusal to release a political prisoner in defiance of the European court on human rights.\nThe Council of Europe and ECHR are not part of the EU, but the coincidence in timing shows how political repression and corruption in Azerbaijan is rising up the agenda of Europe’s institutions.\nJagland’s intervention centres on opposition leader Ilgar Mammadov, who was jailed for organising and taking part in demonstrations in 2013. Judges at the ECHR found he was jailed for criticising Azerbaijani authorities but the government has refused to release him.\nAt a meeting of Council of Europe ambassadors on Wednesday, Jagland called for the launch of legal proceedings against Azerbaijan for flouting ECHR court judgments – an unprecedented step in the 68-year history of the Council of Europe.\n“We cannot have political prisoners in Europe and we cannot have a situation in which Azerbaijan continues to deprive Mammadov of his liberty against the judgment of the highest court – which clearly stated his arrest and detention were arbitrary,” Jagland said in a statement released to the Guardian. “The time has come for Azerbaijan to think hard about its obligations as a member of the Council of Europe and whether it still wants to fulfil them.”\nAzerbaijan signed the European convention of human rights in 2001 but its refusal to implement ECHR rulings has contributed to a slow-burning crisis for the court.\nJagland wants to invoke the Council of Europe convention’s article 46.4, which could ultimately lead to Azerbaijan being ejected from the human rights body. This “nuclear option” has never been used before and would require action from European foreign ministers, following a court assessment.\nThe politics of the oil-rich country were also being debated in the European parliament, when MEPs voted to set up a corruption investigation by 349 votes to 290, with 42 abstentions. “Following the recent ‘Azerbaijani Laundromat’ revelations, attempts by Azerbaijan and other autocratic regimes in third countries to influence European decision-makers through illicit means [the European parliament] calls for a comprehensive parliament investigation,” the text stated.\nThe amendment was tacked on a report on corruption and human rights in non-EU countries. Drafted by Catalan MEP Jordi Solé, the amendment had been seen as a long shot unlikely to surmount opposition from the large centre-right and liberal blocs.\nIn theory, the investigation could be wide-ranging as the amendment calls for a broad inquiry into “the influence exerted by such regimes”, but it remains to be seen whether it will even get under way.\nThe European parliament has set up ad-hoc investigations into tax avoidance in Luxembourg, the Panama papers and the “Dieselgate” emissions scandal, but other calls for action have fallen on stony ground – for instance, a vote in favour of a European-Israeli-Palestinian parliamentary forum went nowhere.\nFailure to set up an investigation would damage the credibility of the European parliament, which struggles to make its voice heard on foreign policy, where it has limited powers.\nSolé said his group would push for “swift establishment” of an investigation. “We will insist that it thoroughly looks into the various responsibilities of all those involved in this massive money laundering and corruption scandal, including European banks, and holds them accountable,” he said.\n“The parliament needs to ensure that it has adequate safeguards in place to protect itself from such forms of pressure, which, ultimately, undermine our democratic credibility.”\nNo members of the European parliament have been implicated in the Azerbaijan laundromat revelations, where bank records showed multiple payments to former members of the Council of Europe’s parliamentary assembly, Pace. \nOne is Eduard Lintner, a German ex-MP and member of the Christian Social Union, the Bavarian sister party to Angela Merkel’s ruling Christian Democrats. Another is the Italian former chair of the centre-right group in Pace, Luca Volontè. \nBelgian media said on Tuesday that the trail led back to two Belgian politicians. A joint investigation by L’Echo and De Tijd found that Liberal MP Alain Destexhe and former politician Stef Goris had set up a not-for-profit election observation organisation that received $800,000 between 2012 and 2014 from Lintner. Destexhe denies being involved in the management of the organisation, while Goris said he did not receive any money from Azerbaijan.\nDestexhe is the author of a Pace report on human rights in Azerbaijan that has been criticised for not mentioning corruption.\n",

        "text": "\nCrown casino deliberately tampered with poker machines, allowed cannabis to be smoked in gaming rooms and avoided money laundering rules, whistleblowers have alleged in a video statement tabled in federal parliament.\nThe video evidence was collected by independent MP Andrew Wilkie and Senator Nick Xenophon as part of their “PokieLeaks” campaign to expose illicit practices in the pokies industry. The explosive allegations of misconduct by whistleblower staff could raise questions of Crown’s fitness to hold a casino licence.\nThe allegations of tampering were denied by Crown Resorts Ltd in a statement to the ASX on Wednesday. The company called on Wilkie to hand all material he had to the authorities.\n\n\n\n\nThe poker machine-tampering allegations against Crown in full\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThree staff appear on the video, which has been heavily altered to disguise their identity. One describes himself as a technician and another as a gaming attendant.\nThey make a number of allegations including that staff were told to use other people’s IDs to avoid reporting amounts over $10,000.\n Any transactions over $10,000 are required to be declared to Austrac, which monitors cash transactions to detect money laundering and illicit activities.\nStaff also alleged that marijuana was smoked daily in the Teak Room, the lowest of the VIP gaming rooms, and that they had been told to turn a blind eye to domestic violence by international gamblers so they could continue gambling.\nOne staff member also alleged that Crown management had them “shave down” buttons on gaming machines to allow illegal continuous play on the machines.\nUnder Victoria’s rules governing poker machines, the practice of allowing a machine to spin without a user pressing a button for each spin is banned.\nBut staff alleged they were instructed to use tools to shave down buttons on new machines to create space for punters to wedge something in the button, so it could be held in place and keep the machine playing without buttons being pressed.\n“The best tool was a Leatherman. I used a file,” one of the whistleblowers said on the video.\nWilkie said in a statement to media: “Today very serious allegations have been levelled at the poker machine industry.\n“Although the allegations focus on Crown in Melbourne, they could also suggest a broader pattern of behaviour in the poker machine industry, which would obviously have grave implications for people right around Australia. \n“If members and senators, law enforcement and regulatory agencies, and the media, scrutinise the video record of the whistleblowers’ testimony, I’m sure they’ll agree that the claims warrant an immediate and strong response.” \nWilkie tabled the allegations, including a 30-minute recorded interview with the three whistleblowers, in what is believed to be the first case of video evidence being tabled in federal parliament.\n\n\n\n\nHooked: how pokies are designed to be addictive\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Australian Greens, senator Jacqui Lambie, and the Nick Xenophon Team are now pushing for a Senate inquiry into the regulation of Australia’s casino industry.\nThe Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, said Crown should stop operating its poker machines until a “full and independent” audit had occurred. \nVictorian Greens MP Colleen Hartland has asked the Victorian ombudsman to investigate the Victorian Commission for Gambling and Liquor Regulation, which has responsibility for regulating poker machines.\nJennifer Kanis, a Maurice Blackburn lawyer, who is heading a pro bono case against Crown casino and Aristocrat Technologies Australia seeking to draw attention to misleading and deceptive conduct by poker machine manufacturers and venues, said the expose had brought to light significant new material about alleged misconduct within the industry.\nThe Victorian government began its five-yearly review of Crown casino’s licence in August.\n Crown said it rejected the allegations by Wilkie concerning the improper manipulation of poker machines and other illegal or improper conduct at Crown casino in Melbourne. \n“Crown calls on Mr Wilkie to immediately provide to the relevant authorities all information relating to the matters alleged,” the brief statement to the ASX said.\n",

        "text": "\nThe son of the French foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, has been taken into custody for police questioning in Paris as part of an investigation into forgery, fraud and money laundering.\nA preliminary inquiry into Thomas Fabius’s financial affairs was opened in France in 2013, with police paying particular attention to his purchase of a €7m (£5m) Paris flat, and how he funded it.\n A police source told Agence France-Presse the acquisition of the 285 sq metre flat in a smart area of the French capital had raised concerns over potential money laundering. It was searched by officers on Tuesday. \nThomas Fabius’s lawyer confirmed he was in custody but would not comment further.\nWhen the inquiry was opened two years ago, Fabius’s lawyer told French media the apartment had been paid for by “a deposit and a bank loan”.\nFabius, 34, who has long made headlines in France as an “enfant terrible”, is wanted in the US for allegedly writing cheques that bounced at a Las Vegas casino. He wrote cheques for more than $3.5m (£2.3m) to cover gambling debts on one night in May 2012, the day before his father became foreign minister, according to a Nevada arrest warrant seen by AFP. He could be arrested immediately if he sets foot on US soil. \nFabius is the foreign minister’s eldest son. He was three when his father, a leading Socialist, was named prime minister in 1984. \n In the past, Fabius has launched various business ventures, as well having as a short spell as a TV presenter reporting on celebrities. He has often been photographed at parties and has spent millions of dollars in casinos in the past, referring to himself as a “roulette champion”. \n In 2009, when one of his business ventures to sell chip and pin cards in Africa failed, a business partner launched legal procedings against him. He pleaded guilty to embezzling funds and was fined €15,000. \nFabius’s police questioning over the funds for his apartment came as the French parliament gave a standing ovation to his father for his part in negotiating the climate deal agreed in Paris by 196 countries. \n",

        "text": "\nThe relationship between Unesco and Azerbaijan was established long before my election in 2009. Azerbaijan, as a member of the UN and Unesco since 1992, has hosted many meetings and events, and funded and supported a range of projects in a transparent manner with the approval of the member states. I did not make the decision, as suggested by the Guardian (Report, 5 September), to organise an exhibition dedicated to this country: it was the member states who decided this. Unesco hosts throughout the year a large number of exhibitions, concerts and events all over the world. I believe Unesco’s mandate in the area of human rights has been strengthened during my tenure as director-general, particularly in the area of freedom of expression and the safety of journalists. The UN plan of action on the safety of journalists and the issue of impunity, now ratified by the UN as a whole, was one of my initiatives. Your article failed to mention my criticism of the imprisonment of two Azerbaijani journalists – Eynulla Fatullayev and Khadija Ismayilova – who received, with my support, the Guillermo Cano World Press Freedom prize, the highest Unesco distinction for journalists. I called for the release of Ms Ismayilova, and I hope my and Unesco’s actions played some small part in her release. I have worked assiduously to champion the issue of human rights and I will continue to defend the freedom of the press everywhere in the world.Irina BokovaDirector-general, Unesco\n• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com\n• Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters\n",

        "text": "\nThe former boss and chief operating officer of Afren, a London-listed oil and gas exploration business, are to be charged with criminal offences in relation to an alleged £45m fraud that led to the collapse of the £2bn company.\nOsman Shahenshah, 55, the ex-chief executive, and Shahid Ullah, 58, formerly chief operating officer, appeared in Westminster magistrates court on Tuesday charged with two counts of money laundering and two counts of fraud. They will face the charges formally on Wednesday.\nThe Serious Fraud Office said the men stood accused over payments they received via secret companies they controlled relating to over $400m of Nigeria business deals.\n\n\n\n\nBusiness Today: sign up for a morning shot of financial news\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n “The alleged fraud is claimed to have led to the collapse of the $2.6bn oil giant by their administrators, who in related civil claims are seeking damages in excess of $500m from the defendants and a Nigerian associate,” the SFO, which launched an investigation two years ago, said in a statement. \nAfren, which was a FTSE 250-listed company until it collapsed in 2015, reported itself to the SFO after details of the alleged secret payments were detailed in an independent review by the US law firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher. \nLawyers for the men did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A lawyer for Shahenshah told the FT: “My client is fully aware of the proposed charges, which are considered to be without foundation. Accordingly, they will be vigorously defended.” Ullah has previously denied the charges.\n",

        "text": "\nThe price of bitcoin has smashed through $5,000 to an all-time high.\nThe cryptocurrency rose by more than 8% to $5,243 having started the year at $966. Bitcoin has soared by more than 750% in the past year and is worth four times as much as an ounce of gold.\nBut the price has been volatile. The digital currency plunged below $3,000 in mid-September after the Chinese authorities announced a crackdown. Beijing ordered cryptocurrency exchanges to stop trading and block new registrations, due to fears that increasing numbers of consumers piling into the bitcoin market could prompt wider financial problems.\n\nPrice of bitcoin\n\nJordan Hiscott, the chief trader at Ayondo Markets, said: “The returns are truly remarkable, especially given the recent ban on bitcoin trading in China, where demand had previously accounted for at least 10% of all global volumes.”\nVladimir Putin, the Russian president, called this week for regulation of cryptocurrencies, saying their use “bears serious risks” such as money laundering, tax evasion and funding for terrorism. But he also warned against imposing “too many barriers,” which appears to have given bitcoin a boost.\nDespite warnings over a bubble, bitcoin is gaining in acceptance. Last month, a London property developer, The Collective, said it would allow its tenants to pay their deposits in bitcoin and accept rent payments in the cryptocurrency by the end of the year. \n\n\n\n\nBitcoin's price bubble will burst under government pressure | Kenneth Rogoff\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo weeks ago, Japan’s government implemented rules that recognise bitcoin as a payment method. Celebrities have also got involved, with the boxer Floyd Mayweather, the socialite Paris Hilton and the actor Jamie Foxx promoting coin offerings.\nUsing bitcoin allows people to bypass banks and traditional payment processes to pay for goods and services directly. Banks and other financial institutions have been concerned about bitcoin’s associations with money laundering and online crime because transactions take place anonymously.\nThe soaring value of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies comes despite growing warnings over a price bubble.\nThe starkest warning came from the JP Morgan chief executive, Jamie Dimon, who said bitcoin was a fraud that would ultimately blow up. Speaking last month, he said there was a limited market for the digital currency, arguing that it was only fit for use by drug dealers, murderers and people living in countries such as North Korea. He pledged to sack any JP Morgan trader investing in Bitcoin, but also admitted he had not been able to dissuade his daughter from investing.\nDimon declined to comment on the surge in bitcoin during an earnings call on Thursday. “I’m not going to talk about bitcoin any more,” he said.\nKenneth Rogoff, a professor of economics and public policy at Harvard University and a former IMF chief economist, has predicted that the technology behind cryptocurrencies will thrive, but the price of bitcoin will collapse.\n\n\n\n\nWarnings grow louder over cryptocurrency as valuations soar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“It is folly to think that bitcoin will ever be allowed to supplant central bank-issued money,” he wrote in the Guardian this week. \n“It is one thing for governments to allow small anonymous transactions with virtual currencies; indeed, this would be desirable. But it is an entirely different matter for governments to allow large-scale anonymous payments, which would make it extremely difficult to collect taxes or counter criminal activity.”\nDaniel Murray, global head of research at EFG Asset Management, noted that in 2013, bitcoin soared twelvefold in just four months but within a month had lost a third of its value and four months after its peak had lost 60% of its value.\n“Investors buy [an] asset because they are seduced by the prospect of further rapid gains without necessarily thinking about intrinsic value,” he said. He noted that historically currencies were backed by precious metals, and these days most currencies were based on macroeconomic fundamentals such as inflation, interest rates and growth, and were backed by a central bank and government. None of this applied to bitcoin, although the supply is carefully controlled.\n“It is hard to argue that bitcoin does anything better than existing currency arrangements whilst it does some things to a lower standard,” Murray added. “Individuals are already able to transact electronically using a plastic card.”\n",

        "text": "\nA former banker from Singapore accused of laundering money linked to Malaysia’s 1MDB scandal used a tax haven company as part of an $8.2m-plus splurge on Gold Coast property over little more than a year.\nYeo Jiawei’s foray into Australian property began with a $1.3m luxury oceanfront apartment in Surfers Paradise, which he bought in 2014 direct from a collapsed developer.\nGuardian Australia can reveal that Yeo is a director of a Seychelles-registered company that then paid a further $6.9m for commercial properties in Broadbeach, the tourist town’s trendy dining precinct, a year later.\n\n\n\n\nUS 'troubled' over Malaysia's detention of activist and Najib critic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralian federal police are reportedly examining whether money illegally taken from Malaysia’s 1MDB state development fund has been parked locally. That investigation includes whether any Australian citizens, residents or companies breached proceeds-of-crime laws.\nIt is not known whether the AFP is examining the properties linked to Yeo, who was sentenced to 30 months in jail last month by Singapore’s district court for witness tampering during a Singaporean investigation into the alleged laundering. \nThe court in that case heard that Yeo had acquired $6m of Australian property while allegedly playing a central role in the illicit movement of S$23.9m ($22.6m) of 1MDB funds when employed as a wealth manager at BSI Bank Singapore.\nMoney-laundering charges against Yeo are due to be heard in April, with the 34-year-old having denied committing the offences.\nProperty records in Australia show that Yeo paid $1.3m in October 2014 for a fifth-floor apartment in the Soul building, the Gold Coast’s second-tallest highrise, which overlooks Main Beach at the heart of the Surfers Paradise tourist strip.\nTwo months later a Seychelles-registered company called Connect Capital Global Investments Limited, of which Yeo is a director, obtained an Australian business number. It also registered to pay goods and services tax, indicating a predicted annual income of $75,000 or more.\n\n\n\n\n1MDB: The inside story of the world’s biggest financial scandal | Randeep Ramesh\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnect Capital is based in the Seychelles, where it was registered with the help of Offshore Incorporations, a rival of Mossack Fonseca, the company at the centre of the Panama Papers scandal that shone on a light on the secretive world of tax havens. \nIn September 2015 Connect Capital registered with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission as a foreign company, lodging documents showing its local agent is Australian Taxation Accountants in Surfers Paradise, which provides its registered office.\nThe next month Connect Capital paid $2.4m for four retail premises, now housing pizza and seafood restaurants, in the ground floor of a building in Broadbeach.\nA week before Christmas 2015 the company shelled out almost $3.4m for a further two retail premises nearby in Broadbeach, rented out to Italian and Brazilian restaurants. And four days later Connect Capital paid just over $1m for a neighbouring shopfront in the same building, leased to a doughnut business which pays more than $63,000 in rent a year.\nA spokeswoman for Australian Taxation Accountants said the company had no idea of Yeo’s legal travails and said it was a “shock” to hear of his conviction and further charges.\nThe Australian newspaper reported on Monday that AFP officers were assisting at least one of the three known authorities — in Switzerland, the US and the Singapore — that are investigating where US$3.5bn allegedly looted from 1MDB, Malay­sia’s sovereign-wealth fund, has wound up.\nAn AFP spokeswoman told the newspaper that officers were “assisting foreign law-enforcement partners in their investigations”. This included “evaluating” whether any Australian citizens, residents or companies had breached ­proceeds-of-crime laws, it reported.\n“Given this matter is the subject of evaluation, it is not appropriate to comment­ further,” the spokeswoman said.\nFederal police had not been in contact with Australian Taxation Accountants in relation to any of the properties owned by Connect Capital, a spokeswoman for the accountancy firm said.\nConnect Capital was not required to seek Foreign Investment Review Board approval for its purchases as their value was below the $252m threshold for regular commercial property deals involving developed land.\nForeign non-residents are required to seek the board’s approval to buy residential properties but are normally allowed to purchase new dwellings.\n\n\n\n\nMalaysian editors charged with 'intent to annoy' after reporting on 1MDB\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYeo’s $1.3m apartment purchase in 2014 was directly from the developer, Juniper Group, which had fallen into receivership in 2012. Developers of large projects routinely obtain “exemption certificates” to allow them to market off-the-plan apartments to overseas buyers. \n1MDB was set up by Malaysian prime minister, Najib Razak, in 2009 “to drive sustainable economic development by forging strat­egic global partnerships and promoting FDI (foreign direct investment)”.\nThe US Department of Justice alleges it was illegally drained of funds by others including Najib’s associate the Malaysian businessman Jho Low, the alleged mastermind of the scheme. \nThe US has frozen about $1.3bn in assets so far, including profits from the Hollywood film Wolf of Wall Street; a Van Gogh painting and luxury properties in New York, Los Angeles and London. It alleges in a lawsuit that Low fraudulently received US$1bn from 1MDB, laundering more than US$400m into the US where the funds were used for “the personal gratification of Low and his associates”.\nSingaporean authorities froze about $120m in assets held by Low and his immediate family last year. Low has said he occasionally consulted for 1MDB but denies any wrongdoing and he has not been charged either in the US or Singapore. Singaporean police regarded Low as a “key person of interest”, the court heard in Yeo’s trial.\nYeo’s conviction last month related to attempts to conceal his ties to Low and hide his wealth, which grew by $23.9m over just 15 months while he was a wealth manager at BSI.\nYeo denied wrongdoing throughout his trial, including the prosecutor’s claim that he received “secret profits” from a 1MDB money laundering scam.\n",

        "text": "\nA former Swiss banker has admitted paying millions of dollars in bribes to Julio Grondona, a former senior executive at Fifa, chairman of football’s world governing body’s finance committee and president of the Argentinian football association.\nJorge Luis Arzuaga, 56, who pleaded guilty on Thursday to money laundering charges following the US investigation into Fifa-related corruption, admitted opening bank accounts in Switzerland for Grondona and channelling up to $25m (£19.5m) in bribes to him and other high-ranking Fifa officials from a TV rights marketing company, Torneos, based in Argentina. Arzuaga has admitted to being paid $1.046m for facilitating this corruption, which he has agreed to forfeit to the authorities.\n\n\n\n\nRussia hopes Confederations Cup will banish 2018 World Cup concerns | Shaun Walker\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe criminal indictment of Arzuaga issued by the US Department of Justice does not identify Grondona by name, but says “Soccer official #1” was a major recipient of bribes from Torneos, in return for helping them obtain football TV rights. Soccer official #1 is described as “a high-ranking official of Fifa, Conmebol [the South America football confederation], and the Asociación del Fútbol Argentina (AFA)”, who died in 2014.\nGrondona was the president of the AFA from 1979, a key powerbroker on Fifa’s executive committee from 1988 and close ally of the former president Sepp Blatter, who praised him for his work as the chair of Fifa’s finance committee. Grondona died in 2014, aged 82. He was already identifiable in the US indictments as one of the Fifa and South American football executives accused of pocketing millions of dollars in bribes but Arzuaga’s guilty plea adds substantial detail to the accusations.\nThe indictment states Arzuaga became involved in the corrupt payment of bribes from Torneos to Grondona and other football officials as recently as 2010, when he was working at an affiliate of a Swiss bank, which is not named.\nIt states he was approached in 2010 by Alejandro Burzaco, the president of Torneos, and the unnamed boss of another marketing company, to open a Swiss bank account for Grondona. He was then introduced to Grondona as “our banker”, then proceeded to channel the payment of huge bribes to Grondona while working for the Swiss bank, and at another bank, which the indictment also does not name.\nThe indictment states Arauaga “knew it would be extremely difficult to open a bank account for Soccer Official #1 given Soccer Official #1’s reputation for corruption”, so he concealed Grondona as the recipient of the money. He regularly met Grondona to update him about how much money was in the Swiss bank accounts, the indictment states.\nBurzaco, who is accused of paying the bribes and kickbacks when securing TV and marketing rights to multiple South American football tournaments, pleaded guilty last year.\nThe Swiss office of the attorney general (OAG) said in a statement it too had concluded criminal proceedings against Arzuaga for the offences committed in Switzerland, document forgery and violation of the duty to report money laundering. His payments for those offences, $650,000, will be forfeited to the Swiss government.\nThe OAG said in cooperation with the US DOJ, it is continuing 25 separate investigations into alleged corruption committed by senior figures within Fifa, having received 178 reports of alleged money laundering, and is analysing documents amounting to 19 terabytes of data.\n",

        "text": "\nSpasiba bolshoi to glossy new BBC One thriller McMafia, which stars James Norton as Alex Godman, the English-raised scion of a family of Russian mafia exiles and which has spared us the all-too-familiar distress of actors with dodgy accents.\n“I think audiences are far too sophisticated now to have an English actor putting on a Russian accent – it feels fake,” says James Watkins, McMafia’s director and co-writer. “It was incredibly important to us to cast globally, for the authenticity … we wanted the language to be Russian, so we needed to cast Russian actors.”\nAnd not just any old Russian actors, either. Norton’s co-stars include Mariya Shukshina, AKA “the Russian Meryl Streep”, and Aleksey Serebryakov, star of the Cannes-feted, Oscar-nominated, proper Russian film Leviathan. The only non-Russian actor among this older generation is the Swedish-Danish David Dencik as Uncle Boris, but Dencik has been so assiduously developing his line in nonspecific slippery foreigners of late (see Puss in Top of the Lake: China Girl), that we must make an exception.\nStreaming means that internationally made and set dramas are increasingly common and actors’ accents ever more dicey. McMafia, which also includes plenty of subtitled Russian, is a rare sterling effort, but screen history is littered with accents so bad they either ruin it (Dominic Cooper’s Texan accent in Preacher, and, for Spanish speakers, the Brazilian Wagner Moura’s accent on Narcos) or transcend it, becoming comedy classics in their own right (Dick Van Dyke in Mary Poppins, Daphne’s supposedly Manc family on Frasier and Aidan Gillen in everything).\nMore traditional and more irritating is actors (including Americans) delivering the dialogue of non-British characters in RP English accents, as in the much-derided TV series Versailles and 2015’s BBC adaption of War & Peace. But this approach at least allows actors to emerge with some semblance of dignity. The same can’t be said of the worst possible solution: speaking English with cod foreign accents, a practice that should have died out with ’Allo ’Allo!, or certainly with Tom Hardy’s Sesame Street-influenced Soviet in Child 44. Vodka jelly shots are more authentic.\n",

        "text": "\nQuote of the week\n Carlo Tavecchio: reflecting on his record after a “media witch‑hunt” forced him out as Italy’s FA president: “Two hundred and forty people work for me here. Two hundred and forty people are in tears.”\n• His take-away message for the press, a week after Italy’s World Cup exit: papers should “publish all my achievements in football”, not keep listing his missteps. Tavecchio said talk of his four financial crime convictions; his six-month racism ban; his leaked comments about “lousy Jews” and “keeping gays away from me”; his reference to female players as “handicapped”; his call for clubs to host lap dancing venues; and new claims he sexually harassed a female executive, telling her “come here and let me touch your breasts”, which he denies, distracts from his “record of success … All [the press] ever wanted was Tavecchio on the cross.”\n\n\n\n\nUK at centre of secret $3bn Azerbaijani money laundering and lobbying scheme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElsewhere: trip of the week\nFifa 2.0’s Gianni Infantino, visiting Azerbaijan for an audience with president Ilham Aliyev. Infantino said Aliyev – who denies election fraud, a £2.2bn corruption racket and having LGBT people “rounded up” – was delivering “a real football country, in the truest sense of the word”.\nMeanwhile in New York\nAmong this month’s Fifa trial highlights so far: former Paraguay FA head Juan Ángel Napout denying taking bribes in “cash, property and Paul McCartney tickets”; and lawyers for ex-Peru FA head Manuel Burga denying he made two throat-slashing gestures at a key witness in court. Burga’s attorney said his client had just been “scratching a skin complaint”. Both deny all charges.\nBest moral lead\nFifa partner Adidas – who stayed loyal through the corruption crisis, arrests and bans – ready to take a lead if the trials go badly. “We expect from our partners that they abide by laws. If a partner is convicted we have a problem with that.”\nPlus: stoic of the week\nQatar 2022 head Hassan al-Thawadi – holding the line against new press allegations of bid corruption arising from evidence in New York. “We’ve suffered abuse – but do we ever regret bidding? No, we will never regret it. Anything of value will never come easy.”\nOther news: most got at\nLazio communications director Arturo Diaconale – still reflecting on why media “overplayed” last month’s coverage of Lazio fans mocking the Holocaust. “It’s a form of racism against Lazio. It means that now we too must adopt the mindset of a minority group, one marginalised and hurt by prejudice.” His broader message: “Lazio will fight this. We are not children of a lesser god.”\n\n\n\n\nWe need a culture shift, not just Rainbow Laces, for players to come out | Liam Rosenior\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMessage of the week\nPremier League head Richard Scudamore, launching this year’s Rainbow Laces campaign. Scudamore - sorry in 2014 for his “inappropriate banter” about “gash”, “big-titted broads” and “female irrationality” – pledged a top-down drive for “equality and diversity”: “Premier League football is for everyone, everywhere.” \nMost insulted\nPortugal’s referees’ association, threatening strike action unless players and press demonstrate they can go 20 days without “slurs implying bias or corruption”, including use of “offensive terms such as ‘octopus’, ‘padre’, ‘deacon’ and ‘golden whistler’ ... We demand serenity and respect.”\nSetback of the week\nRomania: Former Brasov owner Ioan Neculaie, jailed for two years after he reacted to a flat tyre on his car by “taking out a gun and shooting all the other tyres too”. The court heard Neculaie, who had a suspended manslaughter sentence, was “making a point to his chauffeur”.\nSpat of the week\nNicolás Russo, president of Argentina’s Lanús, accusing Brazil’s Grêmio of “foul play” in their Copa Libertadores final first-leg, including “aggressive ball boys who were 35- or 40-year-old men. One tried to punch our keeper, but he missed.”\n• Upsetting Grêmio coach Renato Gaúcho: officials missing a foul in the area (“even Stevie Wonder saw it”), and “fuss” over his use of a drone to film Lanús training pre-match. “Sure we hired a spy, it’s normal. People need to get over it.”\n\n\n\n\nDavid Squires on … Chris Coleman's excellent choice to manage Sunderland\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClarification of the week\nAlgeria coach Rabah Madjer, denying he “went too far” by stopping a press conference to tell a veteran journalist: “Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up ... retire, you enemy of Algeria.” Madjer: “I’ve done an extraordinary job, so I corrected his criticisms. I showed him no disrespect.”\nManager news: making moves\n• Germany: TSV Oldenburg chairman Erdal Sarigül, sacking coach Boris Ekmescic after a 3-1 defeat without telling him. Ekmescic said he found out while reading match reports online: “I’m glad I read it, or I’d have gone into training as usual. Seriously.”\n• Mexico, 23 Sep: Tiburones Rojos de la Veracruz president Fidel Kuri Mustieles unveiling new coach José Cardozo as heralding a “new era”: “Now we’re moving, now we’ll fight for bigger goals, battle for every ball, rise as winners. José will give us that punch we need.” 23 Nov: Sacks him.\nPlus: best attitude\nRomania: Liga IV Venus Bucharest’s keeper Emil Constantinescu, reflecting on their 26-1 defeat to Academia Rapid. “If they didn’t score the first 10 goals, I think we could have won it. But we take some positives. We get our heads up, and we go again.”\n",

        "text": "\nA former gangland boss has been ordered to pay back more than £700,000 of his criminal earnings said to have been concealed through illegal money-laundering.\nTerry Adams, the former leader of what has been described as one of the most notorious crime gangs in the UK, lost his claim in the court of appeal that he had insufficient funds to meet the demand.\nThe court heard that Adams, whose north London gang was known as the Adams family, owed an outstanding £358,562 from the confiscation order. With unpaid interest, the sum now stands at more than £700,000. Interest is charged at an annual rate of 8%. If he fails to make any further repayments he could face up to another four years in prison.\nAdams was jailed in 2007 for seven years for money-laundering following a surveillance operation that involved MI5 bugging his home. In 2014, a high court judge, Mrs Justice Nicola Davies, refused his application for a certificate of inadequacy to begin the process of getting a reduction. \nOn Monday, Lord Justice Longmore, Lord Justice Hamblen and Lord Justice Irwin in the court of appeal upheld the high court decision. \nAdams had told the judge he had so little money he felt “like a ponce” because he was living off the earnings of his wife, Ruth, an actor, and denied owning hidden assets that were funding a lavish lifestyle. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Ruth Adams leaving the Old Bailey in 2007 after her husband was jailed for seven years. Photograph: Lewis Whyld/PA\n\n\nThe Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) had opposed his application, saying there was a strong case that Adams possessed “substantial undisclosed assets”.\nBy January 2012, any identified lawful funds from the sale of their former home were exhausted, yet the couple maintained an expensive lifestyle. Adams, it was said, had not provided full and candid disclosure. \nDuring the high court hearing it was alleged that the pair spent £15,000 on flights, hotels and entertainment between August 2009 and September 2013, including a massage at the Dorchester hotel, a visit to the Ivy restaurant and 13 meals at Browns restaurant in Mayfair.\nAdams, however, has described as “laughable” CPS claims that they had an annual expenditure of £97,000. He denied he was using his wife, family and associates to create a sham income and loans to pay for visits to the opera and top restaurants, spa memberships and treatment at private clinics.\nHis counsel, Ivan Krolick, told the court of appeal that the high court judge had got it wrong against the weight of the evidence, while Kennedy Talbot QC, for the CPS, said her decision was fully justified. \nThe three appeal court judges concluded that the judge’s finding on the evidence that Adams had an undisclosed reserve of funds involved no arguable error of law and was by no means unreasonable. They rejected criticisms made of the judge’s treatment of the evidence. \n“The finding that Mr Adams had not discharged the burden of proof upon him was neither unreasonable nor against the weight of the evidence,” said Hamblen. \nNick Price, head of the proceeds of crime section at the CPS, said: “Criminals will go to great lengths in an attempt to preserve the proceeds of their crimes and Terry Adams is no exception. We have presented our case carefully and thoroughly, and I am pleased that the court of appeal has agreed that he is able to pay off this debt.\n “Attempting to hide assets and claim poverty is not a new tactic. The CPS are used to dealing with such claims and will deal with them robustly. Depriving criminals of their wealth disrupts organised crime and the CPS works closely with investigators to ensure that we can take back assets from those who look to benefit from crime.” \n",

        "text": "\nLooking back, they had known – perhaps for a long time – that it might end like this. With hindsight, says Matthew Caruana Galizia , red-eyed from emotion and lack of sleep, it seems obvious. “This wasn’t an aberration,” he says. “It was a culmination.”\nThe air in the family home in the hamlet of Bidnija, half an hour’s drive from the Maltese capital, Valletta, is thick with grief and quiet anger. Police guard the entrance to the gravel driveway and the cast-iron gates in front of the house.\nMatthew, his brothers Andrew and Paul, and their aunt Corinne sit on the sofa and a couple of old armchairs around a large, low table filled with empty coffee cups. It is a warm, comfortable, lived-in room; on another day, you might admire the view. \nBut outside, down the hill a few hundred yards away and just visible from the end of the drive, a blue and white marquee stands in the middle of a field. Figures in white overalls comb the ground around it; the road beside it is closed to traffic and lined with police cars and vans.\nThe marquee covers the remains of the Peugeot in which the brothers’ mother and Corinne’s sister, the investigative journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, was killed on Monday afternoon in an explosion so powerful that it blew the car, in pieces, into the field. \n“I was sitting at the table there,” said Matthew, himself a Pulitzer prizewinning investigative journalist. “I heard the explosion; the windows rattled, the whole house vibrated. I knew she was dead before I got up from my chair.”\nDaphne Caruana Galizia had made many enemies in the 30 years since she first began skewering alleged high-level corruption in Malta’s political, business and criminal elites – often, she would argue, one and the same, or at least closely connected – in print.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Forensic experts search for evidence on Wednesday following the death of Daphne Caruana Galizia.\n Photograph: Darrin Zammit Lupi/Reuters\n\n\nIn recent years her hugely popular blog, Running Commentary, had attacked Malta’s prime minister, Joseph Muscat, his chief of staff, Keith Schembri, and Konrad Mizzi, the then energy minister, tying offshore companies allegedly linked to the three men to the controversial – and highly lucrative – sale of Maltese passports and large payments from the government of Azerbaijan. \nBut the targets of her cutting, sometimes savage posts covered the full spectrum of graft, cronyism, corruption and organised crime, taking in politicians (including from the opposition), banks aiding money laundering and tax evasion, online gaming firms infiltrated by the mafia and drug smugglers. \nMuch of her – and Matthew’s – work since last year had focused on revelations from the Panama Papers, a huge cache of leaked documents from the leading offshore law firm Mossack Fonseca. But long before then, her sons recall, she was being relentlessly harassed and intimidated.\n“In 1996, the front door was set on fire,” says Andrew, who works now in the Maltese diplomatic service. “Around about that time, too, someone killed the dog – cut its throat and laid it across the doorstep. A few years later, the neighbour’s car burned out; his house has almost exactly the same name as ours.”\nThe most serious attack before Monday’s fatal car bomb was in 2006. Paul, now a fellow at the London School of Economics, was coming home late, around two in the morning, and saw “a huge blaze, right beside the house. They’d dumped two big stacks of car tyres, filled them with petrol, and set light to it.”\nPaul reached the house just in time to stop the fire taking hold of the building and to wake his parents, who were asleep inside, oblivious. “That was the first really serious attempt to physically harm her,” Paul says. “The clear intention was to burn the house down, with her inside it.”\nDeath threats were almost a daily occurrence, says Matthew: “We grew up with them. Phone calls, letters, notes pinned to the door. Then when mobile phones arrived, text messages. And later of course, emails, comments on her blog. Not to mention the lawsuits. So many lawsuits.” \nThere was “a concerted attempt to ruin her financially”, adds Andrew. “The libel threshold in Malta is low, and to respond – simply to say you’re contesting it – you have to pay something like €900 into court. They came at her like that in groups, businessmen, politicians, often with foreign lawyers.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Candles are lit in memory of Malta’s Daphne Caruana Galizia in Brussels, Belgium on Wednesday. Photograph: Yves Herman/Reuters\n\n\nThis year alone, says Matthew, counting off the names on his fingers, “15 – no, maybe even 20 people” filed for libel against his mother. One guy, a wealthy businessman, “filed 19 suits, one for every sentence in one of her articles”. \nWith the support of their father, her husband Peter, a “completely unflappable” lawyer, Daphne Caruana Galizia nonetheless gave her sons “a normal childhood”, says Matthew. “We were her priority, always,” he says.\n“But she remained capable of outrage. That’s the thing. She never, ever became cynical. Despite all she knew about everything that’s rotten in this country, she never became cynical.” And there are things about Malta, this family now knows, that smell very rotten indeed.\nThey outline, in detail, cases of investigations not pursued, of reports suppressed, of honest law enforcement officials threatened and inquiries quashed, on the orders of politicians. \n“There has been,” says Matthew, “a takedown of the rule of law here. There has been capture of the state by corrupt and criminal corporations. The institutions do not work. There is a climate of impunity.” \nIn recent years Malta has been called a “pirate base for tax avoidance”, helping multinational companies dodge nearly €15bn in tax. Organised crime, including Italy’s ’Ndrangheta, uses one of its major industries – online betting, which accounts for 10% of the island’s GDP – for large-scale money-laundering, according to Europol. \nThe country’s biggest source of revenue is now selling Maltese citizenship and passports, which cost €650,000 each, to very wealthy foreigners. In the past 10 years, it has witnessed 15 mafia-style killings, including five car bombings in the past two years. All in a member state, the smallest, of the EU.\nDaphne’s family are not confident her death will change any of this. “It will take other people,” says Matthew. “Part of what led to this is that no one else did anything. They shrugged their shoulders. In a normal country, a failure of the state would be recognised, the institutions of civil society would move in, fix things. But what can move in here? This is not a normal country.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  The wreckage of the car belonging to Daphne Caruana Galizia. Photograph: Rene Rossignaud/AP\n\n\nIn Malta, says Paul, the prime minister appoints the magistrates, the police commissioner, the justice minister and – jointly – the attorney general. “This is an institutional problem,” he says. “There aren’t the normal checks. Here, if the government doesn’t want to be investigated, it won’t be investigated.” \nSo their mother’s death, say her sons, was not an isolated attack on freedom of expression, but a symptom of something else: a system. “These things don’t happen by accident,” says Andrew. “This state of affairs was cultivated. If a journalist dies, it’s because people are not doing the job they’re supposed to do.”\nOther people, adds Corinne, need to step up now. “Everyone – including other journalists, media we know are sitting on big stories – needs to do their job. Malta has become the useful tool of international criminal networks, and there was just one nuisance, my sister, telling everyone it was happening.”\nIt is important, of course, that Daphne Caruana Galizia’s killer – or killers – are found. But in a way, says Matthew, “it’s almost irrelevant. So many people wanted her dead, so many benefit. People say, ‘I hope they find the bastards.’ But we know where the bastards are. They are in government. They’re on the TV. And they all, in part, bear responsibility.” \n",

        "text": "\nThe Prince of Wales Charitable Foundation, the grant-making body founded by Prince Charles, has more than halved its donations to causes in the last year as the royal heir takes on more of the Queen’s responsibilities.\nAccounts in a report filed by the foundation to Companies House show that the total provided to worthy causes dropped to £3.1m in the 12 months till March 2017 from £7.7m in 2016.\n“The Prince’s charities are periodically reviewed to ensure they continue to deliver the greatest benefit possible for the people that they have been set up to help,” a Clarence House spokesperson said.\n“The approach of the prince’s 70th birthday [on 14 November] provided a sensible opportunity to review his charities to ensure that they continue to deliver the maximum benefit for those people they were set up to help. \n“The review was also designed to ensure the prince’s personal involvement was at the right level and had the right focus,” they added.\nThe Companies House report said there had been a strategic review throughout the year and it was expected that plans to award new grants would be developed next year since the body had met its free reserves target of £7.5m.\nIt said: “The purpose of the review was to ensure that the structure of the charities and HRH’s ongoing involvement in supporting and promoting their work, was optimally positioned for the future.”\nThe prince has now spent longer as heir to the throne than any other heir apparent in the history of the British monarchy. He attended 546 engagements in the past year, more than any other member of the royal family. \nMeanwhile the Queen, 91, is delegating more of her responsibilities as she seeks to lower her workload. Earlier this year her husband, Prince Philip, 96, retired from public life.\n\n\n\n\nPrince Charles accession 'could trigger debate on disestablishment'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is understood Charles will attend this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia in place of his mother.\nAlmost half the charitable foundation’s income comes from Duchy Originals Ltd, the organic food brand sold in Waitrose, and AG Carrick Ltd, its trading arm, named after the pseudonym used by Charles to display his watercolours.\nDonations from the companies, which are both ultimately owned by the heir, remained steady; however, donations from other sources – which allow the foundation to dispense donations on their behalf – fell, resulting in a 15% decrease in income overall.\nThe foundation gives to a variety of organisations including those related to environmental conservation, educational initiatives and agriculture development. It says it aims to transform lives and build sustainable communities.\nIt was founded in 1979 and works with the 13 charities that make up the Prince’s Charities Group. Others include the Royal Drawing School and the British Asian Trust.\nClarence House elicited controversy in 2011 when it was found AG Carrick made no charitable donations in 2011 despite turning over £4.35m in the two years prior.\nIn 2010, the Prince’s Foundation for Integrated Health, the health charity of which Charles was president, was wound up by its trustees following an alleged fraud and money-laundering scandal at the organisation.\n",

        "text": "\nHSBC, which I have personally banked with since 1964, recently announced that it will close the four accounts we hold for the campaign organisation Searchlight following a “review”. In a follow-up email it insisted there is nothing we can do to change the decision and that it will not give us a reason.\nSearchlight has campaigned against racism and fascism for 52 years, published a magazine since 1975, and is well respected. We are not aligned to any political party and are multi-faith. We currently work with the University of Northampton and recently launched a research arm, Searchlight Research Associates, with many distinguished patrons.\nWe have no overdraft facility – our income comes from occasional grants, donations and subscriptions and is paid in by cheque, standing order or bank transfer. We have hardly any international transactions. We can think of nothing in our use of the accounts that could possibly give rise to any concerns. \nThe only reason I can think of is that the fascist individuals and organisations that Searchlight combats have maliciously given false information to the bank for the sole purpose of getting our accounts closed, and the bank has accepted it without investigation. Obviously, this is very disruptive and we are applying for new accounts with another bank but we don’t know whether it will accept our application in view of HSBC’s action. Although HSBC is acting within its terms and conditions, its unilateral action is contrary to all principles of justice. GG, Ilford, Essex\nThere’s nothing you can do to change the decision, says HSBC – except write to the media. As soon as I contact the bank you receive a flurry of phone calls and then two senior officials beg a meeting. The upshot is that the four accounts are reinstated with no more of an explanation than when they were closed. Its press office will only comment opaquely: “HSBC aims to provide the highest standard of customer service … where this has not been met we endeavour to work closely with the customer to resolve any issue as soon as possible.”\nAbrupt closure of bank accounts without explanation is becoming a worryingly frequent issue in my inbox as banks run scared of draconian US crackdowns on anyone deemed complicit in money laundering. HSBC narrowly avoided prosecution by the US Congress, so the chances are it is neurotically reacting to any account with political overtones or foreign transactions, be it owned by a suburban householder or a high-profile campaigning group.\nYou’re lucky. Very rarely in my experience do the banks capitulate and reverse their decisions, however mystifying.\nIf you need help email Anna Tims at your.problems@observer.co.uk or write to Your Problems, The Observer, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.

        "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/23/uk-money-laundering-checks-inadequate-transparency-international",
        "text": "\nAccountants, estate agents and art dealers who breached money-laundering rules were fined an average of just £1,134 last year, according to a report that says the UK’s anti-money laundering controls are not fit for purpose.\nThe report, Don’t Look, Won’t Find, by Transparency International, an anti-corruption NGO, also found that 15 of the 22 regulators it examined also lobby for the companies they oversee, creating potential conflicts of interest.\nThe findings will boost concerns that safeguards to prevent corrupt money being laundered through or into the UK are insufficient. Last month, the government’s first national risk assessment of money laundering found banks and other financial institutions were at “high risk” of exposure to corrupt funds.\n“Given that the prime minister has rightly said that dirty cash is not welcome in the UK, it is appalling that a shambolic system is failing to stop that flow,” said Rachel Davies, a senior advocacy manager at Transparency International. \n“Corrupt individuals are still finding the UK to be a safe haven for their ill-gotten gains and the vast majority of institutions that are meant to prevent that from happening are not up to the job. The average house price in central London is more than the total amount of fines dished out to those who laundered money through property last year.”\nThe organisation is calling for the government to consider stripping the 22 watchdogs of their responsibilities and creating a single regulator to ensure UK commercial firms are not assisting the corrupt.\nAlthough most closely associated with the banking sector, where failure to properly control for money laundering risks has resulted in large fines in recent years, a range of professional services sectors – including accountants, lawyers, estate agents, high-value dealers and art and auction houses – are required to observe due diligence controls to ensure their services are not unwittingly provided to criminals. Each sector has its own regulator; sometimes there are several possible ones.\nBreaches of AML procedures can involve not checking the identity of clients, failing to carry out sufficient due diligence on a client or the source of their wealth, or failing to notify the National Crime Agency when suspicious activity is detected, as companies are required to do.\nResponsibility for issuing punishments falls to whichever regulator oversees the company in question. The majority publish no information about the fines they issue, and the government refused to provide individual regulators’ annual reports to Transparency International on the grounds it would compromise the commercial interests of the regulators, the NGO said.\nWhile HMRC told Transparency International it had issued 677 penalties worth a total £768,000 in 2014-15, it refused to say which firms it had fined or why the fines were issued, and refused to break down the total by sector.\nSeveral of the regulators are also affected by potential conflicts of interest that could interfere with their willingness to tackle money laundering within their sector, according to the report.\n In October, in its assessment of the UK’s vulnerability to money laundering, the government warned that almost all the regulatory organisations are also lobby groups for the sectors they oversee or are funded by the companies they would be obliged to investigate.\nFifteen of the 22 regulators, including the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW), failed to separate their lobbying and supervisory roles, according to Transparency International. The ICAEW said it agreed that more needed to be done to reinforce the value of effective AML procedures, but it added that it had recently established a regulatory board to enhance further “the distinction between ICAEW’s representative and regulatory roles.” \nSome sectors are also failing to submit suspicious activity reports (SARs) to the National Crime Agency when their due diligence procedures identify possible criminality, the report found. While 320,000 SARs were submitted by financial services firms between October 2013 and September 2014, other sectors submitted vanishingly small numbers of reports within the same time period.\nJust 179 SARs were filed by estate agents, despite widespread recognition that the UK high-end property sector has become a target for money laundering. At least £180m of UK property is subject to criminal investigation, and David Cameron has pledged to bring in transparency measures in an effort to force corrupt money out of the sector. \nThe report also found an absence of individual accountability in companies where breaches had occurred. Last month, the government watered down plans to make named executives at financial firms personally responsible for regulatory failure.\n",

        "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/sep/28/former-bbc-chair-rona-fairhead-given-ministerial-post",
        "text": "\nThe former chair of the BBC Trust Rona Fairhead has been appointed as an international trade minister with a life peerage, Downing Street has announced.\nFairhead will replace Mark Price, the former Waitrose managing director who quit after a year as trade policy minister. The MP Greg Hands has taken over the policy role, and Fairhead’s title will be minister for trade and export promotion.\nFairhead was the chief executive of the Financial Times Group before taking on the BBC role, from which she resigned after Theresa May indicated that she would have to reapply for the job to which she had been appointed by David Cameron.\nFairhead was the chair of HSBC’s audit committee when the bank admitted to “past compliance and control failures” in the group, after it was mired in a tax avoidance row uncovered by the Guardian’s HSBC files investigation.\nUnder questions from the culture, media and sport select committee, Fairhead defended her role at HSBC, but admitted to failings related to the record-breaking $1.9bn (£1.4bn) fine levied on the bank by US authorities in relation to money laundering in its Mexican branch.\nThe Labour MP Margaret Hodge, the then chair of the public accounts committee, said Fairhead should resign from her BBC post after the HSBC revelations.\nOn Thursday, Hodge said it was “outrageous” that Fairhead had been given a ministerial role, telling the Guardian it was “not down to her capabilities”.\nHodge said Fairhead had a good relationship with senior Tories, including Alan Duncan and Michael Portillo, who had defended her while she was under scrutiny for her role at HSBC.\n“It shows it is all about who you know, rather than what you know. It is all about being a member of the establishment,” she said.\nFairhead’s appointment to the ministerial role by Downing Street will come as a surprise to many, after she was effectively forced out by May after the latter became prime minister last summer. \nCameron’s decision to ask Fairhead to stay on as BBC Trust chair during the corporation’s transition to being governed by a single, powerful board was criticised by some, who thought its governance needed a fresh start.\nHer short tenure drew disapproval from within the BBC for reportedly failing to effectively defend the broadcaster during the negotiations leading up to the white paper on BBC charter renewal.\nIn particular, she was criticised for agreeing to an 11th-hour financial settlement in July 2015 that forced the BBC to shoulder the cost of supplying free TV licences to people over 75, which was previously funded by the taxpayer.\nShe was replaced by Sir David Clementi as BBC chair under a new governance structure in which the trust was replaced by a unitary board.\nFairhead will replace Price in the department of the international trade secretary, Liam Fox. Price quit in early September, voicing doubts about the government’s direction on Brexit. He said voting to leave the EU had been “a symptom of people’s concerns about their day-to-day problems. Brexit will not solve those problems.”\nAnnouncing Fairhead’s appointment, Fox said: “As we forge closer trading links with new markets and respond to the massive appetite for British goods and services across different sectors, Baroness Fairhead’s focus and wealth of business experience will help us get more UK companies exporting.”\nFairhead said Brexit was “a time of unprecedented new opportunities for UK trade … I am keen to help ever more UK businesses capture the global demand for their goods and their services. I look forward to working with companies across the UK to forge a culture of success in exports in businesses large and small.”\nNo 10 also announced that Theodore Agnew, the businessman and Tory donor who was the sponsor of the Inspiration Trust academy chain, will become a minister in the Department for Education (DfE) and get a life peerage. Both posts will be unpaid.\nAgnew was a key ally of the then education secretary Michael Gove during his time in the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government. \nInspiration Trust has announced that he will stand down as its chairman following his appointment.\n Agnew has donated more than £100,000 to the Tories and served as a non-executive director at the DfE during the coalition, as chair of its academies board.\n",

        "text": "\nNew EU tax measures make it harder for the UK to keep its head in the sand when it comes to tax transparency for its overseas territories and crown dependencies (Firms forced to reveal real owners in tax evasion fight, 16 December). Given that Gibraltar – a UK overseas territory, and reported tax haven – will now fall under the same scrutiny as other members of the EU, the UK should ensure that the rest of its overseas territories follow suit and introduce public registers of beneficial ownership. Poor countries lose an estimated $170bn a year when individuals and companies hide their money to reduce their tax bills. Accepting an amendment to the current sanctions and anti-money laundering bill in the new year would be an easy way for the UK government to make good on its promises, and help developing countries claim back taxes to help improve the lives of the world’s poorest people.Rebecca GowlandHead of inequality, Oxfam GB\n• When the BBC and the Guardian v offshore agents Appleby comes to court (Guardian to fight legal action by Paradise Papers firm, 19 December), presumably all participants – tax collectors, lawyers, judges, bankers, book-keepers, auditors, tax-planners, company-formation agents and expert witnesses – will have to declare any conflicts of interest, such as their own tax-haven and offshore arrangements.Noel HodsonDirector, Tax Reconciliations, Oxford\n• Re “A Christmas story Dickens would struggle to believe” (18 December). How about a new bonus tax different from ordinary income tax? Standard rate of 50% for first £5m; 60% for £5m to £10m; 80% for £10m to £50m; and 90% for over £50m? Tax to be introduced for bonuses paid in 2017-18 financial year and subsequent years.Chris DodwellTruro, Cornwall\n• I’m sure we all agree with Nils Pratley (Binary options a sham, 19 December), when he commends our financial regulators for making moves to impose some sort of order in a wild west corner of the financial market. Perhaps it is also now time for our tax authorities to consider why they fail to impose appropriate taxes on these financial products – betting taxes on binary options and contracts for difference and insurance taxes on credit default swaps.Nick LilwallEdinburgh\n• It is very good to read that you are to defend yourselves against Appleby, but so typical a reaction from the rich and influential to attack as they are. Attack is, allegedly, the best form of defence but this sounds more like a vindictive and politically motivated attempt at destabilising future confidence in journalistic integrity in the UK’s media rather than countering the actual revelations from the Paradise Papers. So let us hope that by defending this action your journalistic integrity remains intact. In this respect you certainly have my support.Gary BennettExeter\n• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com\n• Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters\n",

        "text": "\nThe Maldives has announced it will leave the Commonwealth after mounting pressure from the 53-nation group over corruption and deteriorating human rights in the Indian Ocean state.\nThe country’s government, which has been fending off rumours of an impending coup and allegations of money laundering, said the decision on Thursday to cancel its membership was “difficult but inevitable”.\n\n\n\n\nMaldives newspaper raided after corruption claims against president\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIts foreign ministry said in a statement it had been treated “unjustly and unfairly” by the organisation’s Commonwealth ministerial action group (CMAG), which has been scrutinising the government since the former president, Mohamed Nasheed, was ousted in 2012 in what his supporters say was a coup.\n“The CMAG and the Commonwealth secretariat seem to be convinced that the Maldives, because of the high and favourable reputation that the country enjoys internationally, and also perhaps because it is a small state that lacks material power, would be an easy object that can be used,” the statement said.\nIt added that it was being targeted “in the name of democracy promotion, to increase the [Commonwealth’s] own relevance and leverage in international politics”.\nOn 23 September the Maldives government was officially put on notice by CMAG and given six months to address concerns including the detention and prosecution of opposition leaders, meddling with the judiciary and undermining democratic institutions. \nIt was the third time the country had been threatened with partial or full suspension from the Commonwealth since Nasheed, the country’s first democratically elected president, was forced out. He was replaced by the current president, Abdulla Yameen, in a 2013 poll widely regarded as dubious. \nA September report (pdf) by the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative (CHRI), an independent NGO, found “further evidence of curbing fundamental rights, targeted persecution of opposition leaders [and] misuse of state institutions (including the judiciary, legislature and the police) to restrict, crush and punish dissent”.\n“It’s a sad day,” said David White, the chief of the CHRI. “We did call for them to be suspended, but that was in order to call for more support for the Commonwealth to push for political reform.”\nA spokeswoman from the CHRI’s Delhi office said the decision to end the Maldives’ 34-year Commonwealth membership was a way of “saying you’re no longer committed to democracy and rule of law”.\n“It’s a huge setback to civil society and the democracy movement,” she said. “The national institutions are really failing, the entire democratic structure that the country committed to in 2008 is under threat.” \nThe Commonwealth secretary general, Patricia Scotland, said: “The Commonwealth family at large [will] share my sadness and disappointment at this decision. \n“The Commonwealth charter reflects the commitment of our member states to democracy and human rights, development and growth, and diversity. We will continue to champion these values and to support all member states, especially small and developing states.\n“Therefore, we hope that this will be a temporary separation and that Maldives will feel able to return to the Commonwealth family and all that it represents in due course.”\nThe archipelago, best known for its luxury tourist resorts, transitioned to democracy in 2008 after the end of 30 years of autocratic rule by Maumoon Abdul Gayoom.\nBut the ascension in 2013 of Yameen – Gayoom’s half-brother – has led to regular political crises and the prosecution of political figures, including Nasheed last year on terrorism charges Amnesty International said were politically motivated. The former president received political asylum in Britain in May. \nA former vice-president, Ahmed Adeeb, was convicted in June of trying to assassinate Yameen by planting a bomb on his speedboat.\nThe government was recently rocked by a documentary, broadcast by al-Jazeera, alleging Yameen and other senior government members had been involved in money laundering and tampering with judges, among other crimes. They have denied the allegations.\nIslamic extremism is also thought to be a growing problem, with up to 100 Maldivians – from a population of 300,000 – believed to have left the country for Syria as of January 2015.\n",

        "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jul/12/cyber-a-growing-risk-to-australias-financial-markets-report-finds",
        "text": "\nAustralia’s multibillion-dollar financial markets are vulnerable to an increasing risk of cyber-enabled fraud, a new report has found. \nOverseas-based crime syndicates are also exploiting Australia’s financial infrastructure to manipulate markets and launder money, the report by Austrac, the government’s financial intelligence agency, found.\nAustrac said the risk of criminal exploitation of the nation’s securities and derivatives sector was “at the high end of medium”. \nAustrac’s work relied on an analysis of 663 reports of suspicious activity from the corporate sector, made by 68 entities. About half the reports involved suspected fraud. \n\n\n\n\nAsic says requests to upgrade ageing corporate database denied by governments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAustrac warned the shift to online trading had heightened the risk of cyber-enabled fraud, which was increasing in both “volume and the level of sophistication”. About half of all fraud reports involved cyber fraud, it said. \nSuch fraud could involve hacking an online trading account and using it to conduct trades or siphon off funds. \n“In some cases this activity was enabled by fraudsters finding out the answers to the customer’s security questions by trawling through the customer’s social media,” the report found. \nCyber fraud could also involve hacking a business email to send fraudulent instructions to a financial institution to transfer client funds or close a trading position. Roughly one-fifth of the reports to Austrac involved cases of money laundering, and 13% related to insider trading. \nConcerns about the financing of terrorism were low, at less than 1%. Only a “very small number” involved politically exposed persons. \nAlmost a third of the reports named foreign companies or individuals who were trading on Australia’s financial market. The report also identified the use of overseas-based agents and third parties in trading as a “significant vulnerability”. \nThe report named China, the UK, Hong Kong and Canada as areas of particular risk, the acting Austrac chief executive, Peter Clark, said. \n“Australia has a very large and liquid financial market,” he said. \n“It’s the second largest market in the Asia-Pacific in terms of trading. So you would expect that a lot of the countries that are of interest to us are in this region – that’s no surprise.”\nLaunching the report on Wednesday, the justice minister, Michael Keenan, said protecting financial markets from crime was “not just a matter for government”. \nHe said the private sector needed to take steps to address the vulnerabilities. \nBut he rejected suggestions that the Australian Securities and Investments Commission lacked the resources to police the sector. A review last year found the corporate regulator was under-resourced and suffering from cultural dysfunction. \nKeenan said the federal government had “some pretty serious firepower” to combat corporate crime, pointing to its investment in the serious financial crime taskforce, which brings Asic, intelligence agencies and law enforcement together. \n“They are having great success,” Keenan said. \n“I mean about $200m in tax liabilities, over $100m in criminal proceeds – that is some pretty serious firepower that we have brought to the fight against fraud and corruption and people who are doing the wrong thing.”\nThe report found complex ownership structures were being used to cloud the identity of those committing insider trading, market manipulation and money laundering. \nAustralians were also using foreign entities to obscure their identity to commit illegal activity. \n",

        "text": "\nA home improvement company in the Hamptons, New York, is on the list for more than $5m. An antique rug store in Alexandria, Virginia, is down for almost $1m. A men’s clothing store in New York: $849,215. A clothing store in Beverly Hills, California: $520,440. A contractor in Florida: $432,487.\nAn indictment unsealed on Monday morning lists dozens of alleged payments by Paul Manafort, Donald Trump’s former campaign chairman, to stores and businesses since 2008. In nearly all the transactions, cash flowed from accounts in tax havens such as Cyprus and St Vincent and the Grenadines.\nFor years, the transglobal torrent of money drenched luxury retail outlets and real estate offices from New York to California and back again, the indictment says. Art galleries, landscapers, car dealerships – none of the retailers seem to have checked very carefully where the cash came from. \n\n\n\n\nHow Trump's campaign chief got a strongman elected president of Ukraine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmid the shopping sprees, Manafort himself returned frequently to the alleged sources of his fortune in the former Soviet bloc. The consultant-for-hire had set up shop at 4 Sophia Street in Kiev back in 2005, as Ukraine struggled through waves of election, revolution and reverses. \nThere, Manafort found high demand for his skills as a former Washington lobbyist for some of the world’s most notorious despots – Zaire’s Mobutu Sese Seko, the Philippines’ Ferdinand Marcos and Angolan rebel Jonas Savimbi among them. Soon, his sphere of operation came to include members of the Russian oligarchy.\nBut none of those clients was as significant as the one waiting in his future: Donald Trump. For five months in the spring of 2016, as Trump scrambled to lock down a resistant Republican party, Manafort stepped in as campaign chairman, offering all the street smarts that 40 years of selling advice out of a briefcase had taught him.\nManafort’s partnership with Trump appears to have ended for good on Monday, when Manafort surrendered at FBI headquarters, without a word from the president in his defense. Along with a former business partner, Rick Gates, Manafort faces federal charges including conspiracy, money laundering and tax evasion.\nNone of the cash that helped Manafort “enjoy a lavish lifestyle” had made a stop at the Internal Revenue Service, prosecutors claim.\nIt seems a dazzling fall for a man who just one year ago was on the verge of celebrating one of the greatest political upsets of all time, the election of Donald Trump as president of the United States. Manafort might have hoped the victory would deliver him from legal peril – and it could yet, given the president’s powers to grant pardon.\n\n\n \n\n\nPlay Video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1:24\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Paul Manafort’s attorney calls charges 'ridiculous' – video\n\n\nBut the conversion of a campaign chairman to potential felon represents a criminal crisis of historic dimensions for US politics, and the culmination of a presidential campaign story that seems out of place for American democracy – even as it seems of a perfect piece with the nominee. \nManafort, 68, began his career in politics in 1976, working as a field lieutenant on the floor of the Republican national convention to stave off an attack on the incumbent president, Gerald Ford, by an upstart called Ronald Reagan.\nFour years later, Manafort was working for Reagan, and directly after his 1980 victory, Manafort opened a lobbying firm with the future Trump adviser Roger Stone, Charles Black and, later, Peter Kelly. The firm came to specialize in cultivating favors in Washington on behalf of foreign clients with difficult images.\n“Black, Manafort, Stone and Kelly lined up most of the dictators in the world that we could find,” Stone said in a podcast last year. “Pro-western dictators, of course. Dictators are in the eye of the beholder.”\nA 1992 Center for Public Integrity report placed the firm atop its rankings of a group it called “the Torturer’s Lobby”. Manafort, who has denied all wrongdoing, has said that his consulting work helped to achieve victories for democracy in otherwise out-of-reach places. \nTrump liked Manafort’s sales pitch. In February 2016, the real estate tycoon had already won three stunning victories in state primary contests, but the campaign feared the Republican party would find a way to rob Trump of victory at the last minute, at the national party convention. \nGiven the comparative placidity of recent presidential contests, almost no one had relevant experience of herding delegates in a convention setting, with one notable exception: Manafort.\nManafort’s CV was a perfect fit for Trump. But for a candidate who prized personal loyalty above all else, even more important was Manafort’s status as a downstairs neighbor. In 2006, Manafort had spent $3.7m on an apartment in Trump Tower in Manhattan.\n\n\n\n\nPaul Manafort: why Trump's old ally could hold the key in Mueller's Russia hunt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump hired Manafort, who quickly rose to the level of campaign chairman. Trump secured the presidential nomination. And then, with a reality TV showman palpably close to the presidency, everything came under a microscope as it never had before.\nManafort did not last long under the scrutiny. It emerged that a handwritten ledger recovered from the home of the former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych listed $12.7m in payments to Manafort’s company. As questions mounted about Manafort’s undisclosed work for Kremlin-linked political interests, he was forced to step down from the campaign, just one month after the convention euphoria. \nUnder pressure from investigators, Manafort registered as a foreign agent in June 2017 – but by then it was too late. Reports had emerged that special counsel Robert Mueller was scrutinizing Manafort on suspicion of money laundering. A month later, FBI agents stormed Manafort’s home in a pre-dawn raid, seizing computers and documents. \nAt the time, Trump spoke in Manafort’s defense.\n“I’ve always found Paul Manafort to be a very decent man,” Trump said at the time. “He’s like a lot of other people, probably makes consultant fees from all over the place, who knows, I don’t know.\n“But I thought it was pretty tough stuff.”\n",

        "text": "\nRobert Mueller’s investigation into whether the Trump campaign conspired with the Kremlin to try to sway the 2016 presidential election has cost taxpayers $3.2m over its first four months.\nThat is roughly the same estimated cost as a single presidential golfing trip to Mar-a-Lago.\nThe office of the special counsel released on Tuesday its details of expenditures from May to the end of September. The biggest amount for the team of lawyers and investigators who are looking into the presidential campaign is personnel costs: $1.7m.\n\n\n\n\nTrump's personal banking information handed over to Robert Mueller\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cost of the investigation is significantly higher – a total of $6.7m in that same period – when other expenses that are related to the investigation that were paid for by the DoJ directly were taken into account.\nThe office said those expenses would have been paid as part of the federal investigation into the possible Russia conspiracy regardless of whether or not the special counsel was involved. The special counsel office was set up in the wake of the firing of James Comey, the FBI director, by the White House.\nComey’s dismissal is believed to be one of the subjects Mueller is investigating.\nThe office is paid for by an “indefinite appropriation” at the Department of Justice, which is dedicated to funding special counsels.\nThe other high cost was travel: $223,643 for special counsel staff to travel and, in some cases, relocate in order to do their jobs.\n\n\n\n\nWas Michael Flynn asked to wear a wire in Mueller hunt for evidence on Russia?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report revealed that the office has contracted out several important functions, including IT services ($111,245), transcripts ($24,456), and building costs ($17,217).\nFour individuals have so far been charged in the investigation. Two people connected to the Trump campaign – former national security adviser Michael Flynn and former campaign aide George Papadopoulos – have pleaded guilty to perjury and are cooperating.\nTwo others – Paul Manafort and Rick Gates – have been indicted and pleaded not guilty on money laundering and other charges.\nThat’s about $800,000 per indictment.\nIt is not clear how much the White House has spent on the president’s frequent weekend getaways, but estimates range from about $1m to $3m per weekend.\n",

        "text": "\nBritain’s high street banks processed nearly $740m from a vast money-laundering operation run by Russian criminals with links to the Russian government and the KGB, the Guardian can reveal.\nHSBC, the Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds, Barclays and Coutts are among 17 banks based in the UK, or with branches here, that are facing questions over what they knew about the international scheme and why they did not turn away suspicious money transfers.\n\n\n\n\nThe Global Laundromat: how did it work and who benefited?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDocuments seen by the Guardian show that at least $20bn appears to have been moved out of Russia during a four-year period between 2010 and 2014. The true figure could be $80bn, detectives believe.\nOne senior figure involved in the inquiry said the money from Russia was “obviously either stolen or with criminal origin”.\nInvestigators are still trying to identify some of the wealthy and politically influential Russians behind the operation, known as “the Global Laundromat”.\nThey estimate a group of about 500 people were involved. These include oligarchs, Moscow bankers, and figures working for or connected to the FSB, the successor spy agency to the KGB. \nIgor Putin, the cousin of Russia’s president, Vladimir, sat on the board of a Moscow bank which held accounts involved in the fraud.\nBritish-registered companies played a prominent role in this extensive money-laundering network. The real owners of most of the firms used in the scheme remain secret, however, because of the anonymity provided by controversial offshore laws.\nThe Global Laundromat banking records were obtained by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) and Novaya Gazeta from sources who wish to remain anonymous. OCCRP shared the data with the Guardian and media partners in 32 countries.\nThe documents include details of about 70,000 banking transactions, including 1,920 that went through UK banks and 373 via US banks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  HSBC’s building in Canary Wharf, London. Photograph: Anthony Devlin/PA Archive/Press Association Ima\n\n\nThe data is understood to be part of the evidence gathered in a three-year money-laundering investigation led by police in Latvia and Moldova.\nDetectives have unravelled a conspiracy that involved billions of dollars being sent from suspected criminals in Russia via accounts in Latvia and Moldova held at banks notorious for their exposure to money-laundering scams.\n\n\n\n\nRussian money and the 'Global Laundromat': what UK banks said\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe trail led investigators to 96 countries and to a network of anonymously owned firms, most of them registered at Companies House in London. Most of the 21 core companies under scrutiny have been dissolved.\nThe scale of the operation has staggered law enforcement officials. The records show British banks and foreign banks with offices in London processed $738.1m in transactions apparently involving criminal money from Moscow.\nBanks say they have sophisticated units dedicated to rooting out financial crime. But they say the volume of payments – billions a year – makes such work difficult. \n“If you are on the back end you are kind of playing whack-a-mole, trying to pick this up,” one source said.\nHSBC processed $545.3m in Laundromat cash, mostly routed through its Hong Kong branch. The troubled Royal Bank of Scotland – which is 71% owned by the UK government – handled $113.1m. Coutts – used by the Queen and owned by RBS – accepted $32.8m worth of payments via its office in Zurich, Switzerland. Coutts is winding down its Swiss operation and was last month fined by regulators for money laundering in a different case.\nOther high street banks that appear in the Laundromat data include Barclays, NatWest and Lloyds. NatWest – also owned by RBS – allowed through $1.1m.\n\nBritish banks\n\nIn the US, big banks processed more than $63.7m. They include Citibank ($37m) and Bank of America ($14m).\nThe Guardian contacted all these banks. None of them challenged the authenticity of the data, but they all insisted they had strict anti-money-laundering policies.\nThe response from RBS was typical. The bank said: “We are committed to combatting financial crime and money laundering in line with our regulations and have controls and safeguards in place to identify, assess, monitor and mitigate these risks.” The statement covered Coutts and NatWest.\nHSBC said: “This case highlights the need for greater information sharing between the public and private sectors, each of whom holds important information the other does not.”\nHowever, the Guardian’s disclosures raise awkward questions for UK banks. The Financial Conduct Authority demands that banks “consider the money-laundering risk presented by customers, taking into account country risk; the customer’s reputation and the source of their wealth and funds”.\nIn many of the cases looked at by the Guardian, money vanished into offshore shell firms, whose “beneficial owners” remain anonymous, and whose source of wealth is a mystery. The OCCRP discovered that the official owners of many of the firms were fake or “nominee” directors based in Ukraine.\n\n\n\n\nHow 'dirty money' from Russia flooded into the UK – and where it went\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Guardian showed details of the transfers to L Burke Files, an international financial investigator. He said compliance checks at many western banks were desultory, and often little more than “box ticking”.\n“Typically the compliance and investigations department is treated like an unwanted step-child. The directors of a bank see compliance as an expense without any return. The compliance professionals are underpaid, underskilled and receive little or no effective training in spotting criminal patterns.”\nFiles added: “Most of the transactions I’m seeing here would have required substantial enhanced due diligence. It isn’t just individual transactions. It’s the repeated pattern.”\nPolice in eastern Europe have focused on a number of British shell companies, including Seabon Limited, which was run by a company management firm in Tooley Street, London, just around the corner from the mayor of London’s office and City Hall.\nIn 2013, Seabon filed accounts to Companies House saying its income was just £1. The firm was wound up in February 2016. According to an analysis of the records, Seabon was involved in transactions worth $9bn. Another firm – Ronida Invest LLP, registered in Newhall Street, Birmingham – processed $6.4bn.\nProsecutors in eastern Europe claim both firms were set up for the purposes of fraud.\nThe records also give an insight into Russian shopping habits, although the customers in many cases are unknown. They bought diamonds from a jewellers in Bond Street, furs from brokers in north London, and chandeliers from a Chelsea boutique.\nThe scheme was also used for a wealthy Russian to pay for his son’s boarding fees at Millfield, a prestigious school in Somerset.\nOften, the information in the notes section of wire transfers was misleading. One bank payment of $500,000 was marked down in records as “notebooks”. Actually, it was spent on fur.\n\n\n\n\nA thousand miles from Moscow: how Putin forged his Russian heartland | Anne Garrels\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe scheme that allowed the transfer of money from east to west was unravelled by police following the launch of the inquiry in 2014. The OCCRP – which first reported the story – originally called it “the Russian Laundromat”.\nTypically, two firms would pretend to lend money to one another, with the sums underwritten by Russian businesses. One company would then “default” on the loan. Judges would certify the “debt” as authentic, allowing the Russian businesses to send cash to an account in Moldova. From there it went to Latvia, inside the EU.\nAccounts held at 19 Russian banks were involved in the scheme. In 2014, it was reported that one financial institution was the Russian Land Bank (RZB). A bank board member at the time was Igor Putin.\nDetectives say accounts at RZB transferred about $9.7bn to accounts at Moldova’s Moldindconbank. The cash was then moved to Trasta Komercbanka in Riga.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  A view of Riga. Photograph: Alamy\n\n\nRZB’s director Alexander Grigoriev was arrested in Moscow in 2015, a year after his bank was shut down for money-laundering offences. \nSources told the OCCRP that Grigoriev had links to the FSB, Russia’s main spy agency.\nHe has denied wrongdoing and says he is a respectable citizen. He remains in custody, accused of stealing assets in a different case.\nIgor Putin declined to comment. In a letter written in 2014, he said: “My personal experience, gained in recent years, proves the truth of the thesis that the Russian banking system should be radically rehabilitated and cleaned of troubled banks headed by people with doubtful reputations.”\n\n\n\n\nContact the Guardian securely\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrasta, the Latvian bank at the centre of the scandal, was closed in 2016. Maija Treija, deputy director of Latvia’s finance ministry, said it lost its licence due to money laundering. Of the billions sent from Russia, she said: “Obviously it was money either stolen or with criminal origin.” The fight against money laundering was a “never-ending story”, she told the Finnish broadcaster YLE.\nThe involvement of Moldova’s banks in the scandal led to a political crisis that has seen five prime ministers come and go in the last two years.\nFormer and current officials working at Moldova’s central bank were detained by prosecutors last August suspected of turning a blind eye to information on money laundering carried out through Moldindconbank.\nThe fraud has also sparked a row with Moscow. This month, Moldova’s parliament said Russia’s FSB had “abusively treated” Moldovan officials arriving in the Russian Federation. It linked their harassment to Moldova’s Laundromat investigation and said some of the money had been used to try to bribe Moldovan MPs.\nThe FSB – run by Vladimir Putin before he became prime minister and president – had used part of the Laundromat money to further Russian state interests, Moldovan officials said.\n\nGot a story?

This spring, I sat down in Moscow with an astute former staffer of the presidential administration and he remarked that Putin demanded apparent success today at the expense of real success tomorrow. Brexit may prove the perfect case study.\n\n\n\n\nThe secret Brexit files contain our future – they must be released | Abi Wilkinson\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis should not be a great surprise. To portray Putin as the masterful geopolitical chess-player has become a familiar cliche. But in recent years, Putin seems to have become increasingly insulated from bad news and critical opinions, and has made serious mistakes as a result. In particular, he and his cronies time and again have shown themselves unable to understand democratic societies, and the resilience that lies beneath the surface of fractiousness and short-termism.\nIf Putin ever deluded himself that his campaign of hacks, disinformation, covert political donations and other gambits was going to allow him to shape the western political agenda, he ought now to be having second thoughts. Admittedly Russian meddling has managed to worsen existing political and social tensions throughout the west, from playing to an Islamophobic nativism in Europe, to the populist resentments that fuelled the Trump campaign.\nYet to what real advantage? Nato has regained its focus on the challenge from the east and is now spending more on defence. Key European leaders such as Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel are unequivocal about Moscow being a dangerous influence. Investigations, rumours and court cases are boxing in Donald Trump. Even the Brexit vote, which undoubtedly delighted a Kremlin eager to see Europe divided and discordant, now looks open to question.\nAll told, it would be a fitting irony if, of all people, it was Putin who saved Britain from Brexit. A steady trickle of hard information and soft rumour about Russian support for Brexit risks becoming a torrent. Some of this support was, frankly, of questionable impact. Too much is often made of the alleged influence of the English-language Sputnik news agency and RT television channel, or even of the online trolling and disinformation campaign. Evidence that they actually changed minds – rather than just pandered to existing prejudices – is still lacking.\nHowever, there is a growing likelihood that later this year or early next we will see solid evidence of financial support for the Brexit camp, too. MP Ben Bradshaw has used parliamentary privilege to raise the question of the mysteriously bottomless pockets of Arron Banks, the main backer for Leave.EU. The Electoral Commission this week launched an investigation into whether he and one of his companies broke campaign finance rules in the run-up to the referendum. George Cottrell, once an aide to the former Ukip leader Nigel Farage, has been arrested by the FBI on money laundering charges, and we await the outcome of that investigation.\n\n\n\n\nIs a second Brexit vote possible? Yes – if the people want it | Hugo Dixon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, according to US intelligence sources with whom I have discussed Moscow’s activities, there are other cases of what the Russian spooks call “black cash” supporting pro-Brexit campaigns and campaigners, likely to be revealed over the course of the several inquiries taking place on the other side of the Atlantic. Of course, assessing the impact of these operations will require careful study and scholarly rigour. But when has this stopped anyone using eye-catching allegations for political advantage?\nIronically enough, this may come at exactly the right time to let a British political elite increasingly alarmed about Brexit off the hook. There is public dismay at the slow progress of talks, but no clear mandate to reverse policy. Hard evidence of active, covert Russian interference would delegitimise the original vote, given the narrow margin of victory. Hardcore Brexiteers will risk looking like Putin’s “useful idiots”.\nThis would allow the government to re-run or even disregard the referendum without looking as if it is admitting a mistake or challenging the popular will. It would also smooth the way to allowing article 50 to be revoked or ignored with no penalty. (While the EU is formally committed to allowing the UK to change its mind, there are those in Brussels with more punitive intent.)\nPutin’s self-harming passion for subversion seems to be the toxic product of a KGB background, a nationalist’s anger at the decline of the superpower and a lack of other, more acceptable, ways of advancing Russia’s agenda. As Putin pushes his spies, trolls, diplomats and lobbyists to take every opportunity to divide, distract and disrupt the west, whatever the long-term cost, he risks making his country into a pariah state.\nIt is possible that his active measures helped tip the balance in the Brexit referendum. Even more likely, they will help tip the balance back.\n• Dr Mark Galeotti is a senior researcher at the Institute of International Relations Prague and head of its Centre for European Security\n",

        "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/30/russia-inquiry-charges-trump-manafort-papadopoulos-gates",
        "text": "\nOn the day that Donald Trump summoned James Comey to a one-on-one dinner and asked the then FBI director to pledge loyalty, a crucial interview was taking place at the bureau. George Papadopoulos, a former foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign, was questioned about contacts with a Russia-linked professor who had offered “dirt” on election rival Hillary Clinton.\nPapadopoulos lied during that 27 January encounter, it transpired on Monday. He is the first person to face criminal charges linked to interactions between the Trump campaign and Russia during last year’s presidential election.\n\n\n Quick guide What you need to know about the Trump-Russia inquiry  \n\n\n Show \n\n\n Hide  \n\n\n\nHow serious are the allegations?\n\nThe story of Donald Trump and Russia comes down to this: a sitting president or his campaign is suspected of having coordinated with a foreign country to manipulate a US election. The story could not be bigger, and the stakes for Trump – and the country – could not be higher.\n\n\n\nWhat are the key questions?\n\nInvestigators are asking two basic questions: did Trump’s presidential campaign collude at any level with Russian operatives to sway the 2016 US presidential election? And did Trump or others break the law to throw investigators off the trail?\n\n\n\nWhat does the country think?\n\nWhile a majority of the American public now believes that Russia tried to disrupt the US election, opinions about Trump campaign involvement tend to split along partisan lines: 73% of Republicans, but only 13% of Democrats, believe Trump did “nothing wrong” in his dealings with Russia and its president, Vladimir Putin.\n\n\n\nWhat are the implications for Trump?\n\nThe affair has the potential to eject Trump from office. Experienced legal observers believe that prosecutors are investigating whether Trump committed an obstruction of justice. Both Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton – the only presidents to face impeachment proceedings in the last century – were accused of obstruction of justice. But Trump’s fate is probably up to the voters. Even if strong evidence of wrongdoing by him or his cohort emerged, a Republican congressional majority would probably block any action to remove him from office. (Such an action would be a historical rarity.)\n\n\n\nWhat has happened so far?\n\nFormer foreign policy adviser George Papadopolous pleaded guilty to perjury over his contacts with Russians linked to the Kremlin, and the president’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort and another aide face charges of money laundering.\n\n\n\nWhen will the inquiry come to an end?\n\nThe investigations have an open timeline.\n\n\n\n\n\nWas this helpful?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you for your feedback.\n\n\n\n\nAnd ominously for the White House, the indictment against him states that, following his arrest at Dulles international airport in July, he has “met with the government on numerous occasions to provide information and answer questions” – implying that he has “flipped” and is now assisting special counsel Robert Mueller.\nPreet Bharara, the former US attorney for the southern district of New York, who was fired by Trump, tweeted: “Special Counsel Mueller appears to have a cooperating witness, George Papadopoulos. That is significant. Time will tell how significant.”\nThe revelation came on the day that former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his deputy Rick Gates were also indicted on 12 charges of conspiracy against the US, conspiracy to launder money, failing to register as a foreign agent, making false statements and failure to report offshore bank accounts.\nThese were the first public actions in Mueller’s sprawling investigation into possible collusion between Trump’s campaign and Moscow. Even in the best times for a US president, that would be hugely damaging. For this president, it may be only the beginning.\nTrump made a characteristic attempt to downplay their significance and deflect attention elsewhere. “Sorry, but this is years ago, before Paul Manafort was part of the Trump campaign,” he tweeted. “But why aren’t Crooked Hillary & the Dems the focus?????”\nThree minutes later he added for good measure: “....Also, there is NO COLLUSION!”\nIt is true that Manafort’s indictment makes no mention of Trump or Russian involvement in the election campaign. But they do indicate that he is accused of illegal foreign lobbying on behalf of a Ukrainian political party with a pro-Russian stance from 2005 all the way up to and including 2016.\n\n\n \n\n\nPlay Video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n0:44\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  White House: No sign of collusion in campaign aides' indictments – video\n\n\nThe Center for American Progress Action Fund noted: “The inclusion of money laundering charges indicates something important: leverage. If Manafort’s Kremlin-aligned partners were aware of his money laundering crimes, that would give them leverage over the head of Donald Trump’s campaign.”\nAnd the fact that, with so many skeletons rattling in his cupboard, he was hired to work for Trump suggests that the campaign did not employ the type of “extreme vetting” the president now advocates for immigration to the US. The indictment filed in federal court in Washington accuses Manafort and Gates of funneling tens of millions of dollars in payments through foreign companies and bank accounts.\nManafort – campaign chairman from March to August 2016 – was also among the participants of a June meeting at Trump Tower with a Kremlin-linked lawyer that raised suspicions of coordination between the campaign and Moscow. Gates, for his part, never left the campaign, was on the inaugural committee and has made visits to Trump at the White House.\nThe indictment against Papadopoulos offers the hardest evidence yet tying the Trump campaign to Russian government interference in the election. The administration will probably claim that Papadopoulos, who pleaded guilty earlier this month to making false statements to FBI agents, played a limited role in the campaign and no direct access to Trump, as it has with similarly nebulous figures such as Carter Page.\n\n\n\n\nTrump-Russia inquiry heats up as three key aides indicted\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the indictment, which was unsealed on Monday, is damning. “Papadopoulos impeded the FBI’s investigation into the existence of any links or coordination between individuals associated with the campaign and the Russian government’s efforts to interfere with the 2016 presidential election,” it states.\nThe international energy lawyer initially told investigators that the professor was a “nothing” and “just a guy talk[ing] up connections or something” when in truth he understood that the professor had “substantial connections to Russian government officials,” the document says.\nThe special counsel said Papadopoulos told FBI agents he had been in contact with an unnamed foreign “professor” who claimed to have “dirt” on Democratic nominee Clinton in the form of “thousands of emails”, and that Papadopoulos claimed such contacts occurred before he joined Trump’s campaign. However, Papadopoulos in fact did not meet the professor until after he joined Trump’s campaign, according to the indictment.\nThe Manafort charges were not unexpected after initial reports emerged on Friday night, but the Papadopoulos case may have taken even Trump by surprise. The president spent the weekend typically trying to fling mud in other directions to obscure the picture. On Sunday, he called Mueller’s investigation a “witch hunt” and tweeted about the special counsel’s attention to “phony Trump/Russia, ‘collusion’, which doesn’t exist”.\nFox News and other conservative media are also likely to remain loyal, questioning the significance of the charges and continuing to focus on Clinton instead. And perhaps most reassuringly for Trump, his populist base rarely seems troubled by the issue, cheering at rallies when the president mockingly says that he did not see any Russians in Pennsylvania, West Virginia or other states.\nNevertheless, the odds on the special counsel’s investigation leading to Trump’s downfall just shortened again. People will talk. Matthew Miller, a former justice department spokesman, tweeted: “Mueller’s choreographed one-two punch today sends a signal to every Trump official: cooperate & get a good deal or resist & get hammered.”\n",

        "text": "\nOne of the most senior prosecutors in Cyprus has allegedly offered private advice and information to Russian officials, raising further questions about attempts by the Kremlin to exert influence over governments of EU countries.\nPrivate emails published over the weekend showed a senior lawyer within the Cyprus law office privately offered assistance to Russian officials in sensitive extradition cases, even when individuals had applied for asylum.\nThe private emails of Eleni Loizidou, who in effect served as deputy attorney general and was once nominated for a seat on the European court of human rights, were published by the Greek Cypriot newspaper Politis. \nAmong the revelations were allegations that Loizidou offered advice and, in some cases, to intervene in proceedings on Russians’ behalf.\nReached by the Guardian, Loizidou staunchly denied wrongdoing and said she was just as “friendly” with Russian counterparts as she was with American and British colleagues.\nShe claimed it was her duty to inform foreign counterparts of information in extradition cases and only selective emails showing her dealings with Russia had been published.\n“It is cooperation and I think I am good at my job,” she said. “I have never received any presents from Russia except the occasional vodka and small chocolates. I have never lived with expensive taste. My salary is only €4,000 a month.”\nIn a 2013 email exchange between Loizidou and Vladimir Zimin, the deputy head of the department of international legal cooperation in the Russian prosecutor general’s office, Loizidou thanked him for “excellent hospitality” during a stay in Moscow and joked that she might require a job offer if advice she privately offered the Russians about asylum cases became public.\nIn another case, Loizidou allegedly offered to intervene in a case so Russian authorities could win a court delay and more time to prepare documents. A different email allegedly showed her offering insights into how a case had been legally mishandled in a way that could help the Russian side.\nCyprus and its links to the Kremlin, particularly in the banking sector, where it has been seen as a hub for money laundering, have long been a source of concern within the EU. \nOn Monday, Costas Clerides, the Cyprus attorney general, announced that he had ordered a disciplinary investigation into the Russia allegations and would transfer Lozidou from the law office’s extraditions department to a separate department. He also called for a police investigation into the apparent theft of her emails, which could be considered a criminal offfence.\nLoizidou told the Guardian she believed she had been the target of an apparent hack of her private emails, saying she had ignored several alerts that her account had been compromised, because of pending cases of wealthy Russians being extradited back to Russia. Loizidou also pointed to recent remarks in which she was critical of Interpol’s decision to deem certain arrest warrants “politically motivated”.\nShe has said such decisions ought to be determined by courts.\nHer stance appeared to be a thinly veiled criticism of Interpol ignoring a request from Russia for the arrest of Bill Browder, the co-founder of Hermitage Capital. He has been accused of fraud in Russia and is a vociferous critic of Vladimir Putin. The Kremlin’s pursuit of Browder is seen in the US and Europe as being politically motivated.\nRussia and Cyprus have been engaged in a diplomatic tussle over an investigation into Browder. The government in Cyprus had been cooperating with Russian prosecutors in their attempts to investigate his financial dealings. But a judge in Cyprus recently intervened and advised the government to delay cooperation until the court ruled on a claim by Browder’s defence team that the action was a politically motivated attack by the Kremlin.\n",

        "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/28/trump-tweets-hoax-louise-mensch-claude-taylor",
        "text": "\nExplosive allegations about Donald Trump made by online writers with large followings among Trump critics were based on bogus information from a hoaxer who falsely claimed to work in law enforcement.\n\n\n\n\nNew fake news dilemma: sites publish real scoops amid mess of false reports\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClaude Taylor tweeted fake details of criminal inquiries into Trump that were invented by a source whose claim to work for the New York attorney general was not checked, according to emails seen by the Guardian. The allegations were endorsed as authentic and retweeted by his co-writer Louise Mensch.\n The source’s false tips included an allegation, which has been aggressively circulated by Mensch and Taylor, that Trump’s inactive fashion model agency is under investigation by New York authorities for possible sex trafficking.\nThe hoaxer, who fed the information to Taylor by email, said she acted out of frustration over the “dissemination of fake news” by Taylor and Mensch. Their false stories about Trump have included a claim that he was already being replaced as president by Senator Orrin Hatch in a process kept secret from the American public.\n“Taylor asked no questions to verify my identity, did no vetting whatsoever, sought no confirmation from a second source – but instead asked leading questions to support his various theories, asking me to verify them,” the source said in an email.\nAfter being approached for comment by the Guardian on Monday, Taylor posted what he described as a “mea culpa” on Twitter. “As a ‘citizen journalist’ I acknowledge my error and do apologize,” he wrote.\nMensch denied using the bogus information and said her allegations about Trump’s model agency came from her own sources. Asked why she had retweeted Taylor’s false posts, Mensch said: “I don’t think anybody can vet anybody else’s sources.”\nThe source falsely claimed to be an official named “Caitlin” in the office of Eric Schneiderman, New York’s attorney general. She shared details of her hoax on the condition of anonymity to avoid retaliation from followers of Taylor and Mensch. The Guardian verified her true identity and confirmed that she is not named Caitlin and does not work for Schneiderman.\nIn his emails, Taylor pushed the source for sensational material. Three days after she first contacted him, Taylor asked her: “Is there anything you have heard that’s really going to shock people? An ‘Oh my god!’ sort of thing?” In another message, Taylor conceded that he may have been “going farther than I should” by posting tweets that exaggerated the false tips she was giving him.\nThousands of people have reposted the false claims tweeted by Taylor, a former staffer in Bill Clinton’s White House. Mensch, a former member of parliament in the UK, retweeted at least 18 posts by Taylor that were based on the hoaxer’s false information, spreading them further afield.\nThe pair describe themselves as co-writers and have cultivated a large fanbase among some critics of Trump, many of whom identify as members of the “resistance” movement eager to see the president removed from office. Taylor has about 200,000 followers on Twitter while Mensch has 267,000 followers.\nClaiming to report things that the mainstream media will not, they have also moved to collect money from readers. Mensch’s website Patribiotics accepts donations “to fund more writers and research”. Taylor has said he will soon establish an online fundraising campaign to protect himself from legal threats. A GoFundMe page created by supporters of Taylor has already raised more than $18,000 in his name.\nTheir reporting has at times entered the mainstream political news agenda. During a television interview earlier this year, Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts repeated unverified information about the inquiries into Trump and Russia that he had gleaned from Mensch’s website. He later withdrew the comment.\nAmy Spitalnick, a spokeswoman for Schneiderman, said in a statement that the incident highlighted the importance of using “legitimate news outlets, which know to verify their sources and their facts”.\nThe bogus source first contacted Taylor by email on 20 July with an email titled “NYAG investigation”. Earlier that day, MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough had quoted approvingly from an online post by Taylor, describing it as “one of the best tweets of the past month”.\nClaiming to be “a fan” of Taylor’s writing who worked in Schneiderman’s organized crime task force (OCTF), the hoaxer told him his reporting on Trump had been “right on the money”. Taylor replied within two hours, pressing her for usable information about “tangible results like indictments”. He asked: “Are there sealed indictments from grand juries that Schneiderman has convened?”\n Later that day, the hoaxer replied that Trump associates were indeed facing prosecution on state charges in New York. “I am aware of at least one preliminary sealed indictment in that case targeting multiple Trump Org principals,” she wrote.\nTaylor posted a lightly edited version of this to Twitter two days later. He quoted a “NYAG Schneiderman source” as having told him: “I am aware of at least one sealed indictment targeting multiple Trump Organization Principals”. The post was retweeted by Mensch. In all it was retweeted and liked 8,800 times.\nIn the same email, the source gave Taylor false details of how multiple inquiries into Trump were under way across Schneiderman’s OCTF and financial crimes bureau. She said that Trump’s modelling agency was under scrutiny. Taylor relayed all this without verification to his almost 200,000 followers in a pair of tweets.\n“There are a number of investigations being coordinated by NYAG Schneiderman office under both the Financial Crimes Bureau and the Organized Crime Task Force. According to my source one of the more intriguing ones is an inverstigation [sic] into the Trump Modeling Agency,” Taylor said.\nAfter being asked by a follower for more information, Taylor claimed to know even more than the hoaxer had told him. “I have few details but apparently the possibility exists that our president has been a sex trafficker,” he said. Mensch then weighed in, reposting this false claim by Taylor and adding a vague allegation of her own that the full story was even worse.\nTaylor and Mensch also repeated an invented claim from the source that former president Bill Clinton knew of criminal wrongdoing by Trump’s model agency and was preparing to testify for the prosecution. Taylor posted another series of tweets making lurid allegations about Trump’s model agency that yet again matched invented claims supplied to him in emails from the hoaxer.\nSince Taylor posted the allegations about Trump’s model agency, Mensch has pushed similar claims and pushed the hashtag “#PIMPOTUS” – a play on “pimp” and the acronym for president of the United States. Citing what she said were her own sources connected to the intelligence community, she published an article expanding on the allegations on 15 August, tagging the post with the label “Eric Schneiderman”. Mensch had claimed to have knowledge of inquiries by Schneiderman’s office before the hoaxer contacted Taylor.\nThe source also falsely specified to Taylor that the state case was “proceeding under the NY version of a RICO statute” – referring to the federal Racketeering Influence and Corrupt Organizations Act – “which is called enterprise corruption.”\nIn another tweet on 22 July, Taylor claimed that “in point of fact” Schneiderman’s office was “using New York’s ‘Enterprise Corruption’ statutes which are that State’s RICO corollary” in its apparent pursuit of Trump and his associates.\nThe following day, claiming to have “more from Schneiderman source”, Taylor posted a series of tweets giving details about the number of people supposedly being targeted by the inquiries. The tweets corresponded directly with more bogus information emailed to Taylor by the hoaxer earlier that day.\n Taylor repeatedly asked the hoaxer whether Rudy Giuliani, the former New York City mayor and an ally of Trump, was implicated. The source replied on 25 July that Giuliani was “currently a subject in the investigation involving money laundering and the Russian mob”.\nA few hours later, Taylor tweeted to claim that he had confirmed Giuliani was “a target of NYAG Trump Organization/money laundering/Russian Organized Crime investigation”. He repeated several other false details provided by the source.\nHow the allegations were based on false information\n---------------------------------------Subject: Re: NYAG investigationTime: July 20, 2017 7:18 PMFrom: CaitlinTo: Claude Taylor---------------------------------------Hello Claude,\n As you probably know, the RICO case that moved to FISC started in our state. I am not privy to what is happening with the federal case but our state court case in proceeding under the NY version of a RICO statute, which is called enterprise corruption. That case is ongoing and being handled by the Financial Crimes Bureau. I am aware of at least one preliminary sealed indictment in that case targeting multiple Trump Org principals. OCTF is not directly involved in that case but is working on a parallel money laundering investigation involving the Russian mafia and principals in the Trump campaign/transition team as well as an investigation of the modeling agency. As you can imagine, there is substantial overlap among the parties and the timeline has been repeatedly adjusted as more targets have come to light. The enterprise corruption case has a head start on our cases but AGS will want to drop them all at the same time so we are likely looking toward the end of the year. \n Yours truly,\n Caitlin\n\n\nClaude Taylor \n(@TrueFactsStated)\nFrom NYAG Schneiderman source, \"I am aware of at least one sealed indictment targeting multiple Trump Organization Principals\".\n\nJuly 22, 2017\n\n\n\n\nLouise Mensch \n(@LouiseMensch)\nSchneiderman is moving https://t.co/sseoG0yKw9\n\nJuly 22, 2017\n\n\n***\n---------------------------------------Subject: Re: TargetsTime: July 23, 2017 9:32 AMFrom: CaitlinTo: Claude Taylor---------------------------------------Hello Mr Taylor,\nThank you for keeping the public informed and for being discreet about my position. I can tell you that OCTF is targeting a total of 78 people right now between the two investigations we have. As you point out, more will likely be added. Currently, it is a combination of Russian mafia and bag men as well as Trump associates and family members. My understanding is the Financial Crimes Bureau currently has around 30-40 targets for the Trump Org-related case. There is overlap among the targets.\nTrump is personally exposed in all three of these investigations, including the money laundering.\nThe issues that may shock the general public, though probably won’t surprise you, have to do with the human trafficking case. Trump Model Management, which recently closed, has ties to Yuri Chaika and his son. We are currently exploring those ties and working with INTERPOL on that aspect of the case. I have to be discreet in how much information I can share at one time so this does not come back to me. But I can tell you now that when this case drops, some VERY high profile names will be involved, some of which are already in talks for immunity deals. I will try to tell you more when I can.Yours truly,\n Caitlin\n\n\nClaude Taylor \n(@TrueFactsStated)\nOn all three. Many Russian nationals are also among the targets as are other Trump family members.\n\nJuly 23, 2017\n\n\n\n\nClaude Taylor \n(@TrueFactsStated)\nI have few details but apparently the possibility exists that our president has been a sex trafficker.

        "text": "\nThe revelations published in the Guardian yesterday about the criminal network that is processing money through major British banks are a damning indictment of the failings of our banking system. For a period of at least four years, shortly after the financial crisis in the early 2010s, Russian criminal interests moved nearly $740m through British banks, including HSBC, RBS, Barclays, Lloyds and Coutts, with HSBC as the largest conduit by far.\nThey could do this, despite regulations expressly designed to prevent such activity taking place. Yet, when presented with a series of urgent questions, demanding answers and action, the response from the government was astonishingly complacent. A mere week after the self-employment tax U-turn, it is following a path well-worn since 2010 – pathetically easy on the big banks and the super-rich, but tough on those just trying to earn a living.\nGeorge Osborne, the then chancellor, intervened directly into a 2012 US investigation into HSBC’s money laundering, emailing the Department of Justice (DoJ) to warn that prosecuting Britain’s largest bank would lead to a “global financial disaster” and “financial calamity”. A later Congressional investigation found that the intervention, by the now new editor of the Evening Standard, “played a significant role in ultimately persuading the DoJ not to prosecute HSBC”.\n\n\n\n\n \n\nHammond said he’d press the reset button on the economy – but he’s stuck to the Osborne-era failed austerity policy\n\n\nIt was under Osborne’s watch that the bank levy, introduced by the last Labour government to claw back some of the astronomical returns major banks had been making, was phased out, in his first budget after the 2015 election. HSBC had previously threatened to leave the country if its £700m bank levy charge wasn’t reduced, lobbying the government heavily. Osborne’s new tax regime for banks, introduced in summer 2015, instead leant most heavily on the smaller banks that had been looking to break the high street dominance of the big banks, and eased the burden substantially on the biggest institutions with major international interests – happily enough, HSBC was the biggest winner of all.\nThe current chancellor, Philip Hammond, although appointing HSBC’s former European chief economist as his economic advisor, had claimed he was going to “press the reset button” on economic policy shortly after arriving in office. It is now clear that he is sticking to the same failed Osborne-era austerity policy, married to the same degree of incompetence in presenting his budgets.\nHe is also showing the same unwillingness to challenge seriously financial practices at our major banks, failing to answer Labour’s urgent question himself and instead sending over an inexcusably poorly briefed and complacent junior minister in his stead.\nThis failure to challenge bad practices extends even to those cases in which the taxpayer is the major shareholder in a bank. The failures of governance, management and in some cases basic morality at taxpayer-owned RBS are legion. The activities of its “global restructuring group” in grinding viable small businesses into the ground so the rest of the bank could pick off the carcasses were under any circumstances wholly unacceptable. But when this is an institution still 72% owned by the public, and when that institution is seemingly so lax as to allow $113m of laundered cash through its doors, it is adding insult to existing injury.\n\n\n\n\nPolice to examine 'Global Laundromat' money laundering allegations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are three assurances the government must now give. First, that it will not – as it has in the past – interfere in any potential criminal investigations on the spurious grounds of “financial stability”. The major risk to financial stability is not from investigations intended to clear out criminal activity from our banking system. The risk is from failing to act and to ensure that our major banks are clean and fit for purpose.\nSecond, all the banks involved claim to have strict internal policies to deal with money laundering, and both the Financial Conduct Authority and the National Crime Agency offer guidance on dealing with suspicious transactions. But yesterday’s revelations make clear that these are not working.\nThe House of Commons Home Affairs Select Committee found last summer that the “suspicious activity reporting” system, by which banks and other financial institutions could report suspicious transactions, was “not fit for purpose”. Designed originally to handle 20,000 reports, it was collapsing under the weight of over 381,000 suspicious activity reports. The select committee demanded the government replace the current system by the end of last year. This has not happened and there is no indication or timetable given in the government’s own reply to the select committee to suggest that it will.\nThird, it is time to cleanse the Augean Stables at RBS. Now that the government has given up attempting to sell its stake in RBS, a new approach must be taken. Having spectacularly missed the opportunity earlier today, the chancellor must now clarify how he will restore public trust and confidence in our financial system.\n",

        "text": "\nThe Turnbull government and Labor have expressed their opposition to a crossbench push for a Senate inquiry into casinos after whistleblowers’ explosive allegations of wrongdoing by Crown Resorts.\nEarlier on Thursday the Greens rounded on Labor, noting its support would be sufficient to set up the inquiry and accusing the opposition of protecting casino bosses. \nOn Wednesday the independent MP Andrew Wilkie and senator Nick Xenophon tabled video evidence in parliament from whistleblowers alleging the Crown casino in Melbourne deliberately tampered with poker machines and avoided money laundering rules.\n\n\n\n\nCrown investigated over pokies tampering at Melbourne casino\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Greens, Xenophon and the independent Jacqui Lambie planned to move a Senate motion for the inquiry late on Thursday morning but postponed it until the next sitting week, starting 13 November, to build pressure on the major parties.\nAsked at a press conference in Canberra about Labor’s position, Bill Shorten said he thought the allegations were “very serious” but police and the gambling regulator in Victoria were “best positioned to deal with state laws”.\nOn Thursday the communications minister, Mitch Fifield, told Radio National that Austrac, the financial intelligence agency, would investigate claims of wrongdoing relating to money laundering.\nBut he said casinos and venue-based poker machines are “matters that fall squarely within the jurisdictions of the states”.\n“There are state regulatory bodies, there are state law enforcement agencies, they have the responsibility in this area,” he said. “They have the power, they have the legislative authority, they are the people who can move swiftly in this area.”\nAt a press conference in Canberra, Wilkie said Labor and the government’s opposition to an inquiry was “scandalous” because “any true leader on hearing yesterday’s allegations would have moved very quickly” to investigate claims of systemic problems.\nEarlier, Xenophon told ABC News Breakfast that the whistleblowers alleged they went to the Victorian regulator and “didn’t get a satisfactory response”.\n“If that is the case, it is appropriate someone else look at the allegations,” he said, calling for the whistleblowers to give evidence under privilege at a Senate inquiry hearing.\nWilkie echoed the point, arguing it was not sufficient for the Victorian gambling regulator to investigate because whistleblowers had accused it of “complicity or incompetence”. Both Wilkie and Xenophon said state governments were “conflicted” because of large revenues from poker machine taxes.\n\n\n\n\nThe poker machine-tampering allegations against Crown in full\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt a doorstop in Canberra, the Greens MP Adam Bandt said the numbers for an inquiry would be there if Labor supported the push.\n“The only thing protecting the casino bosses from a full inquiry into these allegations of misconduct is the Labor party,” he said. “The Labor party now needs to decide whether honesty is more important than money.”\nThe proposed terms of the inquiry are to examine “fraudulent misleading and exploitative practices” in the Australian casino industry, including the integrity of gambling systems, transparency and whistleblower protections, whether fit and proper persons are providing gambling services, national security, consumer harm and whether casinos contribute a net economic benefit.\nCrown is well-connected to both sides of politics, having hired the former Labor national secretary Karl Bitar as a lobbyist in 2011 and with the former communications minister Helen Coonan sitting on its board.\nIn 2015-16 Crown donated more than $60,000 to the Labor party, including $11,000 to the Victorian branch. Crown also donated $108,306 to the Liberal party nationally, including $30,360 to its Victorian division.\nAt a press conference the Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, said it was “remarkable” that Labor and the Coalition had opposed an inquiry and attributed it “to the big donations they get from the gambling industry”.\n“Today the gambling industry hit the jackpot, it’s payday, they’ve managed to call in those massive donations ... that’s why we’ve seen no response from the government.”\n\n\nRichard Di Natale \n(@RichardDiNatale)\n#Crown has given over $1,000,000 to LNP & ALP in the last 10yrs. It’s time to lift the lid #democracy4sale #auspol #springst\n\nOctober 18, 2017\n\n\nAsked whether the public could have full confidence that Labor and the government would be tough on Crown, given the extent of their influence and donations, Shorten said it was “a ridiculous statement”.\n“This is not a question about investigating the allegations. It’s a question who is best placed to investigate them,” he said. “You don’t send the Senate to do a job that the police have got to do or that the state regulator’s got to do.”\nIn a statement to the ASX on Thursday, Crown Resorts Ltd rejected the allegations made by Wilkie concerning the improper manipulation of poker machines and other illegal or improper conduct at Melbourne’ Crown casino.\n“Crown calls on Mr Wilkie to immediately provide to the relevant authorities all information relating to the matters alleged,” it said.\n",

        "text": "\nWhatever route the government chooses for Brexit it will need to cooperate with other countries, especially our EU neighbours, to combat tax avoidance, tax evasion and money laundering. Yet the signs are not very good as the government seems to have chosen non-cooperation. It has snubbed the EU inquiry into the Panama Papers.\n\n\n\n\nPanama Papers: European parliament opens inquiry\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast year, a leak of 11.5m documents and 2.6 terabytes of information from the office of Mossack Fonseca, a Panamanian law firm, drew attention to the possible involvement of UK-based companies, accountants, lawyers, bankers and others in alleged organised tax avoidance and money laundering. The leaked documents, known as the Panama Papers, showed that some 1,924 UK-based banks, accountants, lawyers and other intermediaries helped to set up opaque corporate structures that processed illicit financial flows.\nSecretive British crown dependencies and overseas territories act as an outpost of the City of London and facilitate the flow of money. More than 113,000 of the suspect companies were incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, 15,000 in the Bahamas and a number were also registered in Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man. Suspicious cash is thought to have flooded into the London property market. In April 2016, the UK government claimed that a special task force was investigating the leak.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Treasury minister Jane Ellison failed to appear before the PANA committee. Photograph: Lucy Young/REX\n\n\nFollowing the leak, the EU parliament formed a committee of inquiry into money laundering, tax avoidance and tax evasion, known as the PANA committee, to investigate the issues and develop reforms. After months of discussions, it visited London on 9-10 February to take evidence from academics, researchers, accountants, lawyers, banks, HSBC, parliamentary committees, regulators and ministers. I was one of the individuals who gave evidence on 9 February. On 10 February, the committee was due to meet officials from HM Treasury and Her Majesty’s Revenue & Customs (HMRC) to learn about the state of its investigations. At the last minute, HM Treasury sent a short email and pulled out of the meeting. Despite prior discussions, it failed to send any minister or senior civil servant to discuss anything with the PANA committee. The HMRC representative was unable to engage fully with the committee.\nPerhaps the Treasury’s snub sends a signal about how the UK will cooperate, or otherwise, with the EU after Brexit. It is quite likely that treasury ministers Jane Ellison and/or David Gauke did not show up because they would have been unable to defend the UK’s ineffective regulatory response.\nThe UK has a poor record. Previously, inside information provided by HSBC whistleblower Hervé Daniel Marcel Falciani to HMRC showed that the bank’s Swiss branch may have helped wealthy people to evade taxes. Only one individual from the Falciani list of some 3,600 potential UK tax evaders has been prosecuted. In January 2016, HMRC told the Public Accounts Committee that it had abandoned its criminal investigation. By HMRC’s own admission, there have been only 13 offshore-specific prosecutions since 2009 as it puts more emphasis on making secretive deals than sending a message of zero tolerance. Matters are not helped by the fact that the government has systematically hollowed out HMRC.\nDeal making and private manipulations are deeply ingrained in the British system. In the US, HSBC was fined $1.9bn. The charge sheet issued by the US Department of Justice said that the bank’s failures permitted “narcotics traffickers and others to launder hundreds of millions of dollars through HSBC subsidiaries, and to facilitate hundreds of millions more in transactions with sanctioned countries”. Later on, it emerged that then UK chancellor George Osborne and banking regulators were urging the US regulators to go easy and not to prosecute HSBC.\nThe UK cannot succeed in combating illicit financial flows because it has poor regulatory structures. There are more than 20 regulators dealing with tax avoidance and money laundering and no one adequately coordinates them, scrutinises them or calls them to account for their silence. The regulatory patchwork includes HM Treasury, HMRC, the Financial Conduct Authority, National Crime Agency, Serious Fraud Office, Ministry of Justice, Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy, the Insolvency Service, various professional bodies representing accountants, lawyers, insolvency practitioners and estate agents, to mention just a few.\n\n\n\n\nDo we really want post-Brexit Britain to be the world’s biggest tax haven? | Molly Scott Cato\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Panama Papers, HSBC and other episodes draw attention to the role of accountants, lawyers and other enablers in facilitating tax evasion and money laundering, but the professional bodies representing them routinely lobby to water down laws and enforcement. The same bodies are then expected to investigate and prosecute their own members. None owes a duty of care to the public, nor is obliged to reveal the evidence examined by them. The result is all too predictable. On many occasions, judges have declared avoidance schemes developed by accountants to be unlawful but, to this day, not even one accountancy firm has been investigated, prosecuted or fined.\nThe UK government’s snub of the EU parliamentary committee is foolish and short-sighted. It is hardly a way of making friends for the tough post-Brexit journey ahead. In a globalised economy, no country on its own can combat illicit financial flows, and the UK stands to lose more than most because London’s reputation for dirty business will deter honest businesses. It will erode the country’s tax base and anger people who pay their taxes only to discover that the government is not living up to its promise of tackling organised tax avoidance/evasion and money laundering.\n",

        "text": "\nHSBC is offering its employees cash bonuses of up to £2,500 if they can convince a colleague to move from London to the bank’s new British headquarters in Birmingham.\nThe bank has created a special bonus scheme to encourage staff to “help us find the right people for Birmingham” because it is struggling to entice enough of its staff to make the 120-mile move before its new office opens in January. \nStaff who manage to convince a friend to make the move to Birmingham will be rewarded with a cash bonus of between £750 and £2,500 depending on the seniority of the new Midlands recruit. \nBritain’s biggest bank has only convinced just over half of its target of 1,040 people to make the move more than two years after announcing it would switch its UK banking operations from Canary Wharf to Birmingham. \nThe new cash bonus comes on top of the bank already attempting to sweeten the change by making its standard relocation package “more attractive” with “support for housing and children’s schooling”. \nAntónio Simões, HSBC’s chief executive, told reporters last week, during a visit to the bank’s new 10-storey 210,000-sq-ft office building in Centenary Square: “We have had some challenges but today we are ahead of where we thought we would be, with around 53% of the roles filled.”\nSimões, who took over as HSBC’s chief executive in 2015, said it had proven “trickier” than expected to convince some specialists, particularly in areas like marketing and communications, to make the move, which he described as “quite a big task still”.\n“We’ve made the standard package more attractive by offering for example support for housing and children’s schooling,” Simões said. He did not mention the cash bonuses, which were later found to be offered on HSBC internal staff website.\nA HSBC spokesman said that despite the difficulties in convincing staff to move, the bank was convinced that its new £200m office would open on schedule. \nThe reluctance of the bank’s staff to move to the Midlands comes despite much lower house prices and a cheaper cost of living in Birmingham compared with London.\nAccording to the property prices index provided by Hometrack the average home in Birmingham costs £152,000, less than a third of the average price in London. But house prices in Birmingham are rising much faster than in the capital, with prices up 7.7% in the year to April compared to 3.5% in London. \n The new Birmingham office will contain HSBC’s UK retail and commercial bank, which is being split from the riskier parts of the group under the government’s ringfencing rules, which come into force at the start of 2019.\nThe continuing difficulty in recruiting staff for the Birmingham office may concern the bank’s official monitor, who was last year reported to have described the move as “a programme in crisis”. Michael Cherkasky, a lawyer who was installed as the bank’s official monitor following HSBC’s £1.2bn fine for money laundering offences from the US in 2012, was said to have expressed concerns to executives about the lack of staff willing to make the move. He said a delay could lead to the bank’s UK division lacking the ability to maintain proper money-laundering controls.\nHSBC, which has 16 million customers in the UK, selected Birmingham for its British headquarters partly because of its purchase of Midland Bank in 1992. About 48,000 of HSBC’s 257,000 staff work in Britain.\nMany British banks and other businesses are trying to relocate parts of their operations out of London because of the rising cost of office space in the capital. Of the 2.2 million people employed in financial services jobs in the UK, two-thirds now work outside London, according to data from the industry lobby group TheCityUK.\nFinancial jobs in Birmingham rose by 6.9% between 2013 and 2015, the group said. Other large financial employers in the city include Deutsche Bank, which has increased its Birmingham staff from 35 in 2007 to about 1,500 today.\n",

Among those detained was a 32-year-old detective constable from the Met intelligence unit, who was arrested at a home in London on suspicion of money laundering, fraud by false representation, perverting the course of justice and offences under the Computer Misuse Act.\nThe second officer detained was a police constable, aged 22. He was arrested in Essex on suspicion of fraud by false representation, police said.\nThe investigation is being conducted by anti-corruption officers from the Met’s directorate of professional standards and the police watchdog, the Independent Police Complaints Commission has been informed.\nDCI Sharon Brooks, who is leading the investigation, said: “Acting on intelligence, we have carried out an operation that has resulted in nine arrests, including two serving police officers.\n“We are committed to dealing with all corruption in the Met, and that includes those who seek to corrupt our staff.”\nThe seven other arrested include six men aged 22 to 46 who were arrested at addresses in London and Essex. They were arrested on suspicion of offences including money laundering, perverting the course of justice and fraud by false representation.\nA 38-year-old woman was arrested in Barnet, north London, for alleged money laundering.\nPolice said all were taken to central London police stations for questioning and that the status of the arrested police officers was being reviewed, a reference to whether the two officers will be suspended from duty or allowed to keep working while inquiries continue.\n",

        "text": "\nGermany’s biggest bank is coming under pressure from a US senator to give further details of its lending to Donald Trump and meetings it has had with the administration.\nChris Van Hollen has written to Deutsche Bank asking for assurances that it will not use the president’s outstanding multimillion-dollar loans as “leverage”. The Democratic senator is also demanding to know whether the bank has restructured Trump’s debt or sold it to “foreign entities”.\nTrump currently has two loans and two mortgages with Deutsche Bank and owes it about $340m (£270m). The bank has also extended another $950m to a venture in which Trump owns a 30% stake, the Wall Street Journal reported in January.\nVan Hollen, who sits on the Senate banking committee, said he had “great concern” about possible conflicts of interest between Deutsche and Trump and questions about whether the bank’s role as the president’s largest creditor could influence multiple ongoing investigations into the German bank.\nIn a letter to Bill Woodley, the CEO of Deutsche Bank America, the senator wrote: “I am asking that you do not use your institution’s ties to President Trump as leverage in any of these ongoing cases or ongoing regulatory oversight.\n“Further, I ask that Deutsche Bank and its executives do not take any actions to assist Mr Trump in circumventing any of his ethical obligations to avoid conflicts of interest.”\nDeutsche Bank says its position is that it will not comment or guide on any stories about Trump’s financial affairs.\nThe letter, sent on Wednesday and obtained by the Guardian, comes as Deutsche Bank faces ongoing investigations by the Department of Justice into alleged money laundering involving Russia. It is also in settlement talks with federal officials over its alleged role in the mortgage crisis. \nVan Hollen and another prominent Democrat, Congresswoman Maxine Waters, have raised concerns about whether Jeff Sessions, the US attorney general, could oversee an impartial investigation given the bank’s close ties to the White House. Van Hollen said Sessions had not responded to an earlier letter about his oversight of the Deutsche probes at the DoJ, but Van Hollen’s position on the banking committee means the German bank could feel compelled to reply. \nIn recent months Deutsche Bank’s alleged links with Russia have come under intense scrutiny. The FBI, meanwhile, has announced that it is investigating possible collusion in the run-up to the US election between officials from the Trump campaign and the Kremlin. \nIn January the New York Department of Financial Services (DFS) fined the bank $425m for failing to prevent $10bn of Russian money laundering. The “mirror trades” scheme was run out of its Moscow office. The UK’s Financial Conduct Authority imposed a £163m fine – its biggest ever – for the same offence. \nThe previous month Deutsche paid $7.2bn to settle a decade-old toxic bond mis-selling scandal with the US Department of Justice.\nIn March it emerged Deutsche played a prominent role in a second Russian money-laundering scandal. It was one of dozens of western financial institutions that processed at least $20bn – and possibly more – of criminal Russian cash. The scheme, “the Global Laundromat”, ran from 2010 to 2014.\n\n\n\n\nThe Global Laundromat: how did it work and who benefited?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Guardian revealed in February that some of Trump’s immediate family members were clients of Deutsche, including the president’s daughter Ivanka, her husband, Jared Kushner, and Kushner’s mother, Seryl Stadtmauer. \nIn his letter Van Hollen said Kushner, the president’s trusted senior advisor, had a multimillion-dollar line of credit with the bank. Deutsche has provided $370m in financing for a Kushner Companies’ property in Time Square. \nDeutsche has conducted a close internal examination of the US president’s personal account to gauge whether there are any suspicious connections to Russia. It was looking for evidence of whether loans to Trump, which were agreed in highly unusual circumstances, may have been underpinned by financial guarantees from Moscow. Sources inside Deutsche said no link was found.\nBut in his letter to Woodley, Van Hollen said he wanted more information about this internal review, triggered when Trump won the Republican nomination for president. The senator asked for a description of the bank’s “risk management” and whether any irregularities emerged during the internal inquiry.\nVan Hollen is also seeking reassurances that the president and his family are not receiving preferential treatment in a way that would violate federal ethics laws, and further explanation of efforts to restructure Trump’s debt, including whether any had been sold to foreign entities.\n",

        "text": "\nA US government request to trawl through the personal data of millions of users of the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase signals the start of an effort to pull digital currencies like bitcoin into the mainstream, experts have said.\nThe “John Doe” summons, a broad order for data on all Coinbase users in 2013, 2014 and 2015, was filed by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in a federal court in California on 17 November.\nIn the summons, the IRS said that all of Coinbase’s users in that period “have not been or may not be complying with US internal revenue laws”.\nCoinbase has said it will fight the request in court.\n\n\n\n\nCity banks plan to hoard bitcoins to help them pay cyber ransoms\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCryptocurrencies – digital assets which exist entirely online but are exchangeable for goods or services – have grown in popularity in recent years, in part because they grant a degree of user anonymity. Coinbase is the largest bitcoin exchange and its best-known brand.\nBut user confidentiality has also caused headaches for governments, who worry the currencies are being used for drug dealing, money laundering or tax evasion. Digital currencies are currently taxed as an asset like gold, with capital gains tax due when there is an appreciation in value.\nHowever, the extent to which bitcoin users with US tax liabilities have been declaring such assets is unclear. \nIn documentation supporting its petition, the IRS referred to three anonymous cases of taxpayers who had used virtual currencies to evade tax, two of which were “corporate entities with annual revenues of several million dollars” which used Coinbase wallets and concealed bitcoin transactions as “technology expenses” on their tax returns.\nSeveral experts in cryptocurrency said that the IRS was on a “fishing expedition”, and pointed out that it followed an excoriating report by the US treasury’s inspector-general for taxation which said the IRS was not doing enough to regulate and investigate cryptocurrencies.\n“The government has no idea that anybody has committed a crime,” said Jerry Brito, the executive director of Coin Center, a lobbying and research group focused on cryptocurrencies.\nIn a statement, Coinbase said: “Although Coinbase’s general practice is to cooperate with properly targeted law enforcement inquiries, we are extremely concerned with the indiscriminate breadth of the government’s request.”\nIt added: “In its current form, we will oppose the government’s petition in court.”\nSome experts, though dismayed by what they saw as the overly broad and invasive nature of the request, said that more government scrutiny on cryptocurrencies was inevitable as they became more mainstream. \n“It’s an indication of bitcoin’s growing adoption,” said Chris Burniske, an analyst at ARK Investment Management who focuses on bitcoin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  A Bitcoin sign at a pub in Sydney, Australia. Cryptocurrencies have grown in popularity in recent years. Photograph: David Gray / Reuters/Reuters\n\n\n“As more people use it, it is going to grow in a way which affects national and global economies, so the IRS needs more clarity on how citizens are using it,” he said. “Globally, we’re seeing regulators grapple with how to regulate and tax [cryptocurrencies].”\n\n\n\n\nSimon Denny: the artist explaining blockchain with Pokémon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Others said that while they felt Coinbase was right to seek to narrow the scope of the request, some change was needed to bring bitcoin and its ilk out of the dark and into the world of mainstream finance. \n“If bitcoin and other digital currencies are going to be viewed as legitimate financial instruments, there has to be some regulatory apparatus here,” said Kevin McIntyre, associate professor of economics at McDaniel College in Maryland.\n“Certainly,” he added, “the tinfoil hat-wearing libertarian types who embrace the privacy of [bitcoin] are going to be very disappointed.”\nNot all of them, however. Juan Llanos, an advisor in financial technology regulation and compliance, said he was seeing a lot of anger within the cryptocurrency industry at the IRS’s move, but also some schadenfreude from the more anarchistic parts of bitcoin’s user base. \n“Coinbase has been attacked by ultra-anarchists from the beginning, because they are the closest to a digital bank there is,” he said. “Many anarchists – usually the early adopters of bitcoin – who are against the customs of Coinbase are celebrating,” he said.\nThis is not the first time the IRS has used blanket John Doe summonses as part of an investigation, though it is possible that the Coinbase request will be the largest of its kind.\nIn 2014, a federal judge approved similar summonses for FedEx, DHL and UPS to produce information about taxpayers who use an offshore asset-management service called Sovereign Management & Legal, and in 2015 a judge approved another summons for US taxpayers with offshore accounts at Belize Bank International Limited.\n",

        "text": "\nThe most prominent Democratic lobbyist in Washington, whose brother served as campaign chairman to Hillary Clinton, has stepped down from the firm he created after being ensnared by the Russia-Trump investigation led by Robert Mueller.\nTony Podesta, who has donated millions of dollars to the Democratic party and lawmakers on Capitol Hill and worked as a link between corporate America and the Democratic establishment, has reportedly stepped down from his lobbying firm after it emerged that the US special counsel was investigating his work for a Ukrainian not-for-profit group linked to Paul Manafort.\nPodesta’s brother, John Podesta, served as Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman and was a victim in the hacking attack against the Democratic candidate’s campaign. \nAmong hundreds of emails that were hacked from the Clinton campaign and later released by WikiLeaks – a crime that lies at the heart of the Russia investigation – were emails sent by John Podesta. One email from the known foodie included a detailed description of his secret to a good, creamy risotto.\n\n\n\n\nManafort's 'lavish lifestyle' laundered illicit cash through property loans – and Airbnb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews of Tony Podesta’s resignation, which was first reported by Politico, was revealed on the same day that Manafort, Trump’s former campaign chairman, and his associate Rick Gates, were charged in a multi-count indictment alleging conspiracy against the US and money laundering. A third official, a campaign adviser named George Papadopoulos, pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI and is cooperating with investigators.\nPodesta has not been charged with a crime. He declined to comment to the Guardian after being reached on his mobile phone.\nThe Democratic lobbyist’s departure may come as a blow to some Democrats on Capitol Hill, but it also demonstrates the far reach of Mueller’s investigation.\nAny potential charges against Podesta, who reportedly told staff that he did not intend to “go quietly”, could make it harder for Republicans to accuse Mueller of politicising the Trump investigation by only targeting Republicans.\nBut Podesta’s decision to step down, and any potential legal issues in his future, will be embarrassing to Democrats. Podesta is known for his art collection: he and his former wife, Heather, owned Shepard Fairey’s famous “Hope” portrait of Barack Obama, which they donated to the National Portrait Gallery.\nNBC News reported last week that Podesta, who served as an aide to the late Senator Ted Kennedy before opening a lobbying firm in 1988, was being investigated for possibly violating US rules that force lobbyists to disclose work for foreign governments.\nMueller was investigating one of Manafort’s campaigns, the European Centre for a Modern Ukraine, and Podesta’s firm, the Podesta Group, was one of the companies that worked for Manafort, allegedly to improve Ukraine’s image. \nMueller’s investigation is broadly examining claims that the Trump campaign may have colluded with Russia in the 2016 election, but the investigation into Podesta reportedly focuses on whether or not Podesta properly alerted authorities to his work for the Ukraine group.\n\nThis article was amended on 30 October. An earlier version misstated the surname of one of Manafort’s associates. He is Rick Gates, not Davis.\n\n",

        "text": "\nA woman suspected of being a ringleader of a criminal network involved in trafficking young women from Nigeria to Europe for sexual exploitation has been charged with modern slavery offences.\nJosephine Iyamu, 50, a British national, was arrested after she landed at Heathrow on a flight from Lagos, Nigeria, on 24 August, the National Crime Agency (NCA) said. \nIyamu, from Bermondsey in London, was charged with arranging to facilitate travel of another person with a view to exploitation – an offence under the Modern Slavery Act – and was remanded in custody. She will appear at Birmingham crown court on 22 September. \nSenior investigating officer Kay Mellor said: “Criminals involved in modern slavery see their victims as a commodity that can generate income over and over again. They are adept at hiding their activity and often exploit individuals who are vulnerable and may not be missed.“The NCA, with our partners, is turning over stones, seeking out the individuals who are profiting from this trade, prosecuting them and safeguarding the vulnerable people they exploit.”\nA 59-year-old man was also arrested on suspicion of money laundering. He was released and remains under investigation. \nLast month, the NCA said modern slavery and human trafficking was far more prevalent than law enforcement previously thought with potentially tens of thousands of victims in the UK.\nWill Kerr, the NCA’s director of vulnerabilities, said the figures were far higher than those identified by the system set up by the government to identify victims of trafficking, which stood at about 3,800 in 2016.\n“It’s likely in the tens of thousands,” Kerr said. “The more we look for modern slavery the more we find evidence of the widespread abuse of the vulnerable. The growing body of evidence we are collecting points to the scale being far larger than anyone had previously thought.”\n",

        "text": "\nThe outgoing chairman of Britain’s biggest bank, HSBC, has called for an overhaul of financial crime detection as he sounded the alarm over the impact of Brexit and attempts to fragment global financial regulation.\nDouglas Flint’s warning came as HSBC reported a 5% rise in first half profits to $10.2bn (£7.8bn) and announced a $2bn share buy-back – propelling the shares to a four year high.\nFlint, who has been at HSBC for 22 years and chairman for the last six, used his last statement at the bank to call for the rules designed since the financial crisis to be implemented globally. He also warned on the impact of Brexit on Europe’s financial markets.\nAs the bank admitted for the first time that reorganising its business for Brexit will cost up to $300m (£228m), Flint said: “The essential questions that have to be addressed are whether, at the conclusion of the negotiations, the economies of Europe will continue to have access to at least the same amount of financing capacity and related risk management services, and as readily available and similarly priced, as they have enjoyed with the UK as part of the EU.”\nHe also warned that divergence in regulation ran the risk of “skewing” financial market activity to where the rules were less onerous, and he called for more cooperation among regulators to root out “bad actors”. \n“What is … clear is that greater cooperation between the public and private sectors, together with a refresh of bank secrecy laws and regulation designed for a different age, would significantly increase the effectiveness of our joint efforts,” Flint said. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Douglas Flint Group Chairman of HSBC Holdings. Photograph: Jill Mead for the Guardian\n\n\nAmong the ideas he endorsed was a mandatory register of beneficial ownership of corporate structures in every country.\nThe City is focused on HSBC’s attempts to clean up its business after a series of scandals about the tax avoidance strategies used by its Swiss arm and the £1.2bn fine from the US Department of Justice (DoJ) for money laundering, which led to a monitor being installed at the bank as part of a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA).\nUS lawyer Michael Cherkasky was appointed as the monitor five years ago and his concerns have prompted an investigation by the Financial Conduct Authority into potential breaches of money-laundering rules.\nCherkasky’s final report is scheduled for next March after which it will be up to the DoJ to decide whether the terms of the DPA have been met.\nThe results were accompanied by pages of legal warnings, including a legal case which began in April 2017 into allegations that HSBC conspired with other banks to manipulate the the US bond market. There are other disclosures covering requests for information relating to the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca and investigations by tax authorities. \nHSBC also said it was cooperating with the DoJ over the way it packaged up toxic bonds in the run-up to the 20008 financial crisis. The investigation by DoJ, which has already reached settlements with eight other banks, is nearing completion, it added.\nIn the UK, HSBC’s results included a $300m hit for the payment protection insurance scandal. HSBC also said it had moved 170,000 accounts to new sort codes to comply with the new ringfencing protocols, known as the Vickers rules, which come into force at the start of 2019. Implementing these rules, which ring-fence high street bank operations from riskier investment banks, has cost £500m and involved 2,000 staff.\nStuart Gulliver, the bank’s chief executive, focused on the amount paid out to shareholders in the last year. “In the past 12 months we have paid more in dividends than any other European or American bank and returned $3.5bn to shareholders through share buybacks,” said Gulliver, who in the financial stages of a global plan to make savings of $5bn, cut 25,000 jobs and “pivot” the business towards Asia.\nHSBC has previously said Brexit could force the bank to move moving 1,000 staff to Paris, which Gulliver said would help avoid a loss $1bn of revenue.\nHe reitterated his intention to retire next year while Flint said there was strong list of internal candidates.\n",

        "text": "\nAirbus, Europe’s largest aerospace multinational, has launched an internal investigation into possible corruption after the Guardian uncovered a series of questionable financial transactions resulting in an unexplained payment.\nHundreds of pages of leaked bank records, internal memos and financial statements reveal that two companies secretly controlled by the aviation giant engaged in transactions involving €19m (£16.7m), a large part of which was then routed to a mysterious company via a tax haven.\nApproached for an explanation, Airbus was unable to say who had received the money, or why its control of the two companies was concealed. \nThe multinational, which employs 15,000 people at factories in the UK, said, however, that it was determined to investigate “historic business practices” and uncover any “improper practices to ensure that they can never happen again”. \nThe company is already facing corruption investigations in various jurisdictions, including the UK. \nThe Serious Fraud Office announced last year that it had started investigating allegations that the firm had lied about its use of middlemen in order to secure financial backing from the British government. A source close to Airbus said the €19m transaction is unrelated to any of the existing law enforcement enquiries.\nThe internal investigation was launched after the Guardian asked Airbus if the transactions could constitute money-laundering. One of the firms that knew about the transactions has said it had developed “reasonable suspicions” about them and had asked a court to investigate. \nThe scheme hinges on an unexplained purchase of shares between two purportedly independent companies in 2007. Eolia, a Maltese company in the business of retrofitting passenger jets to transport cargo, bought 26% of Avinco Holdings, a Dutch company that sells sells secondhand aircraft and helicopters. Both companies present themselves to the world as independent entities. Neither company’s website mentions any significant external support or backing from other firms.\nIn reality, however, both companies were secretly under Airbus’s effective control.\nLawyers for Eolia did not dispute that the firm had operated with secret backing. “Airbus had good, and indeed legitimate, commercial reason to protect its involvement in Eolia,” it aid, but that the reasons were confidential.\nAvinco Holdings was set up in 2000, principally financed by a UAE businessman, who held 14,999 Avinco shares through a holding company. Airbus owned just one share through a shell company called Yellow Sun Holdings in the tax haven of Curaçao, in the Caribbean.\nA secret agreement, however, granted Airbus the right to buy the UAE businessman out at any time, effectively seizing control of the company. In exchange, the businessman received a generous annual dividend equivalent to 20% of his total investment.\nAccording to bank documents, Eolia transferred €19.4m to the businessman’s holding company on 4 January 2007, with the transfer marked “share purchase Avinco”.\nEight days later, the holding company paid €16.2m to the bank account of a Panamanian company called Rochade Consultancy, and on the same day Rochade paid an identical sum to yet another company, Malana Holding. It is unclear who owns Malana, or where it is incorporated.\nThe €16.2m transaction then appears to have been accounted for unusually. The businessman’s holding company records the payment to Rochade as an “interim dividend” in internal financial documents. It is not clear why Rochade, which is not a shareholder in the holding company, would be entitled to any dividend.\nAirbus said: “As part of our ongoing compliance upgrade and investigation into historic business practices within the company, Airbus is determined to uncover any non-compliance and improper practices to ensure that they can never happen again.\n“Airbus cannot comment on the specific issues raised since other parties involved are in legal dispute over ownership and have their own commercial agendas at play. However, Airbus is investigating the situation thoroughly and none of the individuals referenced currently work for the company.\n\n\n\n\nContact the Guardian securely\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“If non-compliance is identified, the company will take all actions necessary to root it out, inform the relevant authorities and ensure those responsible are held accountable.”\nLawyers for Eolia said it had not decided the price paid for Avinco Holdings, but rather that it was “established by Airbus and funded by a loan guaranteed by Airbus”.\nThey said the proposed price was “justified having regard to the potential commercial benefits indicated by Airbus”. They also said Eolia had suspicions “about the conduct of third parties in relation to the share purchase”. It was “those reasonable suspicions” which it had asked a Dutch court to investigate as part of a legal case it had initiated against Avinco Holdings.\nThey denied Eolia had been involved in money-laundering and said that until recently the firm had no knowledge of the €16.2m payment. \nNeither the UAE businessman nor Avinco responded to requests for comment.\nAirbus receives huge financial support from the British, French and German governments to help exports. The British support amounted to £497m in 2015-16.\nUntil 2012, around 80% of all financial support issued to exporters by the British government was given to Airbus, which has factories in Filton near Bristol and Broughton in North Wales.\nAll support was temporarily suspended in 2016 when the SFO started investigating “irregularities” involving its use of middlemen to secure contracts overseas. France opened an investigation this year. \nAirbus has for the past few years been quietly terminating the operations of a little-known internal division called the Sales and Marketing Organisation, which spent years developing an international network of consultants to help the company secure high-value overseas contracts. The company’s chief executive, Tom Enders, who arrived in the job in 2012, has pushed for the dissolution of the division, which he reportedly referred to as “bullshit castle”.\n• If you would like to pass on information in confidence, you can send a message via the Guardian’s SecureDrop service.

        "text": "\nThe back-slapping in HSBC’s boardroom is understandable. Only 18 months ago investors were wondering if the dividend was in peril in a world where regulators insist on fatter capital buffers. Now the dividend looks so safe that HSBC can afford to throw a few billions of dollars at share buybacks. It’s been quite a turnaround. The share price has improved by a remarkable 55% in a year.\nHow has it happened? Trading conditions are gentle for most big banks, especially those that, like HSBC, are skewed toward Asia. But HSBC’s tale also shows what can happen when a big international bank stops shooting itself in the foot and avoids scandal. The cleanup of HSBC – forced by past scandals, notably the £1.2bn fine in the US for money-laundering offences plus tax avoidance scams in Switzerland – is finally delivering for shareholders.\nIn terms of the size of its balance sheet, HSBC hasn’t actually shrunk much. But it now operates in 68 countries, rather than 93 at the peak, which allows senior management to have a firmer grasp of what it is happening in the far corners of the empire. In parallel, HSBC has concentrated on organic growth, rather than chasing a quick buck via acquisitions, which was its habit in the late 1990s and early 2000s.\nThat expansion splurge delivered a few gems, but, in the round, it was a disaster, the purchase of US subprime lender Household being the worst of the lot. To simplify greatly, HSBC has spent about 10 years recovering from acquisitions it made in the previous decade. Very long-term shareholders can only wonder what might have been.\nMark Tucker becomes chair of HSBC in October. He should start by offering investors a firm pledge: if he is ever tempted to sanction a return to grandiose deal-making, he will lie down until the feeling goes away.\nThe game is up\nPayday lenders, in the days before the regulator imposed a price cap on their loans, used to peddle the argument that any clampdown on their business would only push hard-pressed punters into the arms of illegal loan sharks. The pitch, in other words, was: “You may not like us, but uglier operators are ready to take our place.”\nIt sounded like self-interested nonsense at the time, and so it has proved. The Financial Conduct Authority, which capped payday interest rates at 0.8% a day from January 2015, was able to report on Monday on a clear regulatory success.\nSome 63% of those turned down for a payday loan since the cap was introduced said they are better off as a result. There has not been significant extra use of other high-cost loans. And there is “no evidence” that those turned down for a payday loan are more likely to use illegal moneylenders. The FCA can congratulate itself on a job well done.\nFor its next trick, the regulator is turning its attention to banks and unarranged overdrafts. So it should. The market is very different, but high charges are a common feature. A Which? analysis showed that it can be 12.5 times more expensive to borrow £100 from some high street banks via an unarranged overdraft than to use a post-reform payday lender.\nIt seems the banks themselves know the game is up. Lloyds has announced that from November it will introduce a single fee of 1p a day for every £7 of overdraft used. One in 10 customers could pay more, but at least the structure is transparent and easy to understand, which is half the battle.\nOther high-street lenders should jump before they are pushed. When the regulator says it is considering whether unarranged overdrafts should even have a place in modern banking, it is already obvious that the current set-up is not going to survive.\nIt’s the details that matter\nIn her first outing as chair of the Treasury select committee, Nicky Morgan wants a report from the Bank of England on how banks and insurers are preparing for Brexit, with particular reference to the risks created by a “no deal” outcome.\nIn theory, this request should be unremarkable since the Bank itself asked firms in April for their contingency plans. It counts as noteworthy only because Threadneedle Street had not committed itself to offering a public opinion on preparations.\nMorgan is right to insist that the silence should be broken. Abstract talk about the desirability of transitional arrangements is fine as it goes. In the end, it’s the details that will matter. A good technocratic assessment by the Bank would tell us more about where the City stands than any outsider’s guess about the likely number of job losses. The Bank shouldn’t worry about treading on politicians’ toes – this stuff is more important than that.\n",

        "text": "\nHundreds of landless agricultural workers have invaded farms belonging to Brazil’s agriculture minister, the former president of the Brazilian soccer association, and a close friend of President Michel Temer.\nThe invasions on Tuesday form part of a campaign called “Corrupt People! Give Us Back Our Land” launched by the Landless Workers Movement – known by its Portuguese initials, MST – launched to ramp up pressure on Temer before a 2 August congressional vote on whether he should stand trial on corruption charges.\n“We are going to continue the occupations until the eve of the vote,” said João Paulo Rodrigues, one of the MST’s national organisers. \n\n\n\n\nBrazil faces fresh turmoil after President Temer charged with corruption\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTemer’s government has stumbled from crisis to crisis since he assumed power last year. The latest began in May, when he was secretly recorded during an unofficial, late-night meeting with Joesley Batista, whose family controls the meat giant JBS, apparently encouraging obstruction of a graft probe and recommending the executive deal with an aide. Temer has denied any wrongdoing and vowed to continue his government’s programme of austerity measures.\nTemer was charged with corruption in the case in June. If two-thirds of Brazil’s lower house of Congress approve the charges on 2 August, he will be suspended and tried by Brazil’s supreme court. Government ministers say they have enough support to ensure the vote does not pass.\nOne of the farms invaded, near Rondonópolis in Mato Grosso state, is owned by Amaggi, a farming and logistics giant founded by the father of Brazil’s agriculture minister, Blairo Maggi, who formerly presided over the company. In a statement, the company said it was concerned about the safety of 17 workers and their families.\nEarlier this year, a supreme court judge authorised the investigation of Maggi and seven other ministers after executives of the Odebrecht construction conglomerate said they made illegal campaign donations to him. He denies the allegations.\nAnother farm invaded, in Rio de Janeiro state, is owned by Ricardo Teixeira, former president of the Brazilian Football Confederation and member of Fifa’s executive committee. In 2015, Teixeira was indicted in the United States for racketeering, conspiracy and corruption. More recently, Spanish prosecutors have issued an arrest warrant for him on charges of money laundering and racketeering. \nA third invaded farm, in São Paulo state, is owned by João Lima Filho, a former police officer and close friend of Temer. A JBS executive alleged that Lima received bribe money for the president in testimony. Protesters also occupied land belonging to senator Ciro Nogueira, who is also being investigated following testimony from Odebrecht executives.\nThe MST is closely allied with the Worker’s party of the former presidents Dilma Rousseff and Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva – known as Lula. Rousseff was impeached last August and replaced by Temer, her former vice-president. Earlier this month, Lula was sentenced to nearly 10 years in jail on corruption and money laundering charges but remains at liberty while he appeals the sentence.\nDavid Fleischer, emeritus professor of political science at the University of Brasília, said the invasions were unlikely to influence lawmakers in a congress where a powerful agribusiness lobby wields considerable influence.\n“It’s a political manoeuvre, an attempt for headline grabbing.” Fleisher said. “It’s pressure politics.” \n",

        "text": "\nOver the Thanksgiving break Congress will have time to start digesting Donald Trump’s plans to implement the largest tax overhaul in a generation. It already has Trump’s critics – and several leading Republicans – reaching for the Tums.\nAccording to the president, the tax plans had some simple aims: to spur business investment by cutting corporate taxes, give middle-class America a tax break and simplify a byzantine tax system. It hasn’t proved quite so simple, or palatable. With two versions of the bill now under discussion in Congress, the final shape of the plan is still unclear but some losers and winners are emerging. The clear winners? Rich people and corporations. The clear losers? Poor people, the vulnerable. And America.\n\n\n\n\nTrump's Panama tower used for money-laundering by condo owners, reports say\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rich\nThe Trump clan (and his 1% cohort) will be among the biggest winners if either the House or Senate plan becomes law. And one of their biggest wins will go to their families in the form of elimination of the estate tax.\nThe estate tax only affects people who leave a fortune of $5.49m or above to their heirs. Parents can leave $11m to their children without paying the tax. The House bill doubles that exemption until 2024 and then eliminates it entirely at a cost of $151bn to the taxpayer over the next decade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  The treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, right, and his wife Louise Linton, hold up a sheet of new $1 bills, the first currency notes bearing his and US treasurer Jovita Carranza’s signatures. Photograph: Jacquelyn Martin/AP\n\n\nEven Steven Mnuchin, Trump’s billionaire treasury secretary, has said admitted this is a move that benefits only the rich. “Obviously, the estate tax, I will concede, disproportionately helps rich people,” he said last month.\nThe cut would save the Trump family $1.15bn when he dies, according to the Center for American Progress Action Fund.\nGone also would be the alternative minimum tax (AMT), introduced in 1969 to prevent the rich from escaping paying their fair share of tax via tax loopholes.\nAMT mainly affects those earning over $500,000, according to Tax Policy Center. In 2005 the rule was responsible for $31m of the $38m Trump paid in federal taxes, according to leaked documents.\nLowering taxes on pass through businesses will also help the rich. Pass through businesses are businesses taxed at the rate of the business owner. The current proposals would cut the top rate these companies pay to 25%, far below the 39.6% highest rate of personal income tax.\nAccording to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities some 80% of the benefit of these cuts would go to those earning $1m or more – giving them an average increase of $50,000 in 2018. A similar plan in Kansas led to a budget crisis after the state’s tax revenues plummeted and promises of increased economic activity failed to materialize.\nTrump controls some 500 pass through entities and he would save about $16m a year from the cuts, according to the New York Times.\nCorporations\nTrump’s plan would cut the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%, the lowest point since 1939. The idea is that lower taxes will allow business leaders to increase capital investment and create more jobs. But the fact is that most US corporations pay far less than 35% tax already, many of the most profitable pay nothing and lower taxes have not been shown to create jobs. There is also little evidence that the current system is harming business given that both stock markets and corporate profits are at record highs while employment is at lows unseen since the turn of the millennium.\nLast week business leaders too seemed to pour cold water on the idea that lower taxes would spur investment, and embarrassed one of the key architects of the bill, Trump’s chief economic adviser, Gary Cohn, in the process.\nWhen a crowd of CEOs at a Wall Street Journal conference last Tuesday was asked to raise their hands if they planned to raise capital expenditures if the tax cuts passed, few raised their hands.\n“Why aren’t the other hands up?” Cohn asked, looking uncomfortable. Probably because they are more likely to hand the money back to shareholders in the form of higher dividends and share buybacks.\n\n\nNatalie Andrews \n(@nataliewsj)\nVIDEO: CEOs asked if they plan to increase their company's capital investments if the GOP's tax bill passes. A few hands go up. \"Why aren't the other hands up?\" Gary Cohn asks.#WSJCEOCouncil pic.twitter.com/TD2oAlN27S\n\nNovember 14, 2017\n\n\nThe poor and vulnerable\nAccording to the Joint Committee on Taxation the latest version of the Senate tax bill would effectively raise taxes for lower-income Americans by 2021.\nStarting in 2021, a year after the next election, Americans earning $10,000 to $30,000 a year or less would pay higher taxes if the bill passes thanks to plans to repeal a core element of Obama’s Affordable Care Act.\nThe Senate bill would kill the so-called individual mandate, which requires all Americans to take out health insurance and hands them a tax rebate in return. Repealing that would leave 13 million more people without insurance and would increase many people’s tax burdens by removing the tax break.\nThe JCT also calculates that most Americans earning $75,000 or less would be paying higher taxes by 2027.\nPaying for the tax cuts is likely to mean cuts to social security and Medicare, the federal program that provides health insurance to those 65 and older.\nThe House bill is also proposing to eliminate tax deductions for medical expenses that exceed 10% of a taxpayer’s total income. More than half of the 8.6 million people who claim the deduction are older than 65, 49% had income less than $50,000, and 69% earned less than $75,000, according to AARP, the lobby group for older Americans, which has 38 million members. \n\n\nAARP Advocates \n(@AARPadvocates)\n8.6 MM Americans count on the medical expense deduction for much needed relief from high health care costs.

As a result, trillion-dollar deficits would return by 2020 and debt would exceed the size of the economy in just over a decade,” they calculate.\n",

        "text": "\nThe City regulator is investigating HSBC over potential breaches of money laundering rules after concerns raised last year by the anti-crime monitor installed in Britain’s biggest bank.\nThe bank did not disclose the specific concerns raised by the American lawyer Michael Cherkasky, who was appointed as the monitor five years ago. He is reported to have raised concerns about clients with links to terrorism, including Isis.\nChekraksy was appointed after the £1.2bn fine imposed on HSBC in 2012 by the US for poor anti-money laundering controls and is overseeing attempts to improve its defences against financial crime.\nThe Financial Conduct Authority did not comment but the bank said it was “the subject of an investigation by the FCA into its compliance with UK money laundering regulations and financial crime systems and controls requirements”.\nAs the bank reported a 62% slump in 2016 profits on Tuesday, its chief executive Stuart Gulliver said the bank was unearthing more regulatory problems due to higher-quality internal policing, adding the business had “been able to identify more bad actors in our 37m customer base”. He said it was “quite normal” to uncover such instances in a bank the size of HSBC which operates in 70 countries and has 240,000 staff.\nGulliver said: “Our monitor has raised certain concerns but we have continued to progress and our commitment remains unwavering. By the end of this year, we are on track to have our anti-money laundering and sanctions policy framework in place and to have introduced major compliance IT systems across the group.”\nHe described the FCA’s investigation as a section 166 reportwhich means a review by an independent firm that could lead to fines if wrong doing is uncovered.\nCherkasky’s criticism that HSBC was too slow to improve its systems was taken into account when paying top staff: the part of Gulliver’s pay measured against compliance with financial crime received a 65% rating from the remuneration committee, compared with 75% a year earlier. This was reported to amount to a 2.5% cut. \nSam Laidlaw, the non-executive director who chairs the remuneration committee, said this followed “feedback received from the monitor, matters arising from risk and compliance incidents, and a number of unsatisfactory internal audits covering anti-money laundering (AML) and sanctions-related issues”.\nEven so Gulliver’s overall pay is ising from £7.3m to £7.7m. Pay of “certain individuals” was reduced by $12.1m (£9.7m) to “reflect their involvement in certain notable events and individual transgressions” while 245 were paid more than £1m compared with 226 a year ago. One received €11m (£8.8m).\nThe overall bonus pool was cut by 12% – which will be closely watched as all the other major UK banks report in their results in the coming days.\nThe monitor had also expressed concerns a year ago and on Tuesday HSBC highlighted concerns “instances of potential finance crime that the DoJ [department of justice] and HSBC are reviewing further and on-going systems and control deficiencies that in [the monitor’s] view raised questions as to about whether HSBC is adhering to all its obligations under the US DPA”.\nGulliver has been pulling back from riskier operations, including its Swiss private bank and the 62% fall in profits – down to $7.1bn – was in part caused by a $3.2bn writedown on the total value of the takeover of the Safra private bank in 1999. In 2015, the Guardian and other publications revealed the Swiss arm of HSBC helped clients dodge tax and the bank revealed it had now set aside $773m aside for various tax investigations.\nWithout the one-off hits, profits were flat at $19.3bn and the bank tried to please shareholders by buying back $1bn of shares, on top of $2.5bn announced in August. The dividend is held at 51 cents a share.\nBut the bank’s shares, which have risen 55% since the EU referendum, endured one of their biggest one day falls since the depths of the banking crisis. Ian Gordon, an analyst at Investec said, said the figures were a “grim reality” while analysts at Bernstein said “HSBC missed on income and capital”. \nRevenue fell in 2016, a year which chairman Douglas Flint said would be “long remembered for its significant and largely unexpected economic and political events”.\nInvestors looking for news about Flint’s successor may have been left disappointed as he said an announcement would be made “in due course”. Gulliver indicated Flint could stay on until next year if a replacement was not found until later in 2017. Laidlaw, who is leading the search for Flint’s replacement, is leaving at the annual meeting. \nFlint highlighted potential risks to the markets, including “the threat of populism impacting policy choices in upcoming European elections”, while Gulliver talked about the end of globalisation.\n“If globalisation continues to retreat, as seems likely, we are in a strong position to capitalise on the regional opportunities that this will present, particularly in Asia and Europe,” said Gulliver.\nFlint said the bank would need to relocate 1,000 staff from London to Paris “progressively over the next two years” as a result of the Brexit vote but half of them were French.\n\n \n",

        "text": "\nMexico’s attorney general has said there are indications that Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán invested in a tequila brand developed by Kate del Castillo, the actor whose contacts with the world’s most wanted man appear to have contributed to his capture. \n“We have an investigation in the tequila case,” Arely Gómez told the newspaper El Universal, though she acknowledged lacking “legal certainty” any crimes had been committed. She added that the Hollywood star Sean Penn – who met El Chapo at an encounter arranged by Del Castillo – was not under investigation, nor was anyone else involved in the production of a proposed biopic of the drug boss.\nOfficials now want to question Del Castillo over possible money laundering after evidence emerged to suggest that Guzmán sank drug money into her company, Gómez said. \nDel Castillo, whose “Honor” tequila brand was supposed to be launched this month, has stayed silent on the allegations against her and any relationship with El Chapo, although in a brief statement on Twitter last week she said she would eventually tell her side of the story.\nThe one-time telenovela starlet – known for candid criticisms of the governing Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI) – has come under intense scrutiny since El Chapo’s arrest 8 January in his home state of Sinaloa. Widespread media coverage of her contacts with Guzmán, fed by copious leaks from investigators and spiced with speculation over the exact nature of their relationship, has at times taken the spotlight off proceedings against the cartel boss, as well as other stories of crime and corruption, such as the arrest last week of former PRI governor Humberto Moreira on suspicion of embezzlement, money laundering and bribery. \n“Since El Chapo’s arrest, most of the story has evolved into one big telenovela,” said security analyst Jorge Kawas. “Few have asked the tough questions: who in politics is behind Mexican drug trafficking and other criminal organisations?” \nSurveillance photos published last week by El Universal showed Del Castillo and Penn arriving in Mexico for their trip to meet El Chapo at a hideaway in the hills of Sinaloa, while text messages between the starlet and the cartel boss suggested that El Chapo was interested in the actress for reasons unrelated to film-making. \nBut some commentators have expressed skepticism about the leaked text messages between Guzmán and Del Castillo, who came to fame with her portrayal of a female cartel boss in the TV series La Reina del Sur (Queen of the South).\n“If Kate del Castillo committed a crime, she should be punished,” wrote columnist Mario Campos. “But enough of this show to turn a TV villain into a real-life public enemy.”\nLeaked information from investigations has come to characterise some of Mexico’s most notorious cases. After the brutal murder of photojournalist Ruben Espinosa, activist Nadia Vera and three women in a Mexico City apartment, details from the investigation regularly appeared on newspaper front pages – but only those which reflected the official line that the killings were unrelated to death threats received by Espinosa and Vera for their work in Veracruz state.\nGuzmán’s arrest was a major coup for the government, but evidence suggests that targeting cartel kingpins does little to stop the flow of narcotics or prevent drug-fuelled corruption. Meanwhile, Mexico has appeared unable to dismantle illegal financial networks that launder drug money and bind the cartels to networks of business and political patronage, said Kawas.\n “It’s easier to go after someone like Kate del Castillo, a public figure who’s famous and recognisable by many Mexicans,” Kawas said, “than to go deeper into the Sinaloa cartel’s intricate network of financial and political facilitators.”\n",

        "text": "\nSo Narcos is back for a third season, which takes us beyond the death of its hitherto protagonist Pablo Escobar into the world of his rivals, the Cali cartel. An interesting shift is afoot if a remark from showrunner Eric Newman is anything to go by: “Unlike Escobar, who had positioned himself as an outlaw, Cali was very much a part of the system.”\nNarcos season three calls the Cali cartel “the biggest drug lords you’ve never heard of” – with good reason. The Rodríguez Orejuela brothers Gilberto and Miguel and Jose Santacruz Londoño are not the household names they could, should – and soon will – be.\nThe Cali cartel split from Escobar’s Medellin syndicate years before his death, to become the trader of what some estimate as a 90% share of the global cocaine market, spearheading the supply into Europe during the “yuppie” boom of the 1980s.\nBut unlike Escobar, the Cali cartel didn’t wage war on the system – they became part of it.\n\n\n\n\nEl Chapo: Netflix's gruesome, gripping answer to The Wire\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst they dominated their region, and then national politics – even compromising a Colombian president. They didn’t want to attack the state, as Escobar did with cartel gunmen and rogue police; they wanted to be the state. Their financial affairs were so well managed that Gilberto Rodríguez founded and directed the First InterAmericas bank in Panama – he did so effectively enough to become Escobar’s banker while also trying to kill his rival. Meanwhile, the expertise of the cartel’s counter-intelligence systems baffled the CIA and the Drug Enforcement Agency.\nThe series seems, estimably, to want to follow not the story of one man, but the ever-expanding business he created. In doing so, Narcos season three will also illustrate a key point about the nature of cartels: the way in which they morph and mutate from generation to generation.\nThe famous Sinaloa cartel of Joaquín ‘El Chapo’ Guzmán, now awaiting trial in a New York jail from which he is unlikely to be tunnelled out, was a mutation of both Escobar and Cali. He was the last of the baron bosses, a “Godfather” revered as well as feared on his terrain. But he had moved beyond Escobar to find an accommodation with the state: his network of protection within the Mexican state made him the state’s best bet in trying to keep a perverse “pax mafiosa” – mafia peace – against even more vicious drug syndicates. \nThe latest cartel mutation is Los Zetas, from north-eastern Mexico. This is a narco-militia so brutal that – in contrast to Guzmán’s baronial status – its name is barely even mentioned within the expanding territory under its control, from the Rio Grande valley down the Gulf into Central America. They rule with raw terror, not patronage. They forge into Europe, regardless of what is licit or illicit, be it cocaine, sex-trafficking, migration or oil – all that matters is business and ultra-violence to secure it. \nThe Zetas are Escobar’s great grandchildren, the Cali cartel’s grandchildren, and Guzmán’s defiant sons.\nAlong with Narcos, the past few years have seen a flurry of films and books about narco-traffic. When I wrote a book about the drug war in Mexico in 2010, it was one among few. Now, narco-traffic is on trend and clearly lucrative.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Wagner Moura as Pablo Escobar in Narcos. Photograph: Daniel Daza/AP\n\n\nSadly, the narratives developed in those shows mean that audiences in the US and Europe understand it as a cops-and-robbers thriller, obscuring what narcos actually are: astute, ever-adapting businessmen in the legal and illicit economy, supplying products on which our society is more dependent than ever. The fight is seen as a just war against criminal organisations who are at war with us. Our good guys, their bad guys.\nBut here’s the problem: it’s not true. The idea that there is some kind of line between “us” and “them”, or the “legal” and “illegal” economies, is a fantasy and a lie. The world of narcos is not some exotic underworld horror show, because there is nothing underworld about the money.\nAsk yourself: what happens to the money? If Escobar’s and Guzmán’s is a multi-billion dollar business, where is it?\nEscobar and Guzmán could not drive around spending hundreds of billions out of the back of a truck. No, you have to bank it, and to do that, you have to find a bank willing to take your money. Escobar found the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, and it was busted. Guzmán found Wachovia and HSBC, which have been caught and admitted laundering his money. Yet no one goes to jail.\nThe New York Times articulated it rather well: “Federal and state authorities have chosen not to indict HSBC, the London-based bank, on charges of vast and prolonged money-laundering, for fear that criminal prosecution would topple the bank and, in the process, endanger the financial system.” \n\n\n\n\nCocaine more addictive than first thought, study finds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWithout “criminal” money, the “legal” economy collapses. The man who infiltrated Escobar’s Medellin cartel to bust BCCI for the FBI, Robert Mazur, put it thus when we met: “The only thing that will make the banks properly vigilant to what is happening is the rattle of handcuffs in the boardroom” – not just in the Narcos’ palaces. “It’s simple”, said the whistleblower at Wachovia, Martin Woods: “If you don’t see the correlation between the money laundering by banks andpeople killed in Mexico, you’re missing the point.”\nSeries three of Narcos is unlikely to join those dots – it is, after all, a series about Colombia, not Wall Street or Canary Wharf. And even this is important: Colombia has just agreed a peace that ends the world’s longest-running war, between its government and the Marxist Farc.

        "text": "\nThe Serious Fraud Office has launched an investigation into a company run by a major Conservative donor who is one of the prime minister’s business ambassadors. \nPetrofac, which provides services to the oil and gas industry, is being investigated by the SFO over suspected bribery, corruption and money laundering. \nIts chief executive, Ayman Asfari, and his wife have given the Tories more than £700,000 since 2009, with the party receiving £40,000 last December. The Syrian-born businessman has been questioned under caution by the SFO, along with another member of Petrofac’s senior management team.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Ayman Asfari became chief executive of Petrofac in 2002. Photograph: Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\n\nAsfari is a member of the leader’s group, an elite set of donors who give the Conservative party at least £50,000 a year and are invited to join the prime minister and other senior Tories at dinners. As a business ambassador, Asfari can carry out meetings on behalf of the British government while travelling overseas and also lead trade missions.\nAccording to the government’s website, he is entitled to hold one-to-one meetings with senior government ministers and host “high-level incoming visitors”. There are 44 business ambassadors, including Douglas Flint, the chairman of HSBC, and Natalie Massenet, the founder of fashion retailer Net-a-Porter. \nThe investigation is part of the SFO’s inquiry into Unaoil, a Monaco-based firm that has been accused of corruptly securing contracts for multinationals. Unaoil has denied any wrongdoing. \nPetrofac employed Unaoil for consultancy work in Kazakhstan between 2002 and 2009. Unaoil was also hired to work in various parts of the world by the British engineering company Rolls-Royce, which recently admitted corruption and bribery after an SFO investigation. \nA spokesman for Petrofac said the company had been notified by the SFO that the investigation had begun, adding: “The company is cooperating with the authorities.”\nPetrofac had previously brought in lawyers and auditors to examine its links to Unaoil. After investigations by law firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer and accountants KPMG last summer, Petrofac said “no evidence was found that any director of the company was aware of the alleged misconduct”. It then shared its findings with the SFO. \nAn SFO spokesman confirmed it was investigating “the activities of Petrofac PLC, its subsidiaries, and their officers, employees and agents for suspected bribery, corruption and money laundering”.\nPetrofac has 31 offices around the world and 13,500 staff, and operates in countries including Algeria, Iraq and Abu Dhabi. Asfari joined the company in 1991 and bought it out 10 years later, becoming chief executive in 2002. The chief operating officer, Marwan Chedid, has also been interviewed under caution by SFO investigators.\nAccording to its website, Petrofac is focused on Africa and the Middle East. Most of its clients are national oil companies, including Saudi Aramco. \nLast year, the company’s revenues were $7.9bn (£6.1bn). Petrofac’s share price fell around 15% after the SFO announced its investigation. Forbes magazine has calculated Asfari’s worth to be about $970m. \nA Conservative party spokesman said: “All donations to the Conservative party are properly and transparently declared to the Electoral Commission, published by them, and comply fully with the law.”\n",

        "text": "\nAzerbaijan may not mean that much to you. In the west it is perhaps best known as a plucky winner of the Eurovision song contest, or maybe easy opponents in qualification for another international football tournament. It has oil, a Caspian Sea coastline and 10 million people.\nBut there is another side. \nJournalism is a crime in my country – the numbers say it all: 10 out of 158 political prisoners in Azerbaijan are journalists. The last remaining independent news agency, Turan, stopped work last week.\nThere is a high price for defiance. I was subjected to blackmail with intimate videos, filmed by secret services in my private home. I was jailed for a litany of trumped-up charges. I was not alone.\n\n\n\n\nUK at centre of secret $3bn Azerbaijani money laundering and lobbying scheme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Azerbaijani regime has a strong rationale for such oppression. The lack of independent media and civil society secures absolute impunity for corruption – a free hand for the elite to build their hotels and develop their mining interests. They don’t want to be questioned on where the wealth comes from and why the public money does not serve public interests. \nCorruption paralyses education and healthcare while the country’s ruling family and their entourage enrich themselves at the expense of the ordinary people. \nMeanwhile, those who put activists in jail, oppress the people and paralyse civil society enjoy impunity for stealing people’s opportunity and freedoms. And they remain free and powerful enough to continue repression. They invest their money in democracies, where property rights are respected, unlike in Azerbaijan. They go to western countries and receive quality medical care – the quality denied to people in Azerbaijan. Their children receive education abroad, and enjoy other products of democracy – the same rights they deny ordinary Azerbaijanis. \n\nAzerbaijani Laundromat atom\n\nThe Azerbaijani Laundromat provides a tantalising glimpse into the way this kleptocracy works.\nNone of the corruption investigations done by me or my colleagues led to investigations by the government of Azerbaijan. Instead, journalists were punished – killed, like Elmar Huseynov; arrested, like me. Kidnapping and beating of journalists became routine in Azerbaijan. \nAnd still, those who punish journalists for telling the truth and deprive them of basic freedoms are welcome in democracies, can freely travel, invest, have bank accounts, and transfer cash that’s been stolen from the state budget. Their hands are shaken by the leaders of countries whose organisations and partners are targeted and harassed in Azerbaijan.\nSo what is the point in telling the truth? The day I was sentenced to seven and a half years in prison, I was asked this very question repeatedly. What is the point of what you are doing and suffering for, asked the court clerk. “No matter what you write, you can’t change anything,” said the prison guard. “Everything you do is right, but it is all in vain,” repeated my cellmate when I was looking for ways to smuggle stories from prison despite the risks. Well, prison is definitely not a meeting point of optimists. \n\nAzerbaijani Laundromat how it works\n\nThe people of Azerbaijan, whose votes are stolen in elections, see no option for change and no effective support from international institutions. The rule by permanent dynasty seems like an inevitable reality of their life. With the president, who inherited power from his father and appointed his wife as vice-president, enabling her to replace him in his absence, the majority of Azerbaijanis see little possibility for change in the coming election year of 2018. \nElections in Azerbaijan have never met international standards. Observation missions by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe have reported major falsifications in previous presidential and parliamentary vote counting. Nevertheless, Azerbaijani TV stations, serving as mouthpieces of the regime, show foreign politicians and members of western parliaments praising the level of democracy in Azerbaijan.\nEven now, when prices for Azerbaijan’s main commodity – oil – fall, the government is spending huge amounts to corrupt European institutions and influence politicians, as the Laundromat revelations show. The regime is trying to ease criticism over human rights in order to secure billions of international loans for its mega projects, which will serve merely to prolong its own life. \n\n\n\n\nFreed journalist Khadija Ismayilova: 'They didn't succeed in silencing me'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAzerbaijanis are not naive. They understand that putting western politicians in service costs money. They also understand why the Azerbaijani regime is trying to block the truth inside and outside the country. \nBut the government will fail in these attempts to silence everyone, as there is a truth-telling machine in every house – the empty refrigerator. Azerbaijanis understand quite well that the wealth of oligarchs we expose has been built at the expense of their empty fridges and the time will come when the anger of poverty will explode.\n\nKhadjia Ismayilova is an Azerbaijani investigative journalist and member of the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project\n\n",

        "text": "\nMichael Wolff’s new book, Fire and Fury, is an unforgettable ringside view of the reckless and undignified spectacle of the Donald Trump presidency so far. It will not surprise anyone that the US president comes across as a vain, delusional and unstable character whose public utterances could mostly be disproved by provable facts. Unable to master the presidential mien, Mr Trump has chosen to defile it. Without experienced advisers and consiglieres, Trump’s White House was divided into two camps: one led by his daughter, Ivanka, and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and the other by Steve Bannon, a Mephistophelian figure credited with channelling passions that more conventional politicians have been careful not to exploit. Mr Bannon, once Mr Trump’s chief strategist, is the book’s unkempt star. It is through his rise and fall that we learn how unsuited Mr Trump is to the world’s most demanding job.\nMr Bannon’s view is that Mr Trump is not likely to make it to the end of his first term. Either the president is brought down by the “treasonous” and “unpatriotic” meetings held by his son and a group of Russians or by federal prosecutors who unearth serious financial crimes. On this analysis Mr Bannon gave Mr Trump equal chances of staying in office, being removed by Congress or being declared mentally unfit for office.\nThe last option seems far-fetched, but the US constitution’s 25th amendment allows for a president to be removed if he is “unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office”. Such is Mr Trump’s divisiveness that a social movement of mental-health professionals has sprung up which argues Mr Trump suffers from incurable malignant narcissism and this renders him unfit for office. This is a break with conventions adopted in the wake of the failed rightwing US presidential candidate Barry Goldwater’s successful legal action against a magazine after it published a story in 1964 saying medics declared him so “severely paranoid” that he should not be able to become president. Since then psychiatrists have largely refrained from giving opinions about figures they have not personally examined.\nIt is a measure of how troubled the White House is seen to be that senior Republicans openly worry that the president is unravelling. Yet however erratic Mr Trump might be and however unsuited for high office, Republican voters remain loyal. Despite the rhetoric, Mr Trump’s base is largely made up of well-off and rightwing citizens rather than white, working-class voters struggling in a rapidly shifting global economy. This explains why his singular accomplishment, the Trump tax cut, will hurt poorer voters more than the Wall Street fatcats he railed against on the campaign trail.\nTime will tell whether the details in Wolff’s book are completely true. Mr Trump lived up to his billing as a thin-skinned political neophyte by having his lawyer threaten the author with a lawsuit. If the government couldn’t stop publication of the classified Pentagon Papers, the US president certainly could not stop a book that offends no one but himself. Written without much hindsight and without access to official papers, Wolff’s tome is more than journalism, if less than history. He has collected raw gossip and spiky insights in the court of King Donald. Historians will make more authoritative assessments. Viewing events from a distance makes it easier to decide what is a chapter of history and what is a footnote. Fire and Fury is not the definitive book on the Trump presidency, offering instead a worrying glimpse of its chaotic early life.\n",

        "text": "\nThe investigative firm behind the Steele dossier – the controversial memo that alleged extensive collusion between Donald Trump’s campaign officials and Russia – has claimed that the FBI received “credible allegations” about a Kremlin conspiracy throughout the 2016 US election campaign, including from inside the Trump camp.\nAn op-ed in the New York Times written by Glenn Simpson and Peter Fritsch, the former journalists and founders of investigative firm Fusion GPS, said congressional intelligence committees, which are conducting their own investigations into the Trump campaign, have been aware of the allegations for months.\n“We don’t believe the Steele dossier was the trigger for the FBI’s investigation into Russian meddling,” they wrote. “As we told the Senate judiciary committee in August, our sources said the dossier was taken so seriously because it corroborated reports the bureau had received from other sources, including one inside the Trump camp.”\nThe op-ed also called on lawmakers to examine financial institutions that were funding the US president’s businesses.\nThe article represents the first time that Simpson and Fritsch have offered a detailed public account of their firm’s involvement in the Russia investigation. In it, they allege that Republican lawmakers are waging a “cynical campaign” to portray Fusion GPS and the now infamous Steele dossier as “unwitting victims of Kremlin disinformation”.\nThe Steele dossier first came to public attention a year ago, when it was published by Buzzfeed. The memos written by a former British intelligence agent and Russia expert, Christopher Steele, made a series of allegations, including multiple secret meetings between Trump campaign officials and Russian agents.\nTrump has decried all the allegations as false, and has adamantly denied there was any collusion between his campaign and Russia.\nFour individuals, including three former campaign officials, have so far been indicted as part of an ongoing criminal federal investigation into whether or not Trump officials conspired with the Kremlin, including Michael Flynn, Trump’s former national security adviser, who has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI. Flynn is now cooperating with the investigation.\nFor months, it was suspected that the Steele dossier, which was shared with US intelligence agencies after the 2016 election, may have prompted the FBI’s decision to open an investigation into the matter. \nBut subsequent reporting, including by the Guardian and the New York Times, has shown that US intelligence agencies were prompted to investigate the issues before they received the dossier. The Guardian reported in April that foreign intelligence services, including Britain’s GCHQ, were among the first to alert US counterparts to contacts between Trump’s campaign and Kremlin operatives.\nThe New York Times reported last week that Australian officials passed information about a Trump foreign policy adviser, George Papadopoulos, to US counterparts after he bragged that Russia had compromising information about Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate.\nEven as new facts emerge and key officials have been indicted, including Paul Manafort, Trump’s former campaign chairman, the focus of some congressional committees has been fixed on Simpson, the former investigative reporter for the Wall Street Journal and co-founder of Fusion GPS.\nIn his op-ed, Simpson compared Republican attacks against him, which have been led in the Senate by Iowa Republican Chuck Grassley, to efforts by Republicans to protect Richard Nixon during the Watergate era. Simpson has testified before three congressional committees – albeit behind closed doors – and has explained how his clients, the Washington Free Beacon and the Clinton campaign, came to hire Fusion GPS, setting off the private investigation into the Trump campaign.\nInstead of focusing on the Russia claims, Simpson said, key Republicans have instead made him the focus of their investigations.\nHe wrote: “We walked investigators through our year-long effort to decipher Mr Trump’s complex business past, of which the Steele dossier is but one chapter. And we handed over our relevant bank records – while drawing the line at a fishing expedition for the records of companies we work for that have nothing to do with the Trump case.”\nRepublicans have so far declined to release any of the transcripts of Simpson’s interviews. Simpson said his testimony included allegations of widespread evidence that Trump and his organisation had worked with a wide array of “dubious Russians” in arrangements that raised questions about money laundering.\nSimpson also denied knowledge of a 9 June 2016 meeting that took place between Trump campaign officials, including Trump’s son, Donald Trump Jr, and some Russian officials. The meeting is now under scrutiny of Robert Mueller, the special counsel leading the investigation.\nSimpson has been accused of having a hand in the meeting because of past and allegedly unrelated work that his firm did in connection to some of the Russians who attended the meeting.\nSimpson added: “We’re extremely proud of our work to highlight Mr Trump’s Russia ties. To have done so is our right under the first amendment.”\n",

        "text": "\nSicilian mafia clans are decamping north to Germany in search of business opportunities in response to poor economic conditions in southern Europe and an Italian government crackdown on organised crime.\nDetails obtained by the Guardian of a large-scale anti-drug operation in Germany’s south-west reveal the extent to which mafia clans are said to have migrated to some of the wealthiest regions of Europe’s economic powerhouse after running into financial problems in Italy.\nNineteen suspected drug traffickers were arrested and €4m worth of goods and money seized in the south-western town of Villingen-Schwenningen on 21 June, in a joint raid by the Palermo branch of the Italian finance police and Germany’s criminal investigation department.\nThe gang was allegedly operating mainly in Rottweil and Stuttgart in Baden-Württemberg, which borders France and Switzerland and has the lowest poverty rate of all of Germany’s 16 states.\nAccording to Italian authorities, the arrested mobsters smuggled tons of marijuana and cocaine from Albania to Germany and laundered the profits in slot machines that they forced owners of local bars and shops to install.\nItalian police also suspect that profits from drug trafficking were used to buy weapons in the Balkans.\nIn 2016, a 300-strong team of investigators started using wiretaps and hidden cameras to track the suspects’ movements. One of the wiretaps seen by the Guardian records a drive-by shooting in May 2016 in which gang members are said to have shattered the window of a bar to intimidate an owner who had refused to install slot machines managed by the mafia.\nInvestigators say the drug traffickers were working in Germany at the service of the Mondino family, a Sicilian mafia gang based in Palermo in the Passo di Riganò neighbourhood.\nThe man in charge of the drug-smuggling and the money-laundering operations is believed to be a German-born Italian businessman who owns two restaurants in Baden-Württemberg. According to the Italian finance police in Palermo, the suspect has strong ties with several Sicilian mobsters.\nSicily’s most powerful mafia gang, the Cosa Nostra, is also believed to have started expanding to Germany.\nAccording to figures from the Italian ministry of the interior, 4,000 mobsters have been arrested in Sicily since 1990. \nSicily’s construction work market, one of the most important mafia businesses in the region, has been severely hit by the economic crisis. According to ANCE, the Italian construction businessmen association, profits in the industry have dropped by 90% since 2007.\nUnable to pay protection money, Sicilian shopkeepers and businessmen are said to be increasingly reporting approaches by the Cosa Nostra to the police.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  A policeman stands in front the house where a mafia boss was arrested in Sicily, Italy. Photograph: Luca Bruno/AP\n\n\n“The Italian mafia, including the powerful ‘Ndrangheta in Calabria, has invested money and goods in Germany in the last years. As other legal companies in Europe, they have found very profitable business opportunities there,” said Giuseppe Campobasso, who heads the the Italian financial police force’s anti-drug unit in Sicily and led the operation in Germany from the Italian side.\n“Italians have migrated to England, the US or other parts of the world to find job opportunities. Unfortunately, we have exported a lot of criminals too. Mobsters are facing a period of crisis here in Sicily. Some of them packed their bags and headed to Villingen or Stuttgart. And they did find a job there, a criminal and very profitable one.’’\nPetra Reski, a journalist who has written a book about the mafia’s growing influence in Germany, said the country now had the highest mafia presence in Europe after Italy. “They are looking for safe investment opportunities that allow them to launder money, so inevitably they get drawn drawn to the wealthier parts of Europe, and in particular areas where there are already people and business with connections back to Italy.”\nBaden-Württemberg is home to a large Italian community who arrived in Germany as part of the country’s guest worker programme in the 1950s, 60s and 70s.\nIn recent years, police have begun to make slow progress in uncovering mafia networks in the Rhineland region, as well as former East German state Thuringia. In March this year, Italian authorities arrested an alleged member of Calabria’s ‘Ndrangheta, now considered the most powerful mafia group, in connection with a 2007 massacre in Duisburg that left six people dead.\n In January 2013, 17 people from Germany and Sicily were arrested at a Cologne bar on suspicion of involvement in a tax evasion scheme linked to mafia groups.\nA 2015 investigation revealed that the ‘Ndrangheta had started to use the city of Erfurt as a hub for money-laundering operations worth up to €100m, stretching across 20 companies and 30 restaurants in German cities including Leipzig, Dresden, Baden-Baden, Kassel, Munich and Münster.\n",

        "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/30/facebook-russia-fake-accounts-126-million",
        "text": "\nRussia-backed content reached as many as 126 million Americans on Facebook during and after the 2016 presidential election, according to the company’s prepared testimony submitted to the Senate judiciary committee before hearings this week.\nFacebook believes 120 fake Russian-backed pages created 80,000 posts that were received by 29 million Americans directly, but reached a much bigger audience by users sharing, liking and following the posts. \nThe social network plans to disclose these numbers to the Senate judiciary committee on Tuesday, according to someone familiar with the testimony.\nThe tech giant’s testimony will follow dramatic developments in the investigation into Russian interference in the election by the special counsel, Robert Mueller, with three indictments, including two top Trump campaign aides.\nIn a day of rapid and surprising developments in Washington on Monday, George Papadopolous, the former foreign policy adviser, was revealed to have pleaded guilty earlier this month to lying to FBI investigators over his contacts last year with two people with apparently close ties to the Russian government.\nMeanwhile, Trump’s former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, and a business associate, Rick Gates, pleaded not guilty to an indictment for money laundering, tax evasion, failure to register as agents for foreign interests and conspiracy to defraud the US government.\nAfter appearing before the judiciary committee on Tuesday, representatives for Facebook, Google and Twitter will testify before the Senate and House intelligence committees in back-to-back public hearings on Wednesday. Both intelligence panels are conducting separate inquiries into Russian meddling in the US election.\n\n\n\n\nSilicon Valley helped Russia sway the US election. So now what? | Emily Bell\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColin Stretch, a lawyer for Facebook, will explain on Tuesday that Russia’s Internet Research Agency posted the material between 2015 and 2017. The posts spread widely, although many of those 126 million people may not have actually seen the material.\nAlthough 126 million people is equivalent to about half of Americans eligible to vote, Facebook plans to downplay the significance at the congressional hearings. \n“Our best estimate is that approximately 126 million people may have been served one of their stories at some point during the two-year period. This equals about four-thousandths of 1% (0.004%) of content in news feed, or approximately one out of 23,000 pieces of content,” Stretch says in his written testimony, obtained by several news outlets.\nThe discovery of Russian interference has, according to Stretch’s testimony, “opened a new battleground for our company, our industry and our society”.\nFacebook closed the accounts and reported malicious actors tied to Russia to US law enforcement.\nSuch “organic” posts are distinct from more than 3,000 advertisements also linked to the agency. These ads, disclosed in early October, were viewed by up to 10 million Facebook users. Twitter and Google found similar activity on their own platforms.\nElliot Schrage, Facebook’s vice-president of policy and communications, said on 2 October that the advertisements appeared to focus on “divisive social and political messages across the ideological spectrum, touching on topics from LGBT matters to race issues to immigration to gun rights”.\nTwitter and Google have also submitted testimony to US lawmakers. \nGoogle, which has not previously commented on its internal investigation, said it had discovered $4,700 (£3,557) worth of ads with suspicious Russian ties as well as 18 YouTube channels linked to the Kremlin’s disinformation campaign. It also discovered Gmail addresses used to open accounts on other platforms.\nTwitter has found 2,752 accounts linked to Russian operatives – more than 10 times greater than it had previously informed lawmakers. \nFacebook and Twitter, though not Google, have publicly outlined steps they are taking to give the public more information about who buys and who sees political advertising on their site. The transparency initiatives are meant to bring the companies more in line with what is required of print and TV advertisers. \nTheir actions appear to pre-empt regulation. A bill unveiled earlier this month would require social media companies to keep public files of election ads and require companies to “make reasonable efforts” to make sure that foreign individuals or entities are not purchasing political advertisements in order to influence Americans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg. The company has pledged to make political advertising more transparent. Photograph: Manu Fernandez/AP\n\n\nIn April, Facebook publicly acknowledged for the first time that its platform had been exploited by governments seeking to manipulate public opinion in other countries, including during the presidential elections in the US and France. \nThe company described such tactics as “information operations” in a white paper authored by the company’s security team, detailing well-funded and subtle techniques used by countries to spread misleading information and falsehoods in aid of geopolitical goals. \nAt the time, Facebook did not attribute the manipulation to any country, although it said that the company’s investigation “does not contradict” the findings of a January report by the US director of national intelligence that outlined Russian involvement in the election.\nFacebook’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, had previously dismissed the notion that the social network had an impact on the presidential race, describing it as a “pretty crazy idea” and saying that voters “make decisions based on their lived experience”. \nIn September, Zuckerberg expressed remorse for his earlier statements.\n“After the election, I made a comment that I thought the idea misinformation on Facebook changed the outcome of the election was a crazy idea. Calling that crazy was dismissive and I regret it,” the founder wrote. “This is too important an issue to be dismissive.”\n\n\n\n\nRussia inquiry charges: how close does this get to Trump?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Monday, a federal grand jury indicted Paul Manafort, Trump’s former campaign chairman, and his longtime business associate Rick Gates, on 12 charges that included conspiring against the US and money laundering.\nIn addition, George Papadopoulos, a former foreign policy adviser to Trump’s campaign, pleaded guilty to perjury over his contacts with Russians linked to the Kremlin.\nAccording to court documents unsealed on Monday, Papadopoulos lied to the FBI about communications with an unnamed professor – identified by the Washington Post as Joseph Mifsud – who offered “dirt” on Hillary Clinton in the form of “thousands of emails”. Another of his contacts was a woman who described herself as “Putin’s niece”.\nManafort and Gates, who both pleaded not guilty in a federal courtroom in Washington on Monday, have also been charged with being unregistered foreign agents and failing to disclose lobbying on behalf of foreign governments that resulted in more than $75m flowing through offshore accounts.\nBoth men were placed under house arrest by a federal judge, who set bail at $10m for Manafort and $5m for Gates.\nAgencies contributed to this report\n",

        "text": "\nThe Commonwealth Bank’s first climate policy statement has been criticised by environmental groups and sparked one group to lodge a shareholder resolution to force the company to implement its stated commitment to the Paris agreement.\nThe bank released the statement, saying it was “reaffirming our support for a responsible global transition to a net zero emissions economy by 2050”.\nIt comes as the bank faces court action from two shareholders, suing it over allegedly inadequate climate-risk disclosure, and just days after it announced it would not be lending to Adani’s Carmichael coalmine. Adani said the statement simply reflected its own decision not to approach any Australian bank.\n\n\n\n\nCarmichael coalmine: Commonwealth Bank indicates it will not lend to Adani\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe short climate statement released by the bank follows a sustained campaign from environmental groups, who have attacked the bank over its previous failure to rule out financing the Adani coalmine, and its status as the country’s biggest lender to Australia’s fossil fuel industry in 2016.\nThe bank announced it would decrease the greenhouse gas pollution caused by its lending, as well as by its own business activity, but it didn’t provide details of how it would do so, or provide targets.\nThe Commonwealth Bank also committed to adopting the recommendations of the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, which means it will begin reporting all its direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions, and include it in its financial filings, meaning they will be fully audited.\n“Commonwealth Bank is not even pretending to make an effort on climate change with the position statement released today,” said Julien Vincent, the executive director of the environmental campaign group Market Forces.\nHe said they would lodge a shareholder resolution against the Commonwealth Bank on Wednesday, which would embed in the bank’s constitution its stated commitment to keeping global warming at less than 2C and force it to implement that commitment in the bank’s management.\n“Unlike the bank’s peers in Australia and overseas that are taking concrete steps to avoid the most carbon intensive sectors, Commonwealth Bank clearly lacks either the interest or competency to fulfil its commitment to help hold global warming below two degrees,” Vincent said.\nVincent said the climate statement would allow the Commonwealth Bank to assist the fossil fuel industry to expand in Australia.\nUnlike some recent announcements by other big four banks in Australia, the Commonwealth Bank did not put any limits on the sort of coal projects or coal-fired power stations the bank might lend to, making them the only one of the “big four” banks to not put some restrictions on lending to coal.\n“We can’t allow a situation to continue where Australia’s biggest company continues to finance a massive fossil fuel industry expansion while feigning interest in a safe climate future,” Vincent said. “That’s why we’re moving a resolution that would embed climate change risk management into the heart of Commonwealth Bank.”\nThe bank’s statement said it would finance $15bn of “low carbon” projects by 2025. Despite being Australia’s biggest bank, that puts it significantly behind some of its competitors, and behind all of them on a pro-rata basis, Vincent said.\n\n\n\n\nPhilip Lowe lashes Commonwealth Bank amid money laundering charges\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVincent said he did not expect the bank to immediately release a policy that was consistent with its stated commitment to limiting global warming at less than 2C. \n“We know it would take a couple of iterations,” Vincent said. But he was surprised that they were so far behind the other big four banks.\nKylie Macfarlane, Commonwealth Bank’s general manager of corporate responsibility, said the transition to net zero emissions by 2050 is a major priority for the bank, which will be overseen by the board.\n“Our climate commitment represents a real statement of intent and provides us with a framework that will help us define the role we play in keeping global warming to well below two degrees in line with the Paris agreement,” she said. “This is our first climate policy position statement, and it will iterate over time. The scenario analysis will ensure that our decisions are grounded in science and economics.”\nBlair Palese, the chief executive of 350.org Australia, said the bank’s statement was a step back from what they were led to believe would be released in earlier discussions.\n“It’s worse than what was discussed with environmental groups previously and far less than the commitment of other banks,” Palese said. “There are no specific commitments to reducing or phasing out coal or fossil fuels more generally at a time [when] that is what Australia needs from banks and investors. Overall, a fail on their part to show leadership.”\nGreenpeace said the statement “will do nothing to restore the bank’s tattered reputation”.\n“A climate policy that doesn’t mention coal or fossil fuels is not a climate policy at all,” Greenpeace campaigner Jonathan Moylan said. “The Commonwealth Bank commit in their policy to support a transition to net zero emissions by 2050 but then make a mockery of that promise by failing to outline any significant measures to achieve that goal.”\n",

        "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/19/british-banks-trusted-nationalise-city-profits-communities",
        "text": "\nSometimes the case for a policy is as overwhelming as the level of ridicule it will get from the punditocracy. The nationalisation of Britain’s failed banking industry – the sector responsible for most of our country’s current ills – is one such example. According to a recent poll, half the electorate support nationalising the banks, despite almost no one arguing for such a policy in public life.\nIt may well be because the banks plunged Britain into one of its worst economic crises in modern history, spawning, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, perhaps our worst squeeze in living standards since the 1750s. The fact that they have been bailed out by the taxpayer but allowed to carry on as though little happened – including more top British bankers in 2013 being gifted bonuses worth over €1m than all EU countries combined – while public services are gratuitously slashed, has rightly riled some British voters.\n\n\n\n\nLabour demands review into City of London role in money-laundering\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNationalisation of the banks is not about vengeance, though. Sure, the rip-off inefficiency of rail privatisation, or the failure of the great energy sell-off, or the fact that even the Financial Times has argued that privately run water is an indefensible debacle – all are testament to the intellectual poverty of the “private good, public bad” argument. None quite compete, however, with the matter of the banks leaving the entire western world consumed with the gravest series of crises since the second world war.\nWould Brexit, Donald Trump, or the gathering demands for Catalonia to secede from crisis-ridden Spain have happened without the financial collapse? Almost certainly not. It is now somewhat darkly comic to note that most commentators and politicians claimed Labour lost the 2015 election because it was too leftwing. It is notable, then, that over four in 10 voters back then believed Labour was too soft on banks and big business, compared to just over one in five who differed.\nEconomist Laurie Macfarlane says the banks make a mockery of the nostrums of free-market capitalism. Because the banks were given state bailouts after their catastrophic failures, there is the assumption that, when another crisis hits, the same will happen again.\nNo other industry enjoys the same protection. They are “too big to fail”, which means they benefit from an implicit subsidy – worth £6bn in 2015. The Bank of England is their lender of last resort. State-backed deposit insurance of up to £85,000 per consumer is another de facto mass public subsidy.\nAs the New Economics Foundation says, it is commercial banks who are now responsible for creating the vast majority of money in economies like the UK, a source of vast profit. This is called “seigniorage” and – as the foundation puts it – it represents a “hidden annual subsidy” of £23bn a year, or nearly three-quarters of the banks’ after-tax profits. And banks are an essential public utility: it is almost impossible to be a citizen without a bank account, and there is no public option when it comes to making electronic payments.\nEven now, as Macfarlane notes, the British state technically owns a fifth of the retail banking industry because of its stake in Royal Bank of Scotland. Repeated RBS scandals, and the aftermath of the EU referendum result, have dented the worth of the company’s shares, meaning that the state selling its stake would result in eye-watering losses. Meanwhile, small businesses have struggled to get the credit they need, and escalating household debt threatens the foundations of the stagnating British economy. But the state’s arms-length approach means RBS has failed both its customers and the broader economy. A profit-driven banking sector closed 1,150 branches in 2014 and 2015; about a third of those were owned by RBS. The bank once promised never to close the last branch in town; the pledge was broken, and 1,500 communities have been left with no bank branch. Vulnerable customers and small businesses inevitably suffer the most.\n\n\n \n\n\nPlay Video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1:36\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Corbyn takes swipe at chancellor in PMQs – video\n\n\nBy contrast, foreign publicly owned banks are self-evident successes. Take Germany: KFW, the government-owned development bank, is crucial in developing national infrastructure as well as the renewable energy revolution. On a regional level, state-owned Landesbanken are responsible for industrial strategy. Then at the most local level, there are Sparkassen: they focus on developing relationships with local businesses and consumers. They’re not beholden to shareholders – instead, they have a stakeholder model, focused on helping local economies – indeed, their capital has to remain in local communities.\nIt is impossible to understand Britain’s current plight without examining the country’s rapid deindustrialisation in favour of a financial sector concentrated in London and the south-east. And according to New Economics Foundation, while foreign stakeholder banks lend two thirds of their assets to individuals and businesses in the real economy, that’s true with only a tiny proportion of British shareholder banks. Overwhelmingly, it goes to mortgage lending and lending to other financial institutions.\nOur current banking system is rigged in favour of a crisis-ridden City. The New Economics Foundation suggests transforming RBS – in which the state still has a three-quarter share – into a network of local banks. Labour’s 2017 manifesto backed a review into these plans. A management board would run the network day to day, but a board of trustees would ensure the bank was accountable to the broader economy and customers, not shareholders.\nA third would be elected by workers, a third by local authorities and a third by local stakeholders. The mandate of each local bank would be to promote local economies – not least their small businesses – rather than the City of London. Here is a model of democratic ownership that can, in time, be extended to the rest of the economy.\n\n\n\n\nHalf of UK adults are financially vulnerable, City watchdog finds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan it really be argued that private ownership of the banks is a case study of the glorious success of free market capitalism? The principle architect of Labour’s recent manifesto, Andrew Fisher, called for the nationalisation of Britain’s banking sector in his 2014 book The Failed Experiment: And How to Build an Economy That Works. He was surely right then and he is right now. As Macfarlane notes, there are different possible routes to the banks’ nationalisation: whether it be swapping corporate shares for government bonds, using quantitative easing to buy up shares, or simple nationalisation without compensation. Labour is right to call for a German-style public investment bank, backed up by similar publicly run local banks.\nBut such proposals are not in themselves sufficient. Britain’s privately run banks have proved a disaster for everyone except their shareholders. The only good alternative is public stakeholder banks, run by workers, consumers and local authorities, with an obligation to defend the best interests of our communities. Privately owned banks have proved a catastrophic failure – for our economy, our social cohesion and our politics. There is surely no alternative to public ownership.\n• Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist\n",

        "text": "\nGreyhound trainers continued to give their dogs arsenic, cocaine and cobalt in the eight months after the New South Wales government reversed its ban.\nTwenty trainers have been charged and convicted of offences involving prohibited substances by Greyhound Racing NSW since mid-October, stewards reports show. Their punishments have ranged from small fines of $625 to 12-month suspensions.\nIn one case, trainer Sonia Kempshall was fined $750 after three of her dogs were found with arsenic in their system. Those dogs have collectively won more than $60,000 in prize money. \n\n\n\n\nGreyhound racing: euthanasia of healthy dogs sparks call for stronger penalties\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn another, trainer Jeanette Foley was disqualified for 12 months after her greyhound was found with amphetamine and benzoylecgonine in its system.\nOther dogs were found with flunixin, a banned anti-inflammatory, caffeine, lignocaine, anti-insomnia medication and dexamethasone.\nThe Greens MLC Mehreen Faruqi said the cases showed the industry’s commitment to reform was simply “lip service”.\n“One thing we can be sure of with the overturning of the ban is that dogs will continue be drugged, they will continue to die on track and they will continue to be killed when they no longer run fast enough to make money,” Faruqi said. “The backflip on the greyhound racing ban has emboldened people in the industry to continue to do the wrong thing.”\nFaruqi is also concerned at the leniency of the punishments for prohibited substances. She described some of the lesser fines as “so woefully small that they are meaningless”.\nThe NSW government is still progressing with reforms to the industry, which it announced while reversing its decision on the controversial ban. \nIt is creating an independent Greyhound Welfare and Integrity Commission and last month began searching for a chief commissioner and two commissioners for the body. \n\n\n\n\nTAB fined $45m for breach of money-laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government is also reconstituting the Greyhound Racing NSW board and will transfer its regulatory and welfare functions to the new independent integrity commission.\n“The creation of the independent commission is a key part of the reformed greyhound industry structure,” the racing minister, Paul Toole, said last month. “Separating regulatory and commercial functions will improve governance, transparency and accountability.”\nDebate over the future of greyhound racing has also arisen in Victoria. The state government is considering changes that would significantly tighten regulation on the racing industry. \nThe government has given a draft greyhound code of practice to the industry, which recommends stricter requirements on housing, exercise, socialisation, mental stimulation, breeding, rearing, racing, training and retirement. \nThe document is designed to stipulate the minimum standard of care required for dogs over their life. \nIt was developed as part of the state government’s response to the racing integrity commissioner’s report into live baiting and the chief veterinary officer’s report on animal welfare. \nThe industry is concerned the changes will drive up costs and force some out of the industry.\n",

        "text": "\nBitcoin is a digital currency started in 2009 by a mystery figure named Satoshi Nakamoto, whose true identity is still unknown. It is unlike traditional currencies because it has no central bank, nation state or regulatory authority backing it up.\nThe “coins” are made by computers solving a set of complex maths problems. To spend them, users buy bitcoin and conduct transactions with them using exchanges such as San Francisco-based Coinbase. Rather than a central authority validating transactions, they are all recorded on a public ledger, called the blockchain.\nBitcoin don’t actually exist but are digital keys are stored in a digital wallet, which can also manage transactions. The wallet exists either in the cloud or on computers, and can be linked to bank accounts. If using an online wallet, investors must be sure they can trust the provider, because if hackers breach its server’s security measures the bitcoin could be stolen.\nTypically, you can pay by bank transfer, mobile payments or with a Visa or Mastercard. There are also bitcoin ATMs, which allow for bitcoin to be exchanged for cash and vice versa, in London, Bristol, Brighton and Glasgow. A growing list of firms accept Bitcoin, including Tesla and Microsoft. \n\n\n\n\nBitcoin is a fraud that will blow up, says JP Morgan boss\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBitcoin has a finite supply of 21m – of which more than 15m are in circulation – which supporters claim make it more stable than government-backed currencies that can be devalued by central banks printing money. However, it has been very volatile and has quadrupled in value in the last nine months to more than $5,000 for each bitcoin. It lost 10% on Wednesday when Jamie Dimon of JP Morgan described it as a fraud.\nBitcoin is often used as an anonymous way to carry out large cross-border money transfers, so has become linked to drug dealing and money laundering. It was used on the online black market site Silk Road, a platform for selling illegal drugs.\n On exchanges, fractions or “bits” can be bought instead of a whole bitcoin. Transaction fees vary according to the exchange or broker, but are typically up to 1% of the currency bought, plus bank transaction charges. Fees of up to 1% can also apply on sales.\n",

Not only has the price of Bitcoins soared above $15,000, repeatedly recovering from sharp drops along the way, but financial markets are now treating Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as legitimate financial assets.

While the price of Bitcoin has surged, its use as a currency has stagnated, or even declined.\nAt the core of the cryptocurrency proposition is the idea of the blockchain, a distributed ledger in which updates are made by a consensus of a large number of independent contributors. In the case of Bitcoin, two kinds of updates are needed. New bitcoins are created by “proof of work”, that is the production of an easily verified solution to a complex mathematical problem. The energy used in this process, and the fact that the work done in the calculations is of no value in itself, have been the subject of much criticism.\nThe other kind of updates to the ledger, those that make it work as a currency, take place when Bitcoins are transferred from one person to another in exchange for goods and services. The blockchain ensures that these transactions can be verified, even though there is no central authority keeping track of them and no physical evidence of their occurrence.\nThe problem is that the mining tail is wagging the Bitcoin dog. So much effort is going in to the profitable activity of mining bitcoins that the system is dominated by these updates. As a result, using Bitcoins for their intended purpose as a currency is slow and costly. A Bitcoin transaction can take hours, or even days, to be confirmed and a typical fee is as much as $7. \nRecently the gaming platform Steam announced that, because of these fees, and the volatility of the currency, bitcoins would no longer be accepted as payment. This is a striking instance of a much bigger problem. Nearly a decade after its introduction, and with nearly $100bn in market capitalisation, a list of all legitimate merchants willing to accept Bitcoin fits comfortably on a single web page.\nIf, for example, you would like to use Bitcoin to buy a beer, your options are limited to two venues, one in London and one in Sydney. An Australian vendor recently made headline news by offering to accept Bitcoin as payment for his house. To put it bluntly, a merchant accepting payment in Bitcoins is not making a business decision but staging a publicity stunt.\nOf course, much of the appeal of Bitcoin is that it can be used for transactions where secrecy is desired, including drug deals and money laundering. The recent upsurge in the price of Bitcoin reflects its massive popularity in China, where people have lots of reasons to seek to hide transactions from the authorities. But that in turn creates a vulnerability. \nOver 80% of all Bitcoin mining takes place in China, much of it organised in a relatively small number of “pools”. If the Chinese government took control of these pools, it would control the entire ledger and could change it in any way it wanted. Of course, that would require willingness to undertake large scale seizures of computers and the use of force to compel co-operation. But the Chinese government has ample force at its disposal, and a demonstrated willingness to use it against any perceived threat.\n\n\n\n\nA bubble? We don’t even know how to value Bitcoin | Alicia (Lucy) Cameron and Kelly Trinh\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, a bet on Bitcoin involves a lot of faith in the continued tolerance of the Chinese government for a currency with a professed objective of undermining existing states.\nLike most financial bubbles, Bitcoin begins with a claim to have invented a new way of doing business. If people lose faith in that claim, the entire edifice is merely a record of some pointless calculations. At the moment, there’s little evidence to support the idea that Bitcoin will ever become a usable currency.\n• John Quiggin is an economist at the University of Queensland\n",

        "text": "\n“It’s bigger than Watergate.” “It’s a transparent sham.” “It’s a constitutional crisis.” “It’s a legal cliffhanger.”\nWhatever else it may be, the story of Donald Trump and Russia comes down to this: a sitting president or his campaign is suspected of having coordinated with a foreign country to manipulate a US election. Trump strongly denies all wrongdoing and calls the inquiry a “witch hunt”. But prosecutors see red flags everywhere.\nThe story could not be bigger, and the stakes for Trump – and the country – could not be higher.\nInvestigators are asking two basic questions: did Trump’s presidential campaign collude at any level with Russian operatives to sway the 2016 US presidential election? And did Trump or others break the law to throw investigators off the trail?\nThe revelation Monday that a former Trump foreign policy adviser, George Papadopoulos, was informed in April 2016 by a Russian contact that Moscow had obtained “thousands of emails” containing “dirt” on Hillary Clinton has made the question of collusion more urgent. Prosecutors are investigating how far the discussion between the two sides of “dirt” on Clinton went, and what, if any, action was taken. \nSeparately Monday, former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort turned himself in to federal authorities to face charges including conspiracy against the United States, tax evasion and money laundering. Beginning in 2005, Manafort worked as a political consultant and business partner with Russian oligarchs and Kremlin-linked politicians in Ukraine, as did his colleague Richard Gates III, who was also indicted on Monday.\n\n\n \n\n\nPlay Video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n0:32\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Paul Manafort seen entering FBI field office in Washington DC – video\n\n\nManafort joined the Trump campaign in March 2016 and resigned in August after his ties to Kremlin-linked figures came under increasing scrutiny. \nThe charges against Manafort are separate from but related to the allegations of “collusion” between the Trump campaign writ large and Russian operatives. The presence at the top of the campaign of a suspect accused of working in secret for a foreign government, and of hiding money in offshore accounts to avoid tax payments, places the campaign uncomfortably close to Kremlin interests.\nBut the charges against Manafort and Gates do not mention any attempted manipulation of the 2016 election. Though Manafort personally offered “private briefings” on the election to the Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska in July 2016, Trump has denied any knowledge of Manafort’s dealings in the former Soviet bloc and has defended Manafort as a “very decent man”.\nWhile a majority of the American public now believes that Russia tried to disrupt the US election, opinions about Trump campaign involvement tend to split along partisan lines: 73% of Republicans, but only 13% of Democrats, believe Trump did “nothing wrong” in his dealings with Russia and its president, Vladimir Putin.\nThe affair has the potential to eject Trump from office. Experienced legal observers believe that prosecutors are investigating whether Trump committed an obstruction of justice. Both Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton – the only presidents to face impeachment proceedings in the last century – were accused of obstruction of justice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Trump’s firing of the FBI director James Comey, shown here on 8 June 2017 as he testified before the Senate select committee on intelligence, could be an obstruction of justice. Photograph: J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n\n\nBut Trump’s fate is probably up to the voters. Even if strong evidence of wrongdoing by him or his cohort emerged, a Republican congressional majority would probably block any action to remove him from office. (Such an action would be a historical rarity.)\nDeepening negative perceptions attached to the Russia affair could, however, be the force that levels Trump, dooming a 2020 re-election bid. Or the president may yet be fully vindicated, re-elected and elevated in the eyes of the people.\nNone of the three congressional committees investigating the matter, nor the special counsel, Robert Mueller, has yet announced any evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian operatives. The investigations have an open timeline. \nHere’s what you need to know:\nWhat are the most serious allegations?\nIt appears that prosecutors are weighing serious charges, including obstruction of justice, against Trump. (Weighing a charge does not mean bringing a charge.) Current and former Trump aides are likewise under intense pressure, a point underscored by the arrest of Paul Manafort and Richard Gates on 30 October and by George Papadopoulos’s guilty plea.\nCollusion. Did Trump or his campaign “collude” with Russia to tip the 2016 election? Such collusion could take many conceivable forms. Investigators might be looking into whether members of Trump’s digital team traded information with Russia-linked hackers about which voters the campaign was most interested in. Or they might be looking for evidence of conversations about the timing of the release of certain hacked materials. Or they could be seeking information about potential hacking targets. (No evidence has yet emerged of any of the above; Trump and his aides have denied all wrongdoing.)\nObstruction of justice. Has Trump gotten in the way of law enforcement efforts to figure out what happened? Investigators might be looking into whether Trump intended, by firing the FBI director James Comey on 9 May 2017, to pull the plug on the Russia investigation. Trump seems to have admitted as much. “I just fired the head of the FBI,” Trump reportedly told Russians in the Oval Office the next day. “He was crazy, a real nut job. I faced great pressure because of Russia. That’s taken off.” \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Trump jokes with the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, and the Russian ambassador to the US, Sergey Kislyak, during a meeting at the White House, a day after firing the FBI director James Comey. Photograph: HO/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\nBut Trump’s frame of mind is crucial in weighing a potential obstruction charge, and he has offered alternative explanations for the firing of Comey, including that Comey was mismanaging the FBI. To discern Trump’s intent, investigators are probably focusing on an initial letter to fire Comey drafted by Trump but rejected by the White House counsel. That letter has not yet been made public.\nAbuse of power. Trump may have committed offenses that relate specifically to the office of the presidency, such as a violation of the oath of office (to uphold the constitution), or an abuse of power, which might, for example involve, firing Comey out of personal pique at Comey’s refusal publicly to say that Trump was not personally a target of the Russia investigation. \nWe don’t for the moment know, however, what exactly the investigators – three congressional committees plus the special counsel – are investigating. The official order appointing Robert Mueller authorizes him to investigate “any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump” and related matters. Mueller is authorized to prosecute federal crimes. \nCurrent and former aides. Trump aides are thought to face potential charges including money laundering, making false statements, failure to register as foreign agents, campaign finance violations and more. In May, the former national security adviser Michael Flynn invoked constitutional protections against self-incrimination to avoid testifying before a Senate committee. Paul Manafort was arrested on 30 October on money laundering, tax evasion and conspiracy charges. On the same day it was revealed that foreign policy adviser had pleaded guilty to making false statements to the FBI. Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner stood outside the White House that month and said: “I did not collude.” The former campaign aides Carter Page and Roger Stone have both been questioned by investigators and asked to turn over documents and records. The attorney general, Jeff Sessions, has defended himself against accusations of making misleading statements to Congress. All these men – Flynn, Manafort, Kushner, Page, Stone and Sessions – have denied wrongdoing.\nHow much trouble is Trump in?\nCongress. The short answer to this question is another question: who controls Congress? As long as Republicans are in charge, Trump is not likely to face impeachment proceedings or to be removed from office. A two-thirds majority in the Senate is required to remove a president from office through impeachment. Before such action, a simple House majority would be required to pass articles of impeachment. \nPublic opinion. If public opinion swings precipitously against the president, however, his grip on power could slip. At some point, Republicans in Congress may, if their constituents will it, turn on Trump.\nCriminal charges. Apart from impeachment, Trump could, perhaps, face criminal charges, which would (theoretically) play out in the court system as opposed to Congress. Mueller has the power to file criminal charges against Trump, but it’s a matter of debate among scholars and prosecutors whether Trump, as a sitting president, may be prosecuted. It’s never been tried before.\nLosing re-election. The most likely price Trump would pay, if he were perceived as guilty of wrongdoing, would be a 2020 re-election loss. Every president to win re-election since the second world war did so with an approval rating in the 49% or 50% range or better. Trump’s average approval rating is in the mid-to-upper 30s. The number could slide even further if, for example, one of his former aides or cabinet members is indicted on money laundering charges. \nIs this a ‘witch hunt’ as Trump claims?\n“You are witnessing the single greatest WITCH HUNT in American political history – led by some very bad and conflicted people! #MAGA” Trump tweeted in June. Elsewhere, Trump has decried what he says are the wasteful costs of investigating the case.\n\n\nDonald J. Trump \n(@realDonaldTrump)\nYou are witnessing the single greatest WITCH HUNT in American political history - led by some very bad and conflicted people! #MAGA\n\nJune 15, 2017\n\n\nThose assertions would seem to be undercut by developments such as the arrest of Manafort and Papadopoulos’s guilty plea. But many factors go into judging the value of the investigation.\nPartisan split. Are the president and his team the victims of a witch-hunt? Your answer to the question probably depends on your political affiliation. \nSeventy-three per cent of registered Republicans think Trump did “nothing wrong” in his dealings with Russia and Putin, according to a Marist poll in July. But only a 36% minority of US adults overall think Trump did “nothing wrong”, the poll found. Forty-one per cent of Democrats said they thought Trump had done “something illegal” and 59% said Trump’s campaign associates had broken the law.\nRecord of conduct. Apart from public opinion, what do we have to go on? A record of conduct by Trump and his aides going back decades, which is defined by secrecy and denials. \nTrump has denied his past links to Russian investors and partners and a long history of attempted business deals in Russia, while praising Putin. Trump aides denied the occurrence of meetings and conversations with Russian operatives that came to light anyway. When a June 2016 Trump Tower meeting was revealed, Trump misled the public as to its purpose. His tax returns, which could reveal previously undisclosed financial relationships, remain sealed to the public.\nFaith in the rule of law. Is this a witch-hunt? A negative reply relies on a faith in the rule of law in the United States. \nHave investigators proceeded logically, in response to a reasonable suspicion of wrongdoing, and in accordance with congressional and justice department guidelines? \nRepublicans in Congress have given the allegations against the Trump campaign sufficient credence to advance investigations in three committees. Trump’s own justice department saw fit to take the step of appointing Mueller. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Robert Mueller took over the high-stakes Russia probe in May after US President Donald Trump fired James Comey as FBI director. Photograph: Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\nMueller, who was named FBI director by George W Bush and held over by Barack Obama, enjoys a reputation for integrity among officials on both sides of the aisle. Trump has said Mueller “is very, very good friends with [James] Comey, which is very bothersome” but also said “Robert Mueller is an honorable man”. Mueller’s critics have accused his operation of having a partisan tilt based on past campaign donations to Clinton and Obama made by at least five legal team members. But others have argued the donations are neither unusual nor evidence of anti-Trump bias. \nA pattern of attacks. Trump’s witch-hunt accusation is not his first attack on the rule of law. He branded Comey a liar and said the FBI was a “mess”. He has attacked judges and courts after rulings he did not like on immigration policy or his proposed travel ban. He publicly criticized the attorney general for a decision he did not agree with. As president, Trump has displayed a unique tendency to make baseless attacks on the justice department. But also as president, he has a unique ability to amplify those attacks and to make them devastatingly effective, eroding faith in the process.\nA pattern of obstruction? Trump’s tendency to attack the process may ultimately backfire. Legal scholars have warned that Trump’s attacks on the special counsel investigation and justice department could amount to obstruction of justice by the president. \nIf Trump’s lawyers have warned him to stop tampering with the process, however, he has not heeded that advice. On 27 October, Trump tweeted: “It is now commonly agreed, after many months of COSTLY looking, that there was NO collusion between Russia and Trump.” \nThat wasn’t true, and it could be seen as an attempt to influence the outcome of the case. Later the same day, reports emerged that the first charges in the case had been filed. And just three weeks earlier, the Republican chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, Richard Burr, said: “The issue of collusion is still open.” \n",

        "text": "\nLegislators in Peru have begun impeachment proceedings against Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, who is accused of failing to disclose decade-old payments from the Brazilian construction firm Odebrecht, which has been embroiled in Latin America’s biggest corruption scandal. \nRepresentatives of most political parties agreed on Friday to initiate proceedings to force out the president, who has denied any wrongdoing and rejected calls to stand down.\nKuczynski, 79, is the latest high-ranking politician to be caught up in the wide-ranging scandal, a vast web of political and corporate corruption which began in Brazil and has spread across 12 countries in Latin America. Odebrecht admitted paying some $800m in bribes across the region in 2016 plea bargain with the US justice department. \n\n\n\n\nBrazil’s corruption scandal spreads across South America\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“I’m not running and I’m not hiding because I have no reason to,” Kuczynski said in a defiant address to the nation just before midnight on Thursday. “I’m not going to abdicate my honor, my values or my responsibilities as president of all Peruvians.”\nFlanked by his cabinet, the former World Bank official pledged to produce his personal banking records. He denied allegations of a conflict of interest, saying he did not have a management role in Westfield Capital, a US-based consulting firm, between 2004 and 2007, when it received $782,000 from consortiums led by Odebrecht. \nDuring much of the time he served as finance and prime minister in the government of Alejandro Toledo (2001-2006). He said the payments were for contracts signed by his business partner.\nKuczynski’s impassioned address ended a 24-hour period of political turbulence that started on Wednesday when opposition lawmakers presented documents provided by Odebrecht showing payments to Westfield as well as $4m to another firm, First Capital, owned by the same business partner.\nKuczynski decried “systematic corruption” which threatened his government and the democratic order. He concluded “it cost us a lot to recover this democracy. Let’s not lose it again”, in what seemed to be a veiled reference to the authoritarian government of jailed former president Alberto Fujimori (1990-2000) – whose daughter Keiko Fujimori leads Fuerza Popular, the majority opposition party, which is leading the push for to impeach him.\nKuczsynki’s defiant stance, however, has failed to convince even those who supported him in the 2016 election campaign in which he vowed to fight corruption and streamline the economy\nGustavo Gorriti, a Peruvian journalist investigating the Odebrecht scandal, said: “The president has worn down the truth repeatedly.”\n“The information indicates there were consultancies and services for Odebrecht during many years and for a large amount of money, almost $5m,” he said. “At least one of those payments was made when he was a government minister,” he adds. \nAccusations of corruption have tainted the last three presidents of Peru. Toledo, who governed Peru from 2001 to 2006, is in the United States and is fighting extradition to Peru on charges he received $20m in bribes from Odebrecht. \nIn July, former Peruvian president Ollanta Humala and his wife Nadine Heredia were put into pre-trial detention pending the preparation of money laundering charges linked to campaign donations made by the company.\nThe former president Alan Garcia is also under investigation for receiving bribes along with the main opposition leader Fujimori and the former mayor of Lima, Susana Villaran.\n",

        "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/17/the-situation-is-desperate-murdered-maltese-journalists-daphne-caruana-galizia-final-words",
        "text": "\nIn her last blogpost, published the day she died, Daphne Caruana Galizia signed off with a sentence that seems particularly chilling now.\n“There are crooks everywhere you look. The situation is desperate.”\nCaruana Galizia, 53, felt she had good reason to feel pessimistic about Malta, and her enemies had good reason to fear her. Someone, it seems, was worried enough to want her silenced.\nIn that last post, which appeared just before a bomb blew up the car she was driving, Caruana Galizia had taken aim, and not for the first time, at Maltese politicians. But they were far from the only people in the firing line.\n\n\n\n\nMurdered Panama Papers journalist's son attacks Malta's 'crooks'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShe believed, in essence, that malign and criminal interests had captured Malta and turned it into an island mafia state; she reported on a political system rife with corruption, businesses seemingly used to launder money or pay bribes, and a criminal justice system that seemed incapable, or unwilling, to take on the controlling minds behind it all.\nProof of her fears included the 15 mafia-style assassinations and car bombings that have taken place on the island in the last 10 years – and, ultimately, perhaps, her own murder too.\nThough there will be many on Malta who will not trust the police to properly investigate her death, including her son, Matthew, detectives will be urged to look at what she has written in recent months, and what she had been looking at just before her death – to see what clues, if any, they provide.\n Had this fiercely independent journalist finally got too close to something – or was she proving too much of an irritant to someone?\nCaruana Galizia was certainly used to stirring up trouble.\nThose about whom she has written in the past year range from government ministers to the newly elected leader of the opposition; the characters in her stories included a convicted drug smuggler and a local millionaire who complained after she alleged that he had built a private zoo without planning permission.\nHer style was fearless, witty and sardonic. Her posts – there were lots of them – made uncomfortable reading for those in power. She became the island’s most celebrated reporter and teller of plain truths. \nProbably her greatest achievement over the past year was to spark, more or less singlehandedly, an extraordinary political scandal that has embroiled the island’s prime minister, his closest political allies, and the ruling family of Azerbaijan.\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the Panama Papers? A guide to history's biggest data leak\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt led to Malta’s prime minister, Joseph Muscat, calling a general election in June.\nThe tale is complex; it involves a whistleblower from inside a secretive private bank, alleged kickbacks to senior politicians and a plethora of offshore companies that caused chaos for Muscat, the leader of the ruling Labour party.\nThere is nothing to suggest any of this is linked to her murder – but the episode highlights the courageous way she tackled those in authority, and her doggedness in the face of legal threats.\nCaruana Galizia’s investigation was built on documents uncovered in the Panama Papers, published in April last year. Among the many names of government officials were two Maltese politicians: Keith Schembri, chief of staff to Muscat, and Konrad Mizzi, the country’s energy minister.\nBoth had set up similar structures, involving Panamanian companies owned by New Zealand trusts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  A woman reads a letter to investigative journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia during a silent candlelight vigil to protest against her murder, in St Julian’s, Malta. Photograph: Darrin Zammit Lupi/Reuters\n\n\n The allegation: the trusts were used to receive kickbacks from rich Russians who bought Maltese passports. The publication led to street protests and caused disquiet in Brussels. \nMizzi and Schembri denied any wrongdoing. Mizzi said the accounts had been set up to receive income from a property in London, while Schembri implied that the offshore entities were related to his business activities before entering politics. Both men kept their jobs.\nEarlier this year Caruana Galizia followed up the story with new detail. She alleged the Panama Papers scheme was also connected to Azerbaijan, the oil-rich dictatorship ruled as a personal fiefdom by the Aliyev family.\nThe same month that Mizzi and Schembri began setting up the offshore structures, they visited Azerbaijan, along with the prime minister and his spokesman. \nThe purpose of the visit was to agree a deal on fuel supplies. Unusually, civil servants, diplomats and journalists were not invited.\nAlthough the reports prompted a national protest against corruption, the second in Malta that year, Muscat’s Labour government narrowly defeated a vote of no confidence presented by the opposition Nationalist party.\nOver the coming months, while the initial scandal continued to make headlines, Caruana Galizia’s investigation continued. \nHer focus was a mysterious third company, Egrant. In April 2017, just over a year after the Panama Papers were first published, Caruana Galizia reported that Egrant’s owner was one Michelle Muscat – the wife of Malta’s prime minister.\nFurthermore, she alleged that a €1m (£890,000) payment received by the company originated from Leyla Aliyeva, the daughter of Azerbaijan’s president.\nMuscat’s spokesman has described this as “an outright lie”. \nCaruana Galizia’s report was sourced to a Russian whistleblower from inside a private bank in Malta called Pilatus.\nThe woman, later named as Maria Efimova, told Caruana Galizia that documents referring to the company were held in a safe, which had recently been removed from her boss’s office and moved into the staff kitchen, where there was no CCTV.\n\nmap\n\nAfter Efimova complained that she had not been paid, Pilatus filed a complaint against her for “fraud and misappropriation”. Police seized her passport and charged her.\nEfimova later fled the country after complaining to the prime minister that Russian private detectives had approached her father.\nOn the eve of the election, the story took a further twist. Leaked documents seen by the Guardian revealed that a Maltese intelligence agency, the Financial Investigation and Analysis Unit (FIAU), had in May 2016 concluded there was “reasonable suspicion of money laundering” involving Schembri, and it recommended police investigate further.\nSchembri did not deny the transactions had taken place, but said the money was simply the repayment of a loan he made to a friend. The case is being investigated by a magistrate.\nA second report by the FIAU into the Pilatus Bank alleged it had shown a “glaring, possibly deliberate disregard” for money-laundering controls. Pilatus said it fully adheres to all laws and regulations.\nThe gaming industry was another prime source of concern for Caruana Galizia. Over last decade, Malta has become a global hub for the online betting and gaming industries. The business employs more than 8,000 people on the island and its contribution to the economy is huge.\nRecent estimates suggest the sector is worth €1.2bn, 12% of the island’s GDP.\nYet despite the island’s claim to be a “world class jurisdiction” for online gaming, there have been persistent reports of Italian mafia infiltration – in June, regulators suspended one operation over such fears.\nIn a post from May this year, Caruana Galizia noted: “I don’t know why we should be surprised that organised crime has insinuated its tentacles into the highest echelons of government in Malta, using democracy for the purpose while undermining it thoroughly. If it happened in Italy and eastern Europe, it can happen here, where the institutions of state are so much weaker.”\n\n• This article was amended on 18 October 2017 to correct the mention of an alleged $1m payment received by Egrant – this should have read €1m. \n",

        "date": "2017-12-07T14:56:41Z",
        "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/07/rbs-sir-howard-davies-bitcoin-dantes-inferno-digital-currency",
        "text": "\nBitcoin has been likened to Dante’s Inferno by the chairman of the Royal Bank of Scotland. As the digital currency surged towards $16,000, Sir Howard Davies suggested it should carry a similarly apocalyptic warning for investors.\nDavies, a former head of the UK’s top financial watchdog, called on the Bank of England and other authorities around the world to launch a coordinated warning against the digital currency. \nBitcoin has increased in value by $4,500 in the space of a week, after surging more than 900% this year. It was trading at $15,800 late afternoon on Thursday.\n“Put up the sign from Dante’s Inferno – ‘Abandon hope all ye who enter here’ – I think that’s probably what’s needed,” he said speaking on Bloomberg TV, adding that the cryptocurrency appeared to be a “frothy investment bubble”.\nDavies argued for Threadneedle Street to take action at the same time as the US Federal Reserve, Securities and Exchange Commission, and the European Central Bank. “Central banks are very anxious about it [bitcoin],” he said.\nThe call from Davies follows warnings from other senior figures in the world of finance, including the heads of Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan, as well as the Nobel-prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz – who has argued that the currency should be outlawed. \nDavies also warned major US exchanges against launching trading in bitcoin, just as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange prepares to offer banks and hedge funds the ability to buy and sell derivatives based on the cryptocurrency. Some analysts believe this has the potential to further inflate the price, although it could also lead bitcoin to fall owing to short-selling of the currency. \n“I’m not quite sure that they know enough about what [bitcoin] is,” he said, adding that it would be “a very risky move in reputational terms” for major financial firms to start offering trading in bitcoin.\nThe Financial Times reported on Thursday that some Wall Street banks were pushing back against the launch of bitcoin into the mainstream financial system, warning in a letter to US regulators that the system was ill-prepared. \nEconomists have compared bitcoin’s meteoric rise with past bubbles, such as the tulip mania of the 17th century and the dotcom bubble that began in the late 90s with the Nasdaq index in New York and burst in 2000. The Guardian recently found little evidence of a wider move for the adoption of the digital currency among shops in the technology hub around Old Street in east London.\nThe former Fed chairman Alan Greenspan – who coined the phrase “irrational exuberance” when describing overpriced assets during the dotcom bubble – said on CNBC this week that bitcoin was “not a rational currency”. \nThe Bank of England has made incremental warnings against bitcoin, although Davies said central bankers appeared “nervous about not wanting to be seen to be luddites, saying all of these innovations are bad things”. \nSir Jon Cunliffe, the deputy governor responsible for financial stability, gave brief warnings while speaking to the BBC last week. He said consumers should “do their homework, and think carefully” before buying the currency. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Sir Howard Davies. Photograph: PA\n\n\nBitcoin is not regulated by the Bank or the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which has, however, warned investors in initial coin offerings – sales of digital coins or tokens such as bitcoin used by startups as an alternative to raising money by issuing shares – that they can lose all of their money.\nThe UK and other EU governments are taking steps to introduce greater controls, with the Treasury planning to bring cryptocurrencies into line with anti-money-laundering and counter-terrorism financial rules. \nStill, there have been no public suggestions about giving the FCA or the Bank powers to regulate the new currencies. \nDavies’s warning is likely to raise some eyebrows among bitcoin’s supporters, who view the cryptocurrency as a way of escaping the traditional financial system.\nRBS was bailed out by British taxpayers at a cost of £45.5bn after coming unstuck trading risky derivatives and mortgage-backed securities. It remains majority-owned by the government almost a decade later. \nBut closer scrutiny by financial watchdogs could damage the appeal of bitcoin as a currency free of banks, regulators and governments.\nAnalysts at Saxobank estimate it could peak above $60,000 next year, giving the digital currency a total worth of more than $1tn, before crashing to $1,000 by 2019 as regulators introduce greater controls.\n",

        "text": "\nA former director of Barclays Bank who has also worked as a financial regulator has been appointed City minister by Theresa May.\nSteve Barclay, who backed the Vote Leave campaign, takes over the brief for the financial district at a time when other cities across the EU are aiming to grab business from the City after Brexit.\nOn Tuesday, Brussels outlined plans that could strip London of its coveted role in clearing financial assets denominated in euros amid warnings this could threaten 100,000 jobs across the UK. Big banks such as Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan have also said they would shift jobs out of London in response to Brexit.\nThe MP for North East Cambridgeshire, who was first elected in 2010, has the formal title of economic secretary to the Treasury and replaces Simon Kirby, who lost his seat in last week’s election and had faced criticism while in the role.\nBarclay, according to his website, qualified as a solicitor before working in financial regulation and then financial crime prevention. He was director of regulatory affairs and then head of anti-money laundering and sanctions in the high street banking operations of Barclays. Before Barclays he had worked at the City regulator, the Financial Services Authority, and has previously said that attempts to clean up the financial sector from money laundering were flawed.\nIn 2014, Barclay said: “When there is a high-risk multimillion-pound transaction, the bank files a suspicious activity report, but 93% of the reports are never read.”\nIt is not yet clear what Barclay’s remit will be at the Treasury. His predecessor was sidelined in March from overseeing Brexit’s impact on financial services, when the task was handed to Lucy Neville-Rolfe, who tweeted on Tuesday that she had left the government.\nBut Barclay gave a clue to his approach to his new role. Responding to a tweet congratulating him on his appointment the new City minister said: \n\n\nSteve Barclay MP \n(@SteveBarclay)\nThanks Iain. Be speaking up for those who create the wealth to pay for our public services. We need to champion business more in Parliament.\n\nJune 14, 2017\n\n\nMiles Celic, the chief executive of lobby group TheCityUK, welcomed his appointment. “It is vital we have more champions of business representing our industry in parliament,” he said. “As we begin the Brexit negotiations, it will be essential for the government and industry to maintain a strong, open and constructive dialogue.\n“This includes remaining focused on effective bridging and adaptation periods to allow for a smooth, orderly Brexit, mutual market access based on mutual recognition and regulatory cooperation, and the ability to access and supply the best global talent.”\nChris Cummings, the chief executive of the Investment Association, said: “As the UK enters the Brexit negotiations, it has never been more important for the City to have a minister who really understands and champions its needs.” \nBarclay will be one of the ministers working in the Treasury under Philip Hammond, who is due to give the chancellor’s annual Mansion House address on Thursday. Hammond’s audience of bankers will be looking for signs of any softening of the government’s stance towards Brexit.\nA replacement for Lady Neville-Rolfe as commercial secretary is yet to named, while Mel Stride has been named financial secretary and Liz Truss has been demoted from justice secretary to be chief secretary to the Treasury.\n",

        "text": "\nDouglas Flint has faced a number of calls for his resignation during his six years as chairman of HSBC. At last week’s annual shareholders’ meeting – his last – he was even asked whether he should be spending his retirement in jail.\nBut the 61-year-old, who has been on the board of the bank for 22 years, reckons he has faced far more difficult moments than a few question marks over whether he was doing a decent job. The worst, he says, was not the financial crisis of 2008, when he was the bank’s finance chief, but the record-breaking £1.2bn fine slapped on the bank for facilitating money laundering in 2012 and the deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) with the US department of justice that accompanied it. \nIt was a jaw-dropping, reputation-shredding time for the bank, especially the revelations that its Mexican branches had taken vast cash deposits from local drug barons, even making the tellers’ windows bigger so they were wide enough to accept their boxes of money.\nWithout that DPA – which former chancellor George Osborne helped to secure – HSBC, which is valued at £132bn on the stock market, could have lost its licence to operate in the US, with repercussions that could have threatened the bank’s future. “The most challenging period was dealing with the DPA and consequences of that,” recalls Flint now.\nThose consequences included accepting a “monitor” – US lawyer Michael Cherkasky was installed to make sure HSBC doesn’t slip back into bad ways and he has yet to finish his work, nearly five years later. It has meant a “huge investment in enhancing our standards”, says Flint. “Having that additional scrutiny is certainly quite consuming, all consuming.” \nBut the DPA marked only the beginning of HSBC’s reputational crisis. Revelations by the Guardian about the bank’s Swiss arm’s industrial-scale efforts to help clients evade tax culminated in the discovery that chief executive Stuart Gulliver had been paid through Panama. Then came the bank’s links to the law firm Mossack Fonseca in the Panama Papers, and accusations of Russian money laundering quickly followed.\nIn his corner office on the 42nd floor of HSBC’s headquarters in Canary Wharf, east London, the chairman’s desk is strewn with paper while books are stacked around the room.\n“We got through the banking crisis relatively well,” says Flint. “One has to be honest and say all banks benefited from the actions taken by public authorities to help those that were not in good shape, otherwise it would have filtered though to everyone else.”\nHSBC got through the crisis without needing an injection of taxpayers’ cash. Instead, shareholders stepped in, backing a record-breaking £12.5bn cash call in 2009.\nMany bank directors were cleared out after the crisis, but Flint has survived. Shareholder lobby group Manifest reckons only four other directors in the entire FTSE 100 have held a boardroom role for longer. He is now a regular on the international conference speakers circuit, sharing the stage with central bankers and politicians.\nHe was there during the bank’s global “dash for growth” – when it bought US subprime lender Household  in 2002 and the private bank Republic New York in 1999. And he was still there when those deals unravelled, and for all the scandals that followed. \nBut he insists he was right to ignore the calls to resign.\nThe members of the board took what he calls “personal collective responsibility”, he says, adding: “I know that’s nuanced thing. Of course if you’re in a leadership position you bear some responsibility, but as part of a team.”\n Since 1995, when Flint arrived, the bank’s balance sheet has ballooned from £226bn – around one-third of the size of the UK economy at the time – to £1.8tn, around the same size as the current UK economy (though that is in part because of changes to accounting rules).\nThat behemothic scale has provided ammunition for those that believe HSBC is too big to manage, too big to fail and too big to jail.\nFlint obviously disagrees: “We’ve got a very good management team. You can be large as long as you’ve got a well articulated business model”. \nAs for jail, Flint reckons there is no evidence that business people escaped justice: “I don’t think anyone is above the law but people in business shouldn’t be subject to different standards of proof than ordinary citizens.”\nHe says efforts are now under way to make the financial system cleaner. Rather than report unusual transactions that might indicate money laundering, for instance, the banks are now expected to root them out. “Public expectations have changed in terms of policing of the financial system,” he says. “What we have today is right.”\nHe likens it to the debate raging about controversial images posted on social media, which platforms such as Facebook insist are not their responsibility. “That would have been kind of where we were 25 years ago. It will be interesting to see whether public policy changes.”\nFlint\n’s successor is former Prudential boss Mark Tucker. He takes over on 1 October and will be the first outsider to ever chair the 152-year-old bank.\nTucker will then have to find a new chief executive – because Gulliver has made clear he is also ready to go – and steer the bank through Brexit. \nHSBC has already announced it is moving 1,000 roles to Paris as part of its preparations for a “hard” Brexit, but this is only one of the things on Tucker’s list: the wider European situation, free trade, the relationship between China and the US.\nBut Flint reckons London will survive as a financial centre, come what may. “We’re an industry that is used to change. The industry will reconfigure, London will reconfigure. The talent pool that is here, the ecosystem that exists of lawyers, accountants, trustees, the insurance market, brokers, every kind of financial sector player , the technology sector, legal system, the infrastructure and Greenwich mean time means that it’s an attractive place to run any business.”\n\n. \n",

        "title": "Why bitcoin and its digital cousins are under increasing scrutiny",
        "date": "2017-07-31T15:54:14Z",
        "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jul/31/cryptocurrencies-more-investment-way-pay-bitcoin-regulation",
        "text": "\nCryptocurrencies are under the microscope as never before. Financial regulators in the US are concerned about the emergence of bitcoin and its digital cousins as speculative investments and have hinted that much tougher regulation is in the pipeline.\nLast week, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which regulates the New York financial markets, issued an alert, saying it was “cautioning market participants that offers and sales of digital assets by ‘virtual’ organisations are subject to the requirements of the federal securities laws”.\nThe message was that selling coins issued by a digital currency provider and selling shares on the stock exchange amount to pretty much the same level of risk. This sent tremors through the digital currency industry.\nThe Bank of England, the UK’s main financial regulator, reckons that digital currencies remain very different from standard currencies such as sterling and the dollar because they “act as money only to a limited extent and only for relatively few people”. A spokeswoman for the Bank said it was monitoring developments.\nAt the same time, the consumer watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority, is considering the impact of digital currencies, and plans to report on its findings later this year.\nThe nub of the problems the authorities are considering is that digital currencies are behaving more like an investment than simply a way to pay. Supercharged increases in the value of bitcoin and ethereum, the two largest digital currencies, have recently driven the total value of cryptocurrencies to more than $100bn.\nCertainly, they are becoming more acceptable as money: consumers can buy a Dell computer with bitcoin and gift card businesses in the US accept bitcoin, which can then be used at big retailers such as Walmart, Amazon and Nike.\nIn the UK, Theatre Tickets Direct has recently started accepting bitcoin to buy tickets for London West End shows, along with the online craft beer supermarket Honest Brew.\n\n\n\n\nAre cryptocurrencies about to go mainstream?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeach Aviation, a low-cost Japanese airline, last month became Japan’s first airline to allow customers to pay directly for tickets using bitcoin. \nWhile some people are now being paid in bitcoin, others buy them from exchanges or directly via websites like eBay, from people who have “mined” the coins.\nBitcoin was invented in 2009 when an anonymous software developer issued the first of a limited number of coins based on the novel concept of a digital ledger or blockchain in which transactions made are recorded chronologically and publicly. Buyers and sellers remain anonymous, but the transactions are transparent and transferred at virtually no cost, unlike the transactions processed by stockbrokers and banks, which levy large fees.\nThe cryptocurrency quickly became popular among among tech businesses that needed to transfer large amounts of funds overseas, who saw the benefit of a cheap alternative to the major banks. Unsurprisingly, it also found ready users in the criminal class, for the purposes of buying and selling drugs online and money laundering.\nBut this year, bitcoin and ethereum have been behaving less like currencies and more like popular stocks that rise and fall according to market sentiment. Bitcoin’s value has trebled in a year and doubled in the past six months, to $2,648 last week, despite a 20% crash in its value in May and a slump from a peak of almost $2,900 to below $2,000 in the last two weeks.\nSome analysts have speculated that the currency’s value could reach $6,000 before the end of the year, making it behave more like a get-rich-quick speculative bubble, more akin to the “tulipmania” that scarred 17th-century Holland.\nOn Tuesday the blockchain supporting bitcoin is splitting in two, as members of the bitcoin community unhappy with the digital currency’s direction set up an alternative called Bitcoin Cash. However, Bitcoin Cash will likely only be worth a fraction of bitcoin. The original digital currency is trading at around $2,778.39, but future values for Bitcoin Cash are just $288.35, or 0.103 of a bitcoin.\nLast week the Russian national Alexander Vinnik, who allegedly defrauded early adopters of millions of pounds’ worth of bitcoins, including funds obtained from the hack of failed bitcoin exchange Mt Gox, was arrested in Greece.\nVinnik was described by the US Department of Justice as the operator of BTC-e, an exchange used to trade bitcoin since 2011, which was allegedly used to launder more than $4bn for people involved in crimes ranging from computer hacking to drug trafficking. Greek police claimed that the 38-year-old was an “an internationally sought ‘mastermind’ of a crime organisation”.\nUS authorities also linked him to the failure of Mt Gox, the Japan-based bitcoin exchange that collapsed in 2014 after being hacked. Vinnik “obtained” funds from the hack and laundered them through BTC-e and Tradehill, another San Francisco-based exchange he owned, according to court documents. Vinnik has copycats, who, it is widely speculated, also operate in Russia.\nThe Russian authorities have become increasingly concerned about the potential for digital currencies to be used for illicit means, but remain undecided about whether it is a currency or a financial asset. Elvira Nabiullina, governor of the Russian central bank, has said it should be regulated as a digital asset. “We don’t consider that bitcoin can be considered as a virtual currency,” she told CNBC.\nBut the country’s deputy finance minister, Alexey Moiseev, recently said the authorities hoped to recognise bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as a legal financial instrument next year in an attempt to tackle Vinnik-style money laundering.\nThe SEC is also under pressure from speculators to recognise bitcoin as a mainstream investment vehicle. The speculators lobbying for change include the Winklevoss twins, Cameron and Tyler, who won a $65m payout after they accused Mark Zuckerberg of stealing their social media idea as the basis for Facebook.\nThe brothers have since become involved in several cryptocurrency businesses and lobbied the SEC for clearance to launch a fund built to track the digital currency. Bitcoin, they reckon, is “better than gold”. Their lobbying effort has lasted three years so far, but in March was rejected again, triggering another tumble in the volatile price of the currency. But they haven’t given up, and it might not be long before clearance is achieved. A welter of regulation is likely to follow in its wake.\n",

        "text": "\nThere is another even stronger reason not to look to council tax to pay for social care (Councils spend less than ‘floor price’ on social care for elderly, 13 December). Poor people would have to meet the cost. This is due to abolition by the coalition government of their previous entitlement to council tax benefit – and successive governments’ failure to get the better-off to pay their fair share by revaluing properties to reflect current values and introducing new higher tax bands.\nThe government’s transitional grant for the discretionary relief scheme which replaced council tax benefit was soon withdrawn at the same time as government grant to local authorities was being cut – and is soon to disappear altogether with termination of the revenue support grant which used to be the main source of government funding.\nFew councils are now able to support poor council tax payers to the level of the old benefit entitlement. In most parts of the country almost everyone has to pay council tax, including people on jobseeker’s allowance, employment and support allowance, income support and pension credit. Poor people cannot afford to pay what is already demanded of them, let alone more. Council tax is now so regressive as to mirror the poll tax. No wonder so many authorities are reluctant to raise the full social care precept and increase further the already steep growth in proceedings for arrears of council tax, with its attendant misery.\nThe government must face up to the crisis and increase its funding to local authorities through progressive taxation. The most vulnerable members of our society are suffering untold misery without relief in sight. Are we a civilised society or not? This is the major test of us as good neighbours in deed as well as word.David PlankCambridge\n• To provide desperately needed funding for social care, the government plans to allow councils to increase council tax. We must care for those who are disabled, ill and infirm, but the problem is that council tax is regressive – falling hardest on poorer people, because it takes up a much greater share of their income. We must not increase the load on those who are already struggling to stay afloat.\nTax is the price we pay for a civilised society. In a civilised society, we look after those who need care. In a civilised society, we also give more if we can afford more. In the context of cuts to taxes on corporations, avoidance of tax by the wealthy and a £370m refurbishment of Buckingham Palace, the government must find a way to share this necessary burden more fairly, so that those who are struggling are not made more desperate.Angela DennisKingston upon Thames\n• Odd, isn’t it, that a country pleading poverty, a country refusing to afford proper care for its people, readily affords boundless care for places? Though only special places, of course. Those like Jersey, the Caymans, the British Virgin Islands, Bermuda, the City, the Isle of Man and on and on.\nWhen will Mrs May acknowledge that tax-dodging, money-laundering and routine corruption cost this country far, far more than caring for people ever will? And when will she do something about it beyond reinventing the poll tax?John SmithSheffield\n• How to meet the spiralling costs of adult social care? To put it on the council tax will not even scratch the surface of the problem in Lincolnshire, where we have the highest proportion of senior citizens in the east Midlands and one of the lowest council tax bases. To suggest this is a cop-out. We need to take the politics out of this and stop just passing the buck.\nThe only way to finance a problem that will not go away is for us all to make a greater contribution, through national insurance contributions and/or by biting the bullet and paying higher income tax. It may now be time to combine spending on health and social care as well.John MarriottNorth Hykeham, Lincolnshire\n• The growing crisis in social care is generally described in terms of the impact on the wider healthcare system, with some commentators also acknowledging the anxiety caused among the huge number of frail and vulnerable residents of care homes and their families who could find themselves being victims of a market failure. But there is another equally large group of people who will be badly affected if the system does collapse under the weight of governmental lack of interest and blame-shifting – the many thousands of people, predominantly in low-paid work, who stand to lose their jobs. When it looked like Nissan was considering whether to continue manufacturing in the north-east, ministers pulled out the stops, and deals were done to calm corporate nerves. If things are as bad as they seem to be in the care sector then far more jobs are now at stake – the difference being that they are not all in one town, and the workforce is overwhelmingly female. The time for ministerial intervention has come.Les BrightExeter, Devon \n• If it wasn’t already obvious, the Conservative government have all but admitted that they don’t know how to fix the problems with social care provision. So why don’t they ask Ed Miliband what he was planning to do before the 2015 general election, when he was the one talking about addressing the upstream problems with social care funding that were in turn putting additional burdens on the NHS (as opposed to just promising to throw money at the NHS as the Conservatives and Lib Dems said they’d do)? They’ve pinched most of his other manifesto policies already, so what difference will pinching another make?David WallNorthampton \n• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com\n• Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters\n",

        "text": "\nBrexit could damage the UK’s efforts to tackle corruption and give multinationals leverage over the British government in bribery cases, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has warned.\nBusiness pressure to weaken bribery laws and an inability by the government to focus on non-Brexit issues are both risks associated with leaving the European Union, according to a new report by the group.\nWhile acknowledging the UK’s “solid progress” in pursuing recent bribery investigations, the report warned that the proportion of cases relative to the country’s importance in global finance was low.\n\n\n\n\nPro-Brexit ministers 'relaxed about leaving EU without trade deal'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Efforts must be sustained to improve detection of foreign bribery and achieve stronger enforcement of its anti-bribery legislation,” it said.\nThe report praises the UK’s Serious Fraud Office (SFO) for recent successes in pursuing major corruption cases, including a multimillion-pound settlement with the engineering giant Rolls-Royce earlier this year.\nHowever, several civil society groups told the report’s authors they were concerned that “Brexit could increase the risk of UK companies threatening to relocate and potential loss of UK jobs as a bargaining chip in negotiations with prosecutors over charges”.\n“Given that the SFO has on its books some very large UK companies that are significant partners in the government’s industrial strategy, this is a real concern for several NGOs in the UK,” the report said.\n“This concern was echoed by the business community which highlighted the risk of losing impetus in the fight against foreign bribery.”\nDuncan Hames, director of policy for Transparency International UK, said the OECD report “reinforces how important it is to maintain the independence and prosecution of serious bribery offences”.\nHe added: “Those kind of considerations and threats shouldn’t have any influence whatever in prosecuting wrongdoing wherever we find it.”\nThe report also warns that any potential economic downturn resulting from leaving the EU could damage government willingness to be seen to be aggressively regulating business.\n“A tightening of the economy could result in significant strain on public resources, including for law enforcement, and in pressure to weaken the Bribery Act or its enforcement to attract business,” it said.\nSue Hawley, policy director of the civil society group Corruption Watch, said her organisation had warned of this risk last year, but recent events, including the creation of settlements whereby companies can resolve investigations with a fine and apology, had already damaged the UK’s stance as a country hostile to corrupt money.\nHawley cited interference by Tony Blair’s government in the Serious Fraud Office investigation into BAE as an example of the kind of political interference about which the OECD would be concerned.\nDespite condemnation by the OECD after the BAE debacle, UK guidelines to law enforcement still do not prohibit factoring economic or political considerations into any prosecution decision.\nSeparately, the OECD report also identifies Scotland, where highly secretive “limited partnerships” can be incorporated, as notably vulnerable to money laundering. \n“The controversial limited partnership status, or so-called ‘shell’ companies, in Scotland appears to be vulnerable for misuse in money-laundering and corruption schemes,” the report said.\n“This has prompted Scottish politicians to suggest that the murky nature of such arrangements is undermining Scotland’s reputation as a place to do legitimate business.”\nIn a statement a Cabinet Office spokesperson said: “The government welcomes this report by the OECD which recognises our active enforcement of anti-bribery laws and we are proud that the UK continues to be commended as a global leader in the fight against bribery.\n“We will consider the recommendations made by the OECD as we continue to make the UK a more hostile environment for all forms of economic crime, including bribery, money laundering and fraud.”\n",

        "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/nov/30/the-disaster-artist-review-james-franco-tommy-wiseau-the-room",
        "text": "\nThe hugely prolific actor and film-maker James Franco started his career on TV’s Freaks and Geeks and has also directed adaptations of Faulkner and Steinbeck. Now he combines his funny and serious sides in a ratio of about four to one in this entertaining, if weirdly incurious and incomplete true-life story. Tommy Wiseau was a bizarre man of indeterminate age and background who became a cult figure in Los Angeles in 2003 for The Room – a toe-curlingly awful film he financed, directed, wrote and starred in. He also paid for cinema hire, a lavish premiere and a prominent billboard. Connoisseurs of irony and awfulness were intrigued: terrible dialogue, car-crash emoting, leaden editing, ridiculous sets. The movie gradually took on a Rocky Horror life of its own, and came to Britain on a kind of so-bad-it’s-the-best-ever tour in 2009. Underemployed masochists can watch it on YouTube.\nFranco himself plays Tommy, the bizarre, long-haired dude with the weird accent and a lot of money. Dave Franco plays Greg Sestero, the wide-eyed, unemployed actor Tommy persuades to come to LA with him and be in the film; The Disaster Artist is adapted from Sestero’s 2013 memoir of acting in his anti-masterpiece. Seth Rogen plays the long-suffering script supervisor, and there are many big-name stars coyly cast in small roles, winners whose presence underlines the comedy of loserdom.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\nFranco is often very funny as Tommy, the crazy guy who we first see trying out for theatre productions in San Francisco, baffling directors with his wordless primal-scream improv spectaculars. Poor Greg is dazzled by Tommy’s pure life force and accepts his invitation to accompany him to LA to make it in the movies and live with him in a modest apartment that Tommy appears to own. Getting nowhere as an actor, Tommy resolves to make his own film. The rest is history – and tragicomedy.\nSo-bad-it’s-good is an accepted genre. I first came across it with Kenny Everett’s Bottom-30 hit parade of pop horror on Capital Radio in the 70s, and the accepted approach is that we forgive ourselves for our malice in laughing at these people by coming to celebrate them affectionately as modern-day Quixotes. Johnny Depp played hopeless B-movie auteur Ed Wood Jr as a never-say-die idealist who rescued Bela Lugosi from unemployment; Meryl Streep gave life to the deluded classical singer, Florence Foster Jenkins, who was rich enough to pay people to listen to her off-key warbling. In real life, Jerry Lewis bankrolled his own sentimental Nazi comedy The Day the Clown Cried, but no one had the chance to mock and then forgive that because it was withdrawn from view. In fiction of course there is the musical Springtime for Hitler in Mel Brooks’s comedy The Producers, the tax-cheat flop that becomes a hit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Hollywood dreamers … Sharon Stone and Dave Franco. Photograph: Allstar/New Line Cinema\n\n\nBut wait. Where was Tommy’s money coming from? And where, come to that, was he from? Those squeamish about spoilers or financial reality had better look away now, because the film never answers these questions. There are rumours, only hinted at here, that Tommy hails from Poland or Romania. But the funding for his film? Dodgy dealings? Money laundering? Or is he just that most banal of things, a rich kid who wanted to be a supercool movie star? These important facts are withheld from the audience, and it gave me the uncomfortable feeling that we are still being played, just a bit.\n\n\n\n\nJames Franco: ‘I was certainly taking myself too seriously before. But who doesn’t?’\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are some funny scenes, and Franco’s crazy, strangulated, glottal-stopped voice is incredible; it reminded me of Benny Hill’s notoriously offensive Chinese or possibly Japanese guy shouting: “You sirry iriot.” If Tommy didn’t exist, Judd Apatow would have to invent him, and Apatow duly makes a cameo appearance as a Hollywood producer, having dinner at a restaurant and mortified when Tommy comes up and tries to interest him in his career. His agonies getting his film made are fascinating because they are the same problems faced by talented people: handling actors, equipment, time schedules. His own incompetence makes the nuts and bolts of indie film-making visible.\nBut there are limits to how interesting so-bad-it’s-good really is. I am more afraid of so-good-it’s-bad: middlebrow ghastly good taste, period drama from the classiest of names, often garlanded with Oscars. In the end, The Disaster Artist teaches us a great truth. Life is too short for anything except so-good-it’s-good.\n",

        "text": "\nBritain’s commitment to tackling high-end money laundering through the City of London is under serious scrutiny after it emerged that regulators appear to have waved through an $800m bank transfer to a convicted criminal as the proceeds from one of the most corrupt deals in the history of the oil industry.\nA joint investigation by the Observer and journalists from Finance Uncovered, a non-profit organisation based in London, has discovered that prosecutors in Milan believe two payments of $400m each were wired through JP Morgan in London as the spoils of a huge deal to develop a Nigerian oilfield involving Shell, its joint venture partner the Italian oil giant Eni, and the government in Abuja.\nMore than half the money was converted into bags of bribe cash via bureaux de change in Nigeria, while tens of millions was wired to buy a private jet and armoured cars in the US, according to documents compiled by the prosecutors. But ordinary citizens of Nigeria have not seen a penny from the deal – which, it is alleged, was partly negotiated by two ex-MI6 officers hired by Shell as “business and investment advisers”.\nThe astonishing allegations have been made by an Italian prosecutor, Fabio de Pasquale, whose previous scalps include former Italian leader Silvio Berlusconi.\nDe Pasquale and his team have spent more than two years following the money trail surrounding the murky sale of Nigeria’s prized Oil Prospecting Licence 245 (OPL 245), a huge block off the coast of west Africa estimated to contain 9.3bn barrels of crude: enough to power the continent for seven years.\nOil giants from the west, China and Russia have coveted its riches for years. But Shell and Eni eventually prevailed, paying $1.3bn to the Nigerian government to secure the field in 2011.\nHowever, within days the bulk of the money was transferred through JP Morgan in London to a convicted Nigerian money launderer – a man with whom both Shell and Eni had been negotiating.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Italian prosecutor Fabio De Pasquale has previously pursued prime minister Silvio Berlusconi through the courts. Photograph: AFP/Getty Images\n\n\n“The UK authorities have some serious explaining to do,” said Barnaby Pace, a campaigner with the anti-corruption watchdog Global Witness, which has investigated this case for several years.\nDe Pasquale has carried out raids on Eni offices in Italy and Shell’s headquarters in The Hague that have yielded tens of thousands of documents and emails.\nLast month he requested that an Italian court charge 10 individuals, including five high-ranking executives from Eni, with corruption-related offences. Shell, as a corporate entity, was also included in the request, which will be considered by a court in Milan next month. Shell, Eni and all the executives named by De Pasquale strongly deny the allegations.\nDe Pasquale has also formally warned four former Shell employees, who allegedly played significant roles in securing the deal, that they could be subject to separate proceedings. Among them are Guy Colegate and John Copleston, identified by De Pasquale in legal documents as having “previously worked for MI6”.\nCopleston was a “strategic investment adviser” at Shell who, as the UK’s former intelligence representative in Nigeria, had nurtured contacts at the highest levels of the country’s military and government. Colegate worked as a “business adviser”, compiling regular intelligence briefings on the main actors in the OPL 245 negotiations.\nAs Shell eyed OPL 245, both the CIA and the Foreign Office were aware that Vladimir Putin and Russia were considering trying to snatch Nigerian assets from the west.\nThe OPL 245 licence had proved particularly elusive. In 1998, Nigeria’s then oil minister, Dan Etete, had awarded it to a shady new company, Malabu Oil and Gas, in which, it later emerged, he held a significant stake.\nBut after a new president came to power, Malabu lost the licence and it was assigned to Shell. Later the position reversed and Shell began legal proceedings against the Nigerian government.\nEtete was convicted in a Paris court in 2007 for his part in a separate money-laundering scandal. But this did not appear to deter Shell and Eni from continuing to court him at luxury hotels in Europe and Nigeria. After one lunch with Etete in 2009 to discuss his asking price for OPL 245, it is reported that Copleston copied Colegate on an email to say it had gone well, helped along by “lots of iced champagne”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Former Nigerian oil minister Dan Etete. Photograph: Heinz-Peter Bader/Reuters\n\n\nIn 2010, negotiations swung Shell’s way when Goodluck Jonathan, an ally of Etete’s, became Nigeria’s president.\nThe following year, the $1.3bn deal was struck, with Malabu entitled to $1.1bn and the Nigerian government a $210m “signature fee”. Shell and Eni paid the money directly to the Nigerian government.\nA fixer involved in the deal described this approach as putting a “condom” between the buyer and seller so that at no point would Shell or Eni make direct payments to Malabu or Etete, who was officially recognised as a criminal. But in May 2011, days after the Nigerian government received the money, its officials instructed JP Morgan to transfer the $1.1bn to an account in Switzerland.\nAt this point red flags should have been raised in London. Under money-laundering regulations, banks are required to raise Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) for highly unusual transactions, especially involving what are called “politically exposed persons” such as Etete. These reports are raised confidentially with the UK Financial Investigations Unit, which in 2011 was part of the Home Office’s Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca).\nBanks are forbidden from confirming whether they have raised SARs, and both JP Morgan and the National Crime Agency – Soca’s successor – have declined to comment on the matter.\nHowever, a source indicated that JP Morgan had raised an SAR as soon as it received the request from Nigeria.\nIt is understood that the bank would not have proceeded without a green light from Soca.\nWell-placed sources offer three possible explanations for why the UK authorities allowed the transfer to go through. Either they saw no problem with it; or they were aware of the money’s provenance but, because the Nigerian government itself saw no corruption, there was little that could be done to secure evidence for a freezing order; or they wanted to track how the funds were disbursed to help gain intelligence.\nWhatever the explanation, the transfer immediately ran into difficulties. BSI Lugano, a Swiss bank, rejected the payment, citing Etete’s money-laundering conviction. In August, JP Morgan then made a second attempt via a Lebanese bank to pay the money to Malabu, but this too was rejected. However, a fortnight later the bank was able to transfer the money, in separate tranches of $400m to two Nigerian banks.\nWhere all of it ended up will probably never be known. De Pasquale alleges that President Jonathan received some of the money, but he denies the claim.\nColegate did not respond to requests for comment. Attempts to reach Copleston were unsuccessful. It was not possible to contact Etete, while Eni declined to comment.\nA spokeswoman for Shell said: “Based on our review of the prosecutor’s file and our understanding of the facts, we don’t believe a request for indictment is justified and we are confident that this will be determined in the next stages of the proceedings. We continue to take this matter seriously and cooperate with the authorities.”\nAsked about its intelligence-gathering operations, Shell said: “Like most multinational organisations, Shell takes the duty to protect its people, assets and commercially sensitive information seriously and hires those with the most relevant experience to join its corporate security team, including on occasion former government personnel.”\nPace said the scandal highlighted the City of London’s failure to combat money laundering, something that the previous prime minister, David Cameron, had identified as a key priority and which development agencies say is vital if the assets of African countries are not to end up being lost to corruption.\n“If we want to stop this kind of deal happening in future, we need to address the system that made it possible,” Pace said. “That means accountability for those that enable corruption in major financial centres like London.”\n",

        "title": "Deutsche Bank's $630m Russian fine reflects badly on banking | Nils Pratley",

        "text": "\nBig international banks provide the frontline troops in the battle against financial crime, or so their bosses like to say. In the post-crisis era, battalions of compliance officers have been recruited and trained. The costs are enormous and still increasing, say the banks, but financial regulators have got what they demanded. All banks must know their clients, including where and how they got their money, and the supporting documentation has to be pristine, especially if chunky sums are moving across borders.\nThat’s the theory, but then there’s the practice. At Deutsche Bank, circa 2012 to 2015, the system was an underfunded shambles. The bank has been fined $630m (£506m) for “unacceptable” deficiencies in its anti-money laundering controls but the details of the affair are extraordinary. Some $10bn was transferred out of Russia through Deutsche “in a manner highly suggestive of financial crime”, says the Financial Conduct Authority.\nRed flags should have been everywhere in a wheeze whereby shares were bought in roubles in Deutsche’s Moscow branch and then sold via the London office for dollars. These so-called mirror trades lacked “legitimate economic rationale”, says New York’s Department of Financial Services – the other regulator on the case. The counterparties, typically registered offshore, were always related and often linked by common beneficial owners.\n\n\n\n\nDeutsche Bank fined $630m over Russia money laundering claims\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost damning of all, a few Deutsche employees detected something rotten but their concerns were either ignored or allowed to fizzle out inconclusively. Traders in Moscow were told not to worry and to get on with their jobs. A senior compliance officer complained he had to “beg, borrow and steal” to receive appropriate resources.\nThis tale of gross incompetence at one of the world’s largest banks would be easier to understand if it had emerged from the pre-crash era of light-touch regulation. But, to repeat, the events happened as recently as 2012 to 2015, well after the hardening in the regulatory mood.\nWe must assume, or hope, that most other international banks fulfil their duties and that Deutsche’s systems and controls were uniquely dreadful. If not, all these fine boasts about how the banks are performing a service for the world by cleaning up the financial system aren’t worth a rouble.\nOcado chances its arm with technology\nIt’s an engineering triumph: a robotic arm that can pick up an apple without damaging it. The accompanying video clip suggests Ocado’s mechanical device is still about 20 times slower than the average human in performing the task but, hey, big breakthroughs can take years.\nThey certainly can at Ocado. The big advance that interests investors is a deal with an international customer to licence the already-deployed technology that powers Ocado’s warehouses. The online grocer first promised such a deal in 2015. It never arrived. Then 2016 came and went. And now? “We expect to sign multiple deals in multiple territories in the medium term,” says chief executive Tim Steiner, wisely avoiding defining the medium term.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\nOcado’s SoMa robot arm picking an apple\n\n\n\nMaybe – just maybe – the confidence is merited this time. Ocado has its new distribution centre up and running in Andover in Hampshire, so it can display its latest technology in action rather than on the drawing board. The deal has to happen, though. The extended arrangement with Morrisons can’t sustain expectations indefinitely.\nThe best advert for the technology would, of course, be booming profits in Ocado’s core business of delivering groceries in the UK. On that score, progress is mixed. Revenues rose almost 15% in the financial year to last November but profit before tax, hit by a £2.4m exceptional item, improved only 1% to £12.1m.\nOcado generates sufficient cash to open more warehouses and, it revealed, employ a remarkable 950 IT and software professionals in four countries. The concentration on technological improvement is admirable and Steiner is entitled to boast about the 50 patent applications. In the end, though, the Ocado Smart Platform is only properly smart if other companies want to pay decent money to licence it.\nVW motors into a fresh pay controversy\nHow’s the corporate revamp at Volkswagen going? Very nicely if you are Christine Hohmann-Dennhardt, the compliance chief recruited after the great diesel emissions scandal. She will leave the carmaker after earning more than €10m for 13 months’ work.\nHer departure, said VW, was prompted by “differences in the understanding of responsibilities and future operating structures within the function she leads.” Translation: there was a bust-up.\nHohmann-Dennhardt has earned her euros, apparently, because she had to be bought out of her contract at Daimler and now VW has to pay the full three years of the employment contract it signed with her.\nThat explains the formal mechanics of the €10bn. But it does not explain why the German carmaker, whose board was one of the most highly paid in Europe when the emissions cheating was exposed, appears to have learned nothing about how to reform remuneration after a corporate calamity.\n",

He cut a deal to incriminate bigger players and claimed he had been involved with government intelligence agencies from the outset – this movie sportingly takes him at his word. \nCruise plays Barry Seal, competent but bored airline pilot and impeccable husband to super-hot wife Lucy (Sarah Wright). He is very excited to be approached by shadowy CIA man Schafer (Domhnall Gleeson) and asked to fly a spy plane over Central America to photograph communist insurgents. His roistering antics catch the attention of Pablo Escobar’s drug barons who force him to fly their cocaine to the US. Then he is bullied by Schafer with a new plan: fly guns to Nicaragua’s anti-communist rebels, the contras, who are actually more interested in selling the drugs that the Colombians had given them in exchange for these guns – a murky setup which the movie suggests laid the foundations for the Iran-Contra deal. \nIt’s a salacious war-story picture that leans heavily on the voiceover-flashback style pioneered in GoodFellas, and it reminded me a little of Ted Demme’s tiresome coke history Blow (2001), or more recently something like Todd Phillips’s War Dogs (2016). But the beamingly ingenuous Cruise, whose character is not burdened with any doubts or an inner life, somehow sells it to you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n",

        "text": "\nThe actor and environmentalist Leonardo DiCaprio is being urged to repay donations connected to the Malaysian fund that backed his hit film The Wolf of Wall Street and is now subject to a US justice department investigation and asset seizure effort.\nThe calls come from the Bruno Manser Funds, a Swiss-based charity focused on protecting the Malaysian rainforest. According to the Hollywood Reporter, the organization accused the star of “double standards” for accepting donations linked to an international money laundering scandal.\n\n\n\n\nWolf of Wall Street film linked to money 'stolen from Malaysian fund', US claims\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe charity claims that while DiCaprio has been engaged in an effort to protect the last remaining tracts of rainforest in Sumatra, the scandal-plagued 1MDB fund, which participated in a fundraising Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation auction at Christie’s in 2013, is connected to Malaysian deforestation less than 500 miles away.\n“We are deeply disturbed that Leonardo DiCaprio and his foundation accepted assets that originate from the proceeds of corruption in Malaysia. This is a disgrace and in total contradiction with the declared aims of the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation,” said Lukas Straumann, director of the Bruno Manser Fund. “We call on DiCaprio to apologize and pay back all this dirty money to the Malaysian people.”\nHe told the Hollywood Reporter: “We hear he has a genuine commitment to nature and championing indigenous rights … but if it comes to accepting stolen money, that’s a simple no go.” \nAccording to the fund, DiCaprio received money from controversial businessman Jho Low and Riza Shahriz Bin Abdul Aziz, the stepson of the Malaysian prime minister, Najib Razak – both figures named in a justice department asset seizure complaint and connected to the 1MDB sovereign wealth fund.\nThe Manser fund claims the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation received money from a Christie’s charity auction in 2013, where Low is alleged to have used $1.1m of diverted 1MDB funds to buy two works of art by Ed Ruscha and Mark Ryden.\nThe charity claims that political corruption in Malaysia is a “major driver” of deforestation, with local politicians handed lucrative logging contracts as bribes.\n“It’s a corrupt system and directly affects the way natural resources are being handled,” Straumann told the Hollywood Reporter. “Politicians in Malaysia have earned billions of dollars from cutting down the rainforest illegally.” \nAn investigation by the Hollywood trade paper found further examples that the publication claims were channels for 1MDB funds to enter DiCaprio’s charity. It claims Low and Joey McFarland, cofounder of Red Granite, the production company behind The Wolf of Wall Street, were among those who helped raise $3m for the foundation by buying marked-up bottles of champagne at DiCaprio’s birthday party. \n\n\n\n\n1MDB: The inside story of the world’s biggest financial scandal | Randeep Ramesh\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast year, Low donated a Roy Lichtenstein sculpture, 1982’s Brushstroke, valued at roughly $700,000, to the foundation, which was then auctioned at a charity event in St Tropez.\nThe Swiss charity is named for the environmentalist Bruno Manser, who lived in Sarawak, Malaysia, with the Penan tribe, one of the last hunter-gatherer tribes in the region. Manser organized several blockades against timber companies, angering Malaysian authorities, and later became a prominent campaigner for rainforest preservation and the rights of indigenous peoples. He disappeared during his last journey to Sarawak in May 2000 and is presumed dead.\nThe claims place DiCaprio in an awkward position. His latest environmental documentary, Before the Flood, is due to have its premiere at the Toronto international film festival next month. The film, by Fisher Stevens, the documentary film-maker behind 2010’s Academy Award winner The Cove, follows DiCaprio around the world as he draws attention to environmental issues. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Leonardo DiCaprio and Fisher Stevens take a break from working on the forthcoming climate change documentary Before the Flood, on 23 August 2016 in New York City. Photograph: Michael Stewart/WireImage\n\n\nThe Bruno Manser letter comes a week after THR published a lengthy story questioning the DiCaprio foundation’s ties to 1MDB. In it, Straumann alleges that the actor was paid as much as $25m for The Wolf of Wall Street from funds allegedly siphoned off from 1MBD. “Money was stolen from the treasury and went straight into Leo’s pocket,” Straumann is quoted as saying.\nThe justice department  complaint does not target DiCaprio specifically – he’s referred to twice in the 136-page document and only as “Hollywood Actor 1” – but any funds originating with 1MDB that ended up in the foundation or were paid to DiCaprio directly for work or as a credited producer on The Wolf of Wall Street could legitimately be targeted by the justice department. \nDiCaprio started the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation in 1998. It is “dedicated to the long-term health and wellbeing of all Earth’s inhabitants”, according to the organization’s website.\nThe foundation has donated $3m to the WWF tiger conservation program in Nepal with the other $3m grant heading to Oceana to help save the oceans and marine animals from unsustainable fishing methods. It recently donated $1m to the Elephant Crisis Fund.\nAccording to the Wildlife Conservation Network, the grant “will be sued to save elephants from the current ivory poaching crisis by funding on-the-ground projects that stop poaching, trafficking and the demand for ivory”.\n“Elephant poaching is a brutal crisis, with more than 30,000 elephants killed last year alone,” said DiCaprio. “The decimation of these animals is something we have the power to stop, and the Elephant Crisis Fund is a crucial part of the solution. I am honored to support them.”\nEarlier this week, Terry Tamminen, CEO of the foundation, told THR the organisation had made grants of more than $30m this year and described the foundation as “an incredibly efficient, highly effective philanthropic organization that, through its relationship to the California Community Foundation, is supporting credible organizations that are carrying out some of the most important work on the planet”.\n",

        "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/30/bitcoin-is-a-vehicle-for-fraudsters-warns-goldman-sachs-boss",
        "text": "\nThe boss of Goldman Sachs became the latest high-profile critic of bitcoin, claiming it was a vehicle to commit fraud as the value of the cryptocurrency plunged 20% in less than 24 hours.\nLloyd Blankfein, chief executive of the US investment bank, said: “Something that moves 20% [overnight] does not feel like a currency. It is a vehicle to perpetrate fraud.”\n\n\n Q&A What is bitcoin and is it a bad investment?  \n\n\n Show \n\n\n Hide  \n\n\nBitcoin is the first, and the biggest, \"cryptocurrency\" – a decentralised tradable digital asset. Whether it is a bad investment is the big question. Bitcoin can only be used as a medium of exchange and in practice has been far more important for the dark economy than it has for most legitimate uses. The lack of any central authority makes bitcoin remarkably resilient to censorship, corruption – or regulation. That means it has attracted a range of backers, from libertarian monetarists who enjoy the idea of a currency with no inflation and no central bank, to drug dealers who like the fact that it is hard (but not impossible) to trace a bitcoin transaction back to a physical person.\n\n\n\n\nWas this helpful?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you for your feedback.\n\n\n\n\nHis comments came during another wildly volatile trading session for the digital currency, which plunged by over $2,000 in a 24-hour period. Having topped $11,000 to reach a new record high of $11,395 on Wednesday, it fell to a low of $9,000 on Thursday, before picking up slightly later in the day.\nBlankfein said Goldman did not need to have a bitcoin strategy, adding the digital currency would need to be a lot less volatile and a lot more liquid to justify closer attention.\n“When do I have to have a bitcoin strategy? Not today. Life must be really rosy if that is what we are talking about,” he said. “Bitcoin is not for me. A lot of things that have not been for me in the past 20 years have worked out, but I am not guessing that this will work out.”\n\n\n\n\nDon’t let the bankers fool you: bitcoin is here to stay | Dominic Frisby\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlankfein is the latest boss of a major bank to voice scepticism about bitcoin, after JP Morgan’s chief executive, Jamie Dimon, described it as fraud that would ultimately blow up and said it was only fit for use by drug dealers, murderers and people living in places such as North Korea.\nOn Wednesday, Sir Jon Cunliffe, a deputy governor of the Bank of England, said the digital currency was too small to pose a systemic threat to the global economy. He also cautioned that bitcoin investors needed “to do their homework”.\nDespite the fall in bitcoin’s value on Thursday, it remained far higher than it was at the start of 2017, when it was trading at $998. It is the biggest gainer of all asset classes this year, prompting sceptics to declare it a classic speculative bubble that could burst.\nBanks and other financial institutions remain concerned about bitcoin’s early associations with money laundering and online crime. Unlike traditional currencies, bitcoin is not issued or regulated by a central bank or government.\n\nbitcoin\n\nLee Wild, head of equity strategy at online trading company Interactive Investor, said the volatility in bitcoin trading was “wild west stuff”.\n“Cryptocurrency land’s extreme volatility is like catnip to high-risk traders, and even traditional investors are dipping their toe. Given there’s no logical way to value them with any accuracy, this remains wild west stuff.”\nAnalysts at the spread betting firm, City Index, said: “While traditional assets are experiencing historically low levels of volatility, the whipsaw action of the bitcoin is drawing the attention of traditional traders. Meanwhile existing traders and newcomers are increasingly interested in fear of missing out.”\n",

        "text": "\nBitcoin topped $11,000 on Wednesday, less than 24 hours after hitting $10,000 for the first time, as central bankers on both sides of the Atlantic sought to ease fears that a potential bubble in the cryptocurrency was a threat to the global economy.\nThe digital currency continued on its record-breaking streak, rising to $11,150 just as analysts were digesting the news that it had made it through $10,000. However, it then fell back below $10,500, again highlighting its volatility.\nBitcoin has risen tenfold in value so far this year, the largest gain of all asset classes, prompting sceptics to declare it a classic speculative bubble that could burst, like the dotcom boom and the US sub-prime housing crash that triggered the global financial crisis.\n\n\n Q&A What is bitcoin and is it a bad investment?  \n\n\n Show \n\n\n Hide  \n\n\nBitcoin is the first, and the biggest, \"cryptocurrency\" – a decentralised tradable digital asset. Whether it is a bad investment is the big question. Bitcoin can only be used as a medium of exchange and in practice has been far more important for the dark economy than it has for most legitimate uses. The lack of any central authority makes bitcoin remarkably resilient to censorship, corruption – or regulation. That means it has attracted a range of backers, from libertarian monetarists who enjoy the idea of a currency with no inflation and no central bank, to drug dealers who like the fact that it is hard (but not impossible) to trace a bitcoin transaction back to a physical person.\n\n\n\n\nWas this helpful?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you for your feedback.\n\n\n\n\n “The madness of crowds is well documented, but it is quite something to behold in the flesh. It’s hard to keep up with this – bitcoin just flew past the $11,000 mark, leaping $200 in barely five minutes before taking another big leg higher,” said Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Captial. \n“It’s up more than 14% today alone and the year-to-date chart is simply staggering. There are no fundamentals or technicals that explain this other than it being a massive speculative bubble.”\nThe rapid growth in the value and popularity of the virtual currency, which emerged in the aftermath of the financial crisis and allows people to bypass banks and traditional payment methods to pay for goods and services, has forced central banks, financial regulators and institutions to consider how to respond.\n\n\n\n\nBitcoin has broken the $10,000 barrier – and this run can go further | Dominic Frisby\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSir Jon Cunliffe, a deputy governor at the Bank of England with financial stability, said bitcoin was too small to pose a risk to the global economy.\nHe told BBC Radio 5 Live: “This is not a currency in the accepted sense. There’s no central bank that stands behind it. For me it’s much more like a commodity.\n“This is not at a size where it’s a macroeconomic risk to the global economy, but when prices are moving like that, my view would be investors need to do their homework.”\nOver in the US, William Dudley, the president and chief executive of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said bitcoin is “more of a speculative activity” than a currency.\n“I would be pretty cautionary about it. I think that it’s not a stable store of value,” he said at an event in New Jersey. “I would be, at this point, pretty sceptical of bitcoin,” he added.\nDudley echoed Cunliffe’s point that the bitcoin is still relatively small. “Bitcoin is tiny relative to the amount of payment transactions that are executed in the United States.”\nCommenting on the idea that the Fed could potentially offer it own digital currencies, he said: “I think at this point it’s really very premature to be talking about the Federal Reserve offering digital currencies, but it is something we are starting to think about.”\nBanks and other financial institutions have been concerned about bitcoin’s early associations with money laundering and online crime, and it has not been adopted by any government.\nThe JP Morgan chief executive, Jamie Dimon, has described bitcoin as “worse than tulips”, in reference to a famous market bubble from the 1600s. Speaking in September, Dimon said the digital currency was a fraud that would ultimately blow up, adding it was only fit for use by drug dealers, murderers and people living in places such as North Korea.\nHowever, according to reports last week, JP Morgan is considering whether to help its own clients bet on the price of bitcoin through proposed futures contracts to be offered by CME Group. The bank would collect fees for providing such a service.\nDennis de Jong, the managing director at the online currency broker UFX, said the value of the cryptocurrency was likely to rise further.\n“Until bitcoin becomes a commonly used payment source, it’s very possible that it could hit $15,000 and beyond based on its current desirability,” he said. “If bitcoin falls into wider circulation, and becomes accepted into more conventional funds and exchanges, we are likely to see a normalisation of its value.”\n• Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.\n",

        "text": "\nPity the poor celebrity who has worked hard to create a name for themselves only for someone else to come along to use it. The latest is Yoko Ono, who has successfully managed to get a bar in Hamburg to change its name from Yoko Mono, as it has been known for 19 years, to the rather more dull and singular Mono. The name, the court was reported to have said, is so similar “that it was sufficiently likely that an observer would surmise some kind of link between Miss Ono and the bar”. An observer of the graffiti-covered dive bar possibly wouldn’t assume it was run by the mega-rich artist, but apparently that’s not the point. Here are some other celebrities who have had to fight for their good names.\nUri Geller v Pokémon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Uri Geller (the real one). Photograph: Bruno Bebert/EPA\n\n\nIn 1999, the illusionist complained that Nintendo’s Pokémon game had used his name and image for two of its monsters. “I wouldn’t have given permission for an aggressive and, in one case, evil character to be based on me,” said the spoon-bender.\nGladys Knight v her son\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Gladys Knight. Photograph: Cine Text/Sportsphoto Ltd./Allstar\n\n\nThe chain of Gladys Knight’s Chicken & Waffles restaurants, run by Shanga Hankerson, became a source of embarrassment to his mother after he was arrested for financial irregularities in 2016. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported earlier this year that Knight had won the case – and that her name, and anything associated with her, should be phased out.\nClint Eastwood v furniture\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Clint Eastwood … he and furniture have history. Photograph: The Washington Post/Getty Images\n\n\nThe actor took umbrage at a furniture company which, according to reports, was marketing a “Clint entertainment center”. The unit, said the company, virtually incomprehensibly, makes you look as if you live in “a perfect world of a million dollar baby” (bold, lawyer’s own).\nRosa Parks v Outkast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Rosa Parks being arrested.

Photograph: Canadian Press/REX\n\n\nIn the French novel La Première Chose Qu’on Regarde (The First Thing You See) by Grégoire Delacourt, one character is a Scarlett Johansson lookalike. The real Johansson was reportedly unhappy – her lawyers said the character was a “fraudulent and illicit exploitation of her name, her reputation and her image”. A French judge agreed it was defamatory, but awarded her just €2,500 in damages and €2,500 legal costs (much less than the €50,000 sought) and rejected her demand that it should not be translated. The English-language version was published in 2015.\nManuel Noriega v Call of Duty\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Manuel Noriega.

        "text": "\nThe home secretary has vowed to stem the flow of “dirty money” into the City of London in an attempt to end its reputation as a safe haven for “criminals and corrupt kleptocrats” to hide their money.\nAmber Rudd highlighted a National Crime Agency estimate that £90bn is laundered via London each year.\nRudd conceded that the UK has much more work to do to prevent financial crime, which she called a “national security threat” that costs the UK £24bn a year and undermines its reputation as a place to do business.\n“I’m deeply concerned by claims London is a major global money-laundering centre,” Rudd said at a conference hosted by the Financial Conduct Authority, the City regulator, on Thursday.\n“The UK is attractive to criminals and corrupt kleptocrats who steal billions from their own people, often some of the poorest people in the world. We will reduce the flow of dirty money into the City.”\nThe government last month unveiled its criminal finances bill, detailing measures to make London less attractive to international criminals as a place to launder money.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Amber Rudd. Photograph: Niklas Halle'N/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\nMeasures in the bill aimed at money laundering include new unexplained wealth orders, under which people suspected of trying to launder the proceeds of crime will be asked to explain the source of their money.\nIf they cannot, assets such as property can be seized to ensure criminals are unable to launder their cash by investing in property.\nRudd also said that an online raid in which hackers stole from thousands of Tesco Bank customers last weekend indicates the UK has yet to “make a dent” in the growing threat of cybercrime.\n“The recent events at Tesco Bank are a stark example of what we face,” she said.\n“It’s clear that for thousands of hard-working people [...] public confidence in our institutions gets shaken by this sort of event.\n“The [Tesco] incident served to demonstrate that the private sector has a crucial role and a responsibility in countering cyber-enabled fraud,” she added.\n\n\n\n\nTesco Bank cyber-thieves stole £2.5m from 9,000 people\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“While we have made some good progress and taken some significant steps forward, we haven’t yet put a dent in the problem. The threat remains great and there is very much more to be done.”\nThe FCA’s head of financial crime, Rob Gruppetta, hailed government efforts to tackle financial crime as a “positive step in the right direction”.\nBut he also proposed a series of measures that the regulator believes would beef up companies’ defences.\nThe measures include a centralised database of suspicious transactions, which could help firms save money on building their own systems and make it easier for them to share data with other firms and law enforcement agencies.\nGruppetta also said the government should rethink rules under which officials tasked with reporting suspected money laundering can be held criminally liable for failing to do so.\nHe said this could be doing “more harm than good” because it leads to overly conservative reporting. Rules that make banks legally liable if they share flawed information on financial crime with rival companies should also be relaxed, he said.\nThe FCA chief executive, Andrew Bailey, called on companies to make the UK a “hostile environment” for financial criminals by making better use of technology.\nThe regulator was ticked off by the Treasury select committee earlier this week for the lack of technical experts among its board of directors, particularly in the light of the hack of Tesco Bank.\n",

        "text": "\nTwo in the afternoon and I’m in a Ladbrokes on Caledonian Road in one of the grittier parts of north London. A few yards from a pawnbroker offering Cartier watches for a touch under £2,000, the bookmaker is one of four within 500 metres.\nPaddy Power recently opened the fourth betting shop in a former solicitors’ office after the proposal was initially rejected by Islington council, which feared that it would create a gambling cluster in a deprived area.\nThe government’s planning inspectorate overturned the council’s decision, despite acknowledging that “economically deprived neighbourhoods would be relatively more susceptible to the adverse financial, social and health impacts of problem gambling arising from significant clusters of betting shops”.\nA local police officer, asked to give evidence, explained that, while betting shops were used by the criminal fraternity to “waste their ill-gotten gains”, solicitors’ offices were more of a crime risk because they were attractive targets to the moped gangs that plague the area.\nThere seems little sign that the criminal fraternity is frequenting the Ladbrokes I’m in today. A few old boys are watching horse-racing but it’s stultifyingly quiet.\nThen two men in paint-spattered clothes come in and make for the four machines in the corner. One takes two £10 notes from his pocket and feeds them into a machine, selects a roulette game, one of at least 10 on offer, and presses the screen several times. The ball spins and the man steps back to watch its progress. He turns to his companion, shrugs, and selects some more numbers. He walks away, then returns with two more £10 notes. He repeats the exercise and then walks out of the shop. It has taken less than three minutes for him to lose £40.\nBut this is nothing.\nThe B2 fixed-odds betting terminal (FOBT) the man was playing is a category of machine that allows players to gamble £100 every 20 seconds in the hope of winning £500. Theoretically, this means a player could end up gambling £18,000 an hour, a figure frequently highlighted by a powerful coalition of MPs, church and industry lobby groups, which wants the machines, often described as “the crack cocaine” of gambling, brought under control.\n\n\n\n\nA stupid gamble on evil machines | Victoria Coren Mitchell\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile no one seems to have managed to blow £18,000 in 60 minutes, there is ample evidence of the machine’s addictive qualities. Seven gamblers lost more than £10,000 in a day on the terminals during a 10-month observation period, according to GambleAware. A report carried out by JP Morgan, the financial services firm, on behalf of Ladbrokes and William Hill, suggested that the average loss by a regular FOBT gambler is £1,200 a year. The Centre for Social Justice calculates that £1.7bn is being lost annually on the UK’s 34,809 FOBTs.\nAmid growing clamour for action, the government is edging towards reform. As the Observer reported, a reduced maximum stake is back on the cards, possibly as low as £2. This would be devastating for the bookmakers. Analysts at Barclays estimate that Ladbrokes would lose £449m in revenue if this were to happen. But if the stake were cut to only £25, Ladbrokes would lose just £87m. Small wonder that the bookmakers have been throwing everything they can against the proposals.\nTwo hours later at a Paddy Power betting shop in Chinatown in Soho, only yards from two Betfreds, a man sits at a terminal, staring intently at the screen while the largely Chinese clientele watch the horse-racing. He catches me looking at him. “Back off,” he mutters. Another man, playing the machine beside him, says something to him. “Be calm,” the first man snaps furiously. He’s shaking his head, sweating profusely, rubbing his nose. His gambling habit may not be his only addiction. He’s £400 or so in credit but several minutes later he has nothing. He walks out cursing loudly, eyes bulging.\nThe ubiquity of betting shops in Chinatown has alarmed residents’ groups. But the betting industry knows its market. Chinese people are enthusiastic gamblers. Deprived areas are targeted, too. The JP Morgan report revealed that 70% of FOBT gamblers were from the poorest, C2DE demographic.\nNot everyone who plays the machines is poor or addicted. At a William Hill in Soho a man dressed in pristine overalls and carrying a smart Oakley backpack feeds £10 notes into a machine. He appears to be losing, but his face is expressionless. After a while he cashes in, having lost a little. He takes a paper slip from the machine – confirming what is left of his stake – and approaches the kiosk where he can have the money wired electronically to his account. Half an hour later I see him do a similar thing at another nearby William Hill, this time having played two machines simultaneously. It’s a neat operation. He is down a bit but he has also found a home for a heap of cash.\nAccording to an assessment by the Gambling Commission, when it comes to money-laundering, B2 machines “pose the greatest product risk in the betting sector”.\nIt’s just after seven at a William Hill in north London where the friendly staff are offering punters free cups of tea and coffee. I am encouraged to play a demo of the roulette games for as long as I like before staking real cash, “so you can get the feel of it”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Free demos are provided in betting shops, and machines are designed to encourage continued playing. Photograph: Alamy\n\n\nThe demo suggests I’m winning. Buoyed by my success, I load £5 from my debit card. A few spins and I’ve lost my stake, having been in credit for much of the session. At one stage I had considered cashing in but the bet button was flashing irresistibly.\nIn the industry this is known as “choice architecture”: the use of design to encourage continued playing. Many want this architecture reformed – and a ban introduced on people loading machines using their debit cards. Prohibiting freebies might help, too. If I’d been in the shop at eight that morning, I would have had the chance to bag a £25 voucher to play the roulette games. “You have to get here early,” I’m told. “They go like hot cakes.”\nBut I cannot get excited about roulette. It’s so dull. “You’d be surprised,” the staff member says. “Some people sit here for hours.”\nMy attention turns to a man playing a slot machine game called Eye of Horus. This is a B3 game which has a maximum stake of £2.\nIn the cacophonous debate about FOBTs, no one talks about these machines. But in the 17 betting shops I visited on Thursday, more people were playing these slot machines than the B2s. B3 machines accept a new bet every 2.5 seconds and they offer a payback of 92%, compared with 97.3% for the B2s.\nDr Jonathan Parke, an expert on gaming, produced a report for GambleAware, an independent charity funded by the gambling industry, that looked at design features of both B2 and B3 machines. According to his calculations, if a £2 stake limit were introduced for the B2 machines, the average money lost per hour would be just under £10, against the current £468.\nYet people would still be free to lose £230 an hour on the B3 machines, according to Parke’s calculations. He fears many players would simply switch from B2 machines to B3 machines, which are probably more addictive because of the speed at which you can bet. However, Parke calculates that cutting the stake on B3 terminals from a maximum of £2 to 10p would reduce the average loss to £11.52, roughly in line with that on the B2 machines if the government imposed a £2 stake limit.\nStrangely, no one is pushing this line. Not the bookmakers whose shops also feature B3 machines. Nor those campaigning for reform, notably the all-party parliamentary group on fixed-odds betting terminals, which produced a report on them supported by, among others, Bacta, the association for the amusement and gaming machine industry, JD Wetherspoon and Hippodrome Casino, all of which make money from B3 machines.\n“Simply focusing on the size of the stake alone is a red herring,” said Parke. “If you want to stop people losing more money than they can afford, it’s not just the stake you need to look at but the game speed and payback percentage.”\nAndrew Margett, a former gambling addict turned vlogger, also wants broader reforms but of a different kind. He would like more spent on educating people about the risks of gambling. “Drugs, sex and alcohol get taught in schools – gambling should be also.”\nThe government is expected to announce what action it will take against FOBTs next month. But, given the powerful vested interests skewing the debate, it’s a near-certain bet that any reforms will be partial and narrow.\nTo put it another way, punters will still end up losing their shirt. But then they always have.\n",

        "text": "\nThe price of the virtual currency bitcoin has broken the $8,000 barrier for the first time, prompting speculation that it could soar past $10,000 by the end of the year.\nThe rise means one unit of the world’s first major cryptocurrency is now valued at more than six times an ounce of gold, traditionally seen as a safe-haven investment in times of economic turmoil.\n\n\n\n\nEverything you wanted to know about bitcoin but were afraid to ask\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBitcoin’s value is regularly volatile but despite several steep falls this year it has now surged tenfold from around $800 at the beginning of 2017 to more than $8,000 in the early hours of Friday morning.\nIts latest increase, a month after it broke through $5,000, is linked to speculation about the likelihood of a “hard fork” to create a spin-off currency.\nExpectations of a fork tend to boost bitcoin because when it happens, existing holders gain some of the new currency for free.\nBitcoin’s market price has been volatile lately after the cancellation of a technical upgrade known as SegWit2x, designed to increase transaction speeds.\nAccording to the cryptocurrency exchange CoinBase, a large number of bitcoin “miners” – people who provide the computational power that underpins bitcoin in exchange for the chance of financial reward – could now go ahead with their own upgrade. There is speculation that this could trigger a fork.\n\nbitcoin value chart\n\nLukman Otunuga, a research analyst at the foreign exchange broker FXTM, said: “I find it remarkable and somewhat frightening how, no matter how much bitcoin is pummelled by sellers, it simply bounces back even stronger.\n“Will bitcoin hit $10,000 before year end? This is the question every investor is asking.”\nNicholas Gregory, chief executive of the cryptocurrency business CommerceBlock, said there was more to bitcoin’s rise than speculation about a fork.\n“The cryptocurrency’s momentum is being driven by a growing sense among speculators that the banking industry is firmly in its crosshairs,” he said. “Increasingly, traders and speculators are looking at banks as Blockbuster Video and bitcoin as Netflix.”\n\n\n Q&A What is bitcoin and is it a bad investment?  \n\n\n Show \n\n\n Hide  \n\n\nBitcoin is the first, and the biggest, \"cryptocurrency\" – a decentralised tradable digital asset. Whether it is a bad investment is the big question. Bitcoin can only be used as a medium of exchange and in practice has been far more important for the dark economy than it has for most legitimate uses. The lack of any central authority makes bitcoin remarkably resilient to censorship, corruption – or regulation. That means it has attracted a range of backers, from libertarian monetarists who enjoy the idea of a currency with no inflation and no central bank, to drug dealers who like the fact that it is hard (but not impossible) to trace a bitcoin transaction back to a physical person.\n\n\n\n\nWas this helpful?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you for your feedback.\n\n\n\n\nBitcoin has proved particularly controversial, with financial pundits divided over its stability and long-term prospects. Jamie Dimon, the JP Morgan chief executive, has branded it a “fraud” fit only for drug dealers, murderers and people living in places such as North Korea\nChina banned bitcoin exchanges this year, sending the currency’s value tumbling more than 40% from $5,000 to below $3,000.\nVladimir Putin, the Russian president, has called for regulation of cryptocurrencies, saying their use “bears serious risks” such as money laundering, tax evasion and funding for terrorism. \nBitcoin was launched in 2009 after being invented by Satoshi Nakamoto, believed to a pseudonym for multiple developers. Within three years it had achieved parity with the dollar, and it has surged, amid periods of intense volatility, ever since. \n",

        "text": "\nGambling firms that fail to tackle problem gambling and money laundering face heftier fines and a higher risk of losing their operating licence under a tougher regime to be unveiled by the industry’s regulator.\nThe Gambling Commission will lay out its new enforcement strategy this month, detailing how bookmakers, casinos and online gaming companies who are deemed to have breached regulations will be punished. The new stance follows a year in which several major bookmakers reached voluntary settlements for failing to prevent money laundering or problem gambling.\n\n\n\n\n'Poker was like being in a trance': readers' experiences of problem gambling\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe regulator has yet to publish the details of its harsher regime but chief executive Sarah Harrison recently warned gambling firms to expect tougher policing to ensure they were not used for money laundering and “terrorist financing”. In a speech to senior figures in the industry, Harrison said the regulator’s recent work had uncovered “a lack of curiosity, and at worst, a leadership culture which puts commercial gain over compliance”.\nShe said the commission would abandon the “blanket approach” of reaching settlements with firms that transgress and would be more likely to review their licence to operate in the UK.\n“We will put all access to all tools, including licence review [...] on an equal footing. Parliament gave us a wide range of regulatory tools for a reason,” she said, adding that sanctions were likely to include “higher penalties”, particularly when a company was guilty of “repeated failings”.\nHarrison, who took over as the commission’s chief executive in 2015, has repeatedly signalled her intention to run a stricter regime than predecessors. She called on companies to “raise your ambitions and your sights higher”, urging them to “step up the pace of change” before the publication of the new enforcement strategy.\nShe said that the regulator would not allow companies to spend months negotiating settlement deals, where they agreed to a voluntary payment when they misbehaved. Last year, the commission arranged voluntary settlements with bookmakers such as Paddy Power, which agreed to pay £280,000 after it was found to have encouraged a problem gambler until he lost five jobs, his home and access to his children.\nBetfred reached an £800,000 settlement in June after admitting it had failed to implement proper anti-money laundering controls in accepting stolen cash from a “VIP” custom. In a similar case, the regulator announced an £880,000 settlement with Coral in April, after the bookmaker took hundreds of thousands of pounds from a “VIP” problem gambler who was using the proceeds of theft to feed his habit.\nHarrison told gambling firms that the process of agreeing these voluntary payments was too “drawn out”. “To create better incentives for early settlement, we will also be consulting on introducing time-limited settlements,” she said.\n\n\n\n\nThe big gamble: the dangerous world of British betting shops – podcast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis would mean firms who drag their feet in reaching a settlement with the regulator will have to pay more than if they agree an immediate payout. The industry’s trade body, the Association of British Bookmakers, said it welcomed any efforts to uphold high standards of integrity.\n“As a sector, we are always ready to work with the commission to raise standards and adhere not just to the regulatory and legal frameworks in place, but to the commitments in our responsible gambling code which go beyond that. Clearly if there are failures that continue or are not addressed then it is right to take action,” said the ABB. \nLabour MP Carolyn Harris, who chairs a cross-party group of MPs looking into the impact of fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) applauded the tighter regime, but said the regulator should throw its weight behind curbs on the controversial machines, which allow gamblers to stake up to £100 every 20 seconds.\n“I welcome this action from the Gambling Commission, but I implore the commission and the government to take immediate action to properly address the harm being done in communities across the country by the high stakes being waged on fixed odds betting terminals. Only by substantially reducing the maximum stake will we stop the harm being caused by these machines which have been called the ‘crack cocaine’ of gambling.”\nThe group of MPs, whose financial backers include casinos, the trade body for amusement arcades and pubs firm JD Wetherspoon, is due to publish a final report on FOBTs at the end of this month.\nIn an interim report published in December, the group urged the government to limit the maximum stake on the machines to £2.\n",

        "text": "\nDavid Cameron said it when he was prime minister, and the Labour MP Margaret Hodge has now made the same point. When it comes to cleaning up tax havens, sunlight is the best disinfectant.\nIt was at the G8 summit in 2013 that Cameron first called for transparency. He urged the governments of the UK’s network of offshore centres, which spreads from the Caribbean to the Channel, to make public the names of those individuals hiding behind shell companies incorporated on their shores. His efforts were frustrated by lobbying from the offshore industry, including Appleby, the law firm at the centre of the Paradise Papers.\nFour years and three big data leaks later, the British government has yet to push through this reform. Files from HSBC’s Swiss bank, and then from the Panama firm Mossack Fonseca, exposed an orgy of tax dodging, money laundering and corruption. \n\n\n\n\nTackle tax avoidance in budget, Labour urges Philip Hammond\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Paradise Papers leak shows offshore activity is continuing, even escalating. At an emergency debate on tax avoidance and evasion held in the House of Commons on Tuesday, MPs on both sides called once more for the government to act on transparency. Those calls are becoming increasingly difficult to resist.\nHodge, who put tax avoidance on the political map in her time as chair of the public accounts committee, took no prisoners as she opened the debate. Describing Bono as a “self-appointed philanthropist”, she asked whether the rock star, who has a cameo in the Paradise Papers, would have used tax havens if he had thought we would all find out. The Queen’s financial advisers will now be asking themselves the same question.\nThe government does have the power to legislate for change in those territories that recognise the British monarch as their head of state, and her privy council as their supreme court. It has used those powers before, to outlaw discrimination against gay people and to end capital punishment. \n\n\n\n\nParadise Papers: who's who in the leak of offshore secrets\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Conservative MP Andrew Mitchell agreed with Hodge. He believes the time has come for the government to act on public registers. In Tuesday’s debate, he suggested measures could be included in the forthcoming finance bill, which is expected to pass next year.\nThose havens that embraced openness would get first-mover advantage, he predicted, by attracting the lion’s share of the legitimate offshore business. If such arguments cannot convince Britain’s tax havens to open their own shutters, Mitchell believes Westminster should use its powers to let in the light. As a former chief whip and Treasury representative, his words carry weight. \nShould the prime minister fail to act, she risks looking complicit in wrongdoing.\n",

        "text": "\nThe cartoonist Ramón Esono Ebalé, arrested in Equatorial Guinea earlier this year, may share the same planet as the writer Neil Gaiman. But according to the latter, they “live in different worlds”.\n“I am perfectly free to write whatever I wish, to be as imaginative as I want to be, to create people and places, to challenge the things that I believe need to be challenged, and you are not,” Gaiman declared in a letter to the imprisoned cartoonist. “It is the truth of the worlds that you and I occupy, but it is something that I do not and cannot accept.”\nGaiman is part of a group of international artists and writers, including Ai Weiwei, Kamila Shamsie and Madeleine Thien, who have written letters of hope to imprisoned writers around the world to mark PEN International’s Day of the Imprisoned Writer on Wednesday. According to PEN, Ebalé was arrested in the capital of Equatorial Guinea on 16 September 2017. Security agents initially questioned him about cartoons criticising President Obiang and other government officials, before sending him to prison while investigations were conducted into allegations of money laundering and counterfeiting. He has yet to be formally charged with any offence.\nIn his letter, Gaiman explained that he was writing “because I need you to know that PEN’s entire community of writers, artists and activists, stands with you. Those who are threatened by your work have tried to silence you, and instead they have amplified your voice. We are with you in your struggle for freedom. And we will continue to stand with you until you are free to carry out your work without fear.”\nWriting to the Syrian blogger Razan Zaitouneh, a human rights defender who PEN says was abducted by armed men in 2013, Shamsie echoed Gaiman’s words.\n“Those who’ve abducted you might have thought they could shut you up, but your lessons echo so powerfully and will continue to do so,” Shamsie wrote. “We are not giving up – on you, and on everything you stand for. I hope one day, after you’re returned to your family, I’ll have a chance to meet you … I hope the moon is shining strong on your face. And I know that one day, in part because of the work and example of you and your colleagues, the darkness will lift entirely.”\nAi wrote his letter to the poet and artist Zehra Doğan, who is imprisoned in Turkey for “propagandising for a terrorist organisation” in her work as a painter and journalist. Calling for her immediate and unconditional release, Ai wrote: “If a state can sentence an artist, journalist or writer in such a fashion then we are truly living in a dark age where no ideas or creativity can be protected and flourish … Only societies that protect freedom of speech and expression can meet the challenges presented by globalisation and have any chance of a positive future.”\nThien wrote to the blogger Nguyễn Ngọc Như Quỳnh, who has been sentenced to 10 years in prison for “conducting propaganda against the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam”. Thien’s letter said: “I do not know if you know that, around the world, your trial and sentencing caused outrage and heartache, and your case was seen as an egregious example of the Vietnamese government using imprisonment (and consequent separation of families) to punish civil and peaceful discourse. You have shown in your writing and life a commitment to all of us – in Vietnam and outside – in your struggle to protect the basic rights on which we all depend. That your rights were denied – a fair trial, due process, and freedom of expression – is a devastating injustice we now have the responsibility to confront.”\nThe Mexican poet Homero Aridjis sent his letter to Cesario Padilla, who was convicted of “usurpation” at the National Autonomous University of Honduras in June. Aridjis praised Padilla for “having the courage to raise your voice in a country where criminals act with impunity, and where human rights go unprotected.” \nHe added: “When I was the international president of PEN, after receiving death threats, I spent a year in Mexico with official bodyguards. I know what it means to live in the shadows because of a justified fear. Having been a student leader, and now being an independent journalist, it is the same for you, now that you are exposed to intimidation and reprisals. I want you to know that your fellow writers, in more than 100 countries around the world, stand in solidarity with you.”\n\n",

        "text": "\nThe European parliament has raised “serious concerns” about democracy and the rule of law in Malta after the assassination of the high-profile investigative journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia.\nIn a sharply critical resolution backed by two-thirds of MEPs, the European parliament urged EU authorities to open a dialogue with Malta on the rule of law, a formal process the European commission has embarked on with Poland.\n “Developments in Malta in recent years have led to serious concerns about the rule of law, democracy and fundamental rights, including freedom of the media and the independence of the police and the judiciary,” stated the text by European lawmakers, which was passed with 466 out of a possible 751 votes. \nMEPs have also accused Maltese police of failing to investigate “several serious allegations of corruption and breach of anti-money laundering and banking supervision obligations”, describing this as “a threat to the rule of law in this member state”.\n\n\n\n\nMalta car bomb kills Panama Papers journalist\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe resolution was passed a day after the European parliament in Strasbourg named a press room after Caruana Galizia, a mark of honour to the journalist, who was killed by a car bomb last month. \nCaruana Galizia’s immediate family attended a ceremony led by the European parliament’s president, Antonio Tajani. “Daphne never grew cynical, she grew more outraged and frustrated and with every story that she broke her readership grew large and her readers more loyal,” her husband, Peter Caruana Galizia, told an audience of MEPs and journalists at the ceremony, according to the Times of Malta.\nThe latest resolution does not compel EU authorities to act but raises pressure on the European commission to monitor democratic standards in the EU’s smallest member state. \nThe EU has always struggled to police internal standards within member states, but has begun to confront democratic backsliding since the commission opened an unprecedented investigation into the rule of law in Poland. Both Poland and Hungary have also been subject to MEP resolutions, criticising Poland’s changes to its judicial system and Hungary’s treatment of asylum seekers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Daphne Caruana Galizi was killed on 16 October. Photograph: Jon Borg/AP\n\n\nIn a separate resolution, MEPs on Wednesday stepped up criticism of Poland’s government over changes to its constitutional court, rebuking Warsaw for not moving to a compromise over changes it said “undermine judicial independence and weaken the rule of law in Poland”.\nThe commission has urged Maltese authorities to “leave no stone unturned” to find the perpetrators of the “barbarous assassination” of Caruana Galizia. \nIn the latest resolution MEPs also raise the alarm about  the sale of Maltese passports to the super-rich, meaning that any wealthy person can buy the right to free movement and protections of EU citizenship.\n\n\n\n\nThe billionaires investing in Cyprus in exchange for EU passports\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing questions from MEPs, Timmermans confirmed the European commission was investigating the “so-called sale of passports” across the EU and would publish a full report in 2018. \nMalta is not the only EU member state offering wealthy individuals the right to settle for a payment. The UK grants permanent residence to people offering to invest £2m in the country under the “tier 1 investor visa” scheme. People with permanent residence can later apply for citizenship.\nThe issue is pertinent for Brussels as holding one EU passport confers the right to live and work in 27 other member states. “Member states should use their prerogatives with citizenship in line with their EU and international obligations,” Timmermans said.\nMalta, with a population of 434,000, has a disproportionately large financial centre, where some companies have been found to pay as little as 5% corporation tax, far below the headline rate. \nIn the European parliament debate on Tuesday, several MEPs criticised Malta’s “hyper-low taxation”. The French Green MEP Eva Joly, vice-chair of the parliament’s special committee on the Panama papers, said tax rules in Malta had to be changed because they were “undermining European cohesion”.\n Last month 20 member states signed an agreement to create a European public prosecutor’s office to tackle the most difficult cross-border crimes. Malta was among the minority that declined to take part.\n The resolution was expected to pass as it had the support of groups representing almost two-thirds of MEPs, from the centre-right European People’s party to the radical left and greens. \n\n",

        "text": "\nManuel Noriega, the former Panamanian dictator whose regime was marked by brutal repression, ultimately disastrous collusion with the CIA and the establishment of “the hemisphere’s first narcokleptocracy”, has died at the age of 83.\n\n\n\n\nManuel Noriega – a life in pictures\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHis death, late on Monday, was announced on Tuesday by the president of the central American country.\nJuan Carlos Varela tweeted: “The death of Manuel A Noriega closes a chapter in our history; his daughters and their families deserve to bury him in peace.”\n\n\nJuan Carlos Varela \n(@JC_Varela)\nMuerte de Manuel A. Noriega cierra un capítulo de nuestra historia; sus hijas y sus familiares merecen un sepelio en paz.\n\nMay 30, 2017\n\n\nNoriega had been put into an induced coma in March after undergoing brain surgery. A government official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Noriega died at about 11pm local time after his condition suddenly worsened.\nNoriega ruled Panama from 1983 to 1989, spying for the CIA before the US invaded in 1989, toppling his repressive regime and ending a drug-trafficking career that associated him with the Colombian kingpin Pablo Escobar.\nWith the knowledge of US officials, Noriega formed “the hemisphere’s first narcokleptocracy”, a US Senate subcommittee report said, describing him as “the best example in recent US foreign policy of how a foreign leader is able to manipulate the United States to the detriment of our own interests”. \nAurelio Barria, who led the Cruzada Civilista (Civil Crusade) opposition movement that staged many street protests against Noriega’s regime, said the dictator’s death “ends a period that we should try not to forget so it is not repeated in Panama”.Carolina Cruz, a 65-year-old housewife out shopping in the capital, told the Associated Press that his demise “leaves open wounds”, adding: “Many died during his government, but he had deteriorated a lot and served many years in prison.”\n\n\n\n\nManuel Noriega - from US friend to foe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLike many authoritarian Latin American figures of the latter half of the 20th century, Noriega was trained at the notorious, US-run School of the Americas, whose graduates include the disgraced former Peruvian spy chief Vladimiro Montesinos and the former Argentinian dictator Leopoldo Galtieri.\nHe joined Panama’s defence forces in 1962 and rose steadily through the ranks, mainly through loyalty to his mentor, Gen Omar Torrijos, who became Panama’s de facto leader after a coup in 1968.\nAs Torrijos’s intelligence chief, Noriega monitored political opponents and developed close ties with US intelligence agencies guarding against possible threats to the Panama canal. \nTwo years after Torrijos died in a mysterious plane crash in 1981, Noriega became the head of the armed forces and Panama’s de facto ruler. He was considered a valued CIA asset, helping the US seize drugs at sea and track money laundering in Panama’s banks, and reporting on guerrilla and terrorist activities.\nHis relationship with Washington eventually turned toxic, especially after a top political opponent was killed in 1985 and Noriega appeared to join forces with Latin American drug traffickers. \nHis foes in the Panamanian military made several coup attempts but failed, and their leaders were summarily executed by firing squad. \nThe beginning of his downfall came in 1988 when federal grand juries in the Florida cities of Miami and Tampa indicted Noriega on drug-trafficking charges.\nInitially he reacted with defiance, thumbing his nose at US economic sanctions designed to drive him from power. He famously waved a machete at a rally while vowing not to leave, and in 1989 he nullified elections that observers say were easily won by the opposition.\nThe US president George HW Bush ordered the invasion of Panama in December 1989, and Noriega was captured and taken to Miami. During the operation, 23 US military personnel died and 320 were wounded, and the Pentagon estimated 200 Panamanian civilians and 314 soldiers were killed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  A defiant Noriega in Panama in October 1989, and in captivity in Miami in January 1990. Photograph: DSK/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\nProsecutors accused Noriega of helping Colombia’s Medellín cocaine cartel ship “tonnes and tonnes of a deadly white powder” to the US. The defence cited court documents describing him as the “CIA’s man in Panama” and argued that the indictment “smells all the way from here to Washington”.\nIn April 1992, jurors convicted Noriega on eight of 10 charges. On the judge’s instructions, they were told not to consider the political side of the case, including whether the US had the right to invade Panama and bring Noriega to trial in the first place.\nDuring his years at a minimum-security federal prison outside Miami, Noriega was afforded special treatment and was allowed to wear his Panamanian military uniform and insignia when in court. He lived in a bungalow apart from other inmates and had his own television and exercise equipment. He was said to be an avid follower of the news and a voracious reader about politics and current events.\nAfter completing his 17-year sentence in 2007, Noriega was extradited to France and received a seven-year sentence for money laundering.\nPanama wanted Noriega to return to face in-absentia convictions and two prison terms of 20 years for embezzlement, corruption and murder of opponents, including the military commander Moises Giroldi, who led a failed rebellion on 3 October 1989, and Hugo Spadafora, whose decapitated body was found in a mailbag on the border with Costa Rica in 1985. In mid-2011, France approved his extradition to Panama.\nDespite amassing great wealth, Noriega had worked hard to cultivate an image of a man of the people. “The humble, the poor, the blacks, they are the utmost authority,” Noriega said in one speech. He lived in a modest, two-storey home in an upper-middle-class neighbourhood in Panama City that stood in stark contrast with the opulent mansions customary among Latin American dictators.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Noriega walks with supporters in the Chorrilo neighbourhood of Panama City in 1989. Photograph: John Hopper/AP\n\n\n“He would only say ‘hello’ very respectfully,” said German Sánchez, who lived next door for 16 years. “You may think what you like of Noriega, but we can’t say he was anything but respectful toward his neighbours.”\nWhile resentment lingers over the US invasion, Noriega has so few supporters in modern-day Panama that attempts to auction off his old home attracted no bidders and the government decided to demolish the decaying building. Late in life, he had zero influence over his country from behind bars.\nNoriega broke a long silence in June 2015 when he made a statement from prison on Panamanian television in which he asked for forgiveness from those harmed by his regime. He apologised to anybody who “felt offended, affected, hurt or humiliated by my actions”, adding: “I feel that as Christians we all have to forgive. The Panamanian people have already overcome this period of dictatorship.”\nFor the most part, however, Noriega remained silent about the elite military and civilian associates who prospered through the corruption he helped create, and which still plagues the central American nation, a favoured trans-shipment point for drugs and a haven for money laundering.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Noriega begins his three-month house arrest at his daughter’s house in Panama City on 28 January.

        "text": "\nFor years the International Olympic Committee has insisted the wild west era of the late 1990s, when members’ votes were bought for vast sums during feverish races to host the Games, were a distant memory. But who would believe that now?\nHow could they when Carlos Arthur Nuzman, the head of Rio’s 2016 Olympic bid, stands accused of orchestrating a scheme where members of the IOC were paid bungs days before the vote?\nOr, as the Guardian revealed last year, after the Tokyo Olympics bid team made secret €1.3m payments to the Black Tidings bank account in Singapore, which is associated with the same notorious fixer who is accused of using illegitimate means to help Rio?\nThe levels of largesse appear smaller nowadays than during the bad old days, before the behaviour of Salt Lake City’s bid team during the 2002 Winter Olympics vote led to wholesale changes in how the IOC awarded the Olympics. But the whiff of corruption nowadays carries a familiar aroma.\n\n\n\n\nLondon 2012 team insist bid for right to host Olympics was clean\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter our Tokyo story we received a message from a source with a close knowledge of the various investigations taking place. “Black Tidings is just a tiny part of one of the most corrupted networks in the history of sport,” they wrote, matter-of-factly. With each fresh revelation the impression there are more dodgy practices and individuals yet to be unearthed is strengthened. The intriguing question is where the story goes next.\nAlready, the reports are damning enough for the IOC. Brazilian prosecutors say the businessman Arthur César de Menezes Soares Filho deposited $2m into bank accounts belonging to the former IAAF marketing executive Papa Massata Diack, whose influence among certain countries is legendary, three days before the vote to decide who would host the 2016 Games.\nThey say the fee was paid at the behest of the former Rio de Janiero governor Sérgio Cabral, who was sentenced to 14 years in prison in June on bribery and money laundering charges. However, he is unlikely to be the only person facing jail given prosecutors say they have “vast documentation and robust evidence” Brazilian officials bribed Lamine Diack, the president of the IAAF between 1999 and 2015.\nThe federal prosecutor Fabiana Schneider said: “Nuzman was the bridge that linked the criminal scheme together ... he was greasing the wheels to organise the payment of bribes from Cabral directly to African members of the IOC, which was done via Arthur Soares.”\nThere was a crucial addendum. Schneider went on to say Diack Sr was influential with those African members. If anything, his son, Papa, was even more important when it came to ensuring votes for major sporting events were delivered, especially for those with the money and willingness to deal in the darker arts of the bidding process.\n\n\n\n\nRio Games vote-winner questioned by police over ‘rigged bidding process’\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome sources do not believe Diack Jr was motivated primarily by cash, having married into significant wealth in Senegal, but rather for the immense power and prestige that came with being known as a major global power broker. By happy coincidence, his various wheelings and dealings made him very rich indeed.\nAt the IAAF, Diack Jr was able to cream off money from contracts as well as taking money from Russians to make positive drug tests disappear. It was for his part in extorting €450,000 from the Russian marathon runner Liliya Shobukhova to cover up her doping violations that he was banned from athletics for life. For many who dealt with him on a day-to-day basis, his behaviour meant that particular judgment had been coming for a while. One source describes him as “a pig and a thug”. People shake their heads when talking about how he was allowed to get away with what he did at the IAAF for so long – the answer is because his father was the president.\nDiack Jr also had a lucrative sideline in securing African votes for cities bidding for the IAAF world championships and Olympic Games. As one observer told the Guardian: “Papa was available to everybody to do anything – for the right price.”\nIn the hotel bars and lobbies where sports politicians congregate and unwind, Papa was known as a fixer with a dubious reputation. He would tell interested parties that if they wanted to hire him, they would need to provide a certain amount of money for fees, expenses and presents and parcels for voters. Often there was a sting in the tail, with potential clients also being warned: “If you don’t do the deal with me, I will do it for someone else and I will fuck you up.”\n\n\n\n\nIOC selective blindness continues but Rio 2016 scandal looks all too familiar | Marina Hyde\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrench prosecutors allege Diack Jr received $2m from a British Virgin Islands company linked to Soares three days before the vote for the 2016 Olympics. His company, Pamodzi Sports Consulting, then transferred $299,300 to the offshore company Yemli Limited, which was linked to the former Olympic sprinter Frankie Fredericks, who was an IOC scrutineer at the vote in Copenhagen. Fredericks, who denies any wrongdoing, is awaiting the conclusion of an ethics investigation against him.\nDiack’s father, Lamine, preferred to operate in the shadows. Many in the IAAF had no idea he was corrupt until the French police arrested him in November 2015 for accepting more than €1m to cover up positive drugs tests. According to two sources who spoke to the New York Times, since then they have also found a secret bank account where money from the Brazil bid was funnelled to him.\nLast year, the Guardian revealed the presence of a secret email that suggested Diack Sr was working as a “special adviser” to help Qatar try to win the Olympics as far back as 2011. And that six individuals, referred to only by their initials but corresponding with six members of the IOC at the time, had requested “to have their parcels delivered through Special Adviser in Monaco” to support this bid.\nThe Guardian understands some of these individuals are still part of the IOC executive committee.\nThe corruption might be wider still. There was a reason the Diacks had a business that went on operating year in and year out – people knew it worked – and that the money given to them must have been delivered to those pledging their votes.\nLast year, the IOC president, Thomas Bach, insisted his organisation had “all rules and instruments in place to fight corruption with zero tolerance”, yet he has shown no great enthusiasm to get to the bottom of the scandal.\nHowever, there is hope among some in international sport that the French police may be about to step up their efforts to bring more of those involved to justice. According to this line of thinking, once Paris’s candidacy for the 2024 Olympics is confirmed in Lima next week, there will be no political reasons not to target potentially corrupt IOC members.\nThere is also an expectation Tokyo’s bid for the 2020 Games will be scrutinised more closely too. After all, the holder of the Black Tidings account, Ian Tan Tong Han, a close associate of Diack Jr, was said by a Wada independent commission report into corruption at the IAAF to be employed by a Lucerne-based company called Athletics Management & Services as a consultant. AMS was contracted by the Japanese media and marketing giant Dentsu.\nMight other Olympic bids have been manipulated by the Diacks? Given what we now know about the corruption at Samsung – the biggest company in South Korea and a major Olympic sponsor – can we be sure about the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang? Or that the Diacks did not use their influence in other sports?\nAt least the pair will not be around to do more damage. Diack Jr is the subject of an Interpol red notice but remains in Senegal, where authorities have said they will not deport him.\nDiack Sr is expected to face trial early next year on charges of money laundering and corruption. Others remain in the shadows – holding their breath, and their wallets, tight.\n",

        "text": "\nA defendant in the Fifa corruption trial was accused of intimidating a key government witness, just hours after a former Argentinian football official killed himself following an accusation in court on Tuesday that he had taken millions in bribes.\nPlunging the US trial of three former Fifa officials deeper into controversy, federal prosecutors on Wednesday accused Manuel Burga, the former head of Peru’s football association, of making a “slicing motion across his throat” directed at Alejandro Burzaco, a former sports marketing executive who has confessed to paying tens of millions of dollars in bribes to senior Fifa officials.\n\n\n\n\nFormer official kills himself hours after bribery accusations in Fifa trial\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the past two days, Burzaco has been laying out in a New York City courtroom a detailed set of corruption allegations against the three men on trial he claims to have bribed over a period of years.\nProsecutors said they had witnessed Burga make the slicing motions twice during proceedings on Tuesday and Wednesday morning and requested he be placed in jail for the rest of the trial after Burzaco had broken down on the stand earlier in the day.\nBurga’s attorney, Bruce Udolf, said his client had been “simply itching” his throat due to dermatitis and characterized him as “gentle, meek, timid man”.\nBut the US district court judge Pamela Chen ordered Burga be placed “effectively on lockdown” under house arrest and revoked his access to phone and computers. \nThe trial is already taking place under heightened security after Chen expressed concerns about witness intimidation before proceedings began. The federal investigation into global corruption at Fifa has resulted in over 40 indictments of senior football officials and marketing executives, with 23 so far pleading guilty. \nDuring tense exchanges on Wednesday evening, Udolf argued that Burzaco had broken down earlier in the day due to the suicide in Buenos Aires on Tuesday, rather than intimidation in the courtroom. Chen replied: “You call it a suicide. No one knows that for sure.” \nJorge Delhon, 52, who authorities say killed himself on Tuesday evening, was a former lawyer for Argentina’s Football for All, a government programme that holds broadcast rights to domestic football in the country. Earlier on Tuesday, Burzaco had told the court he had paid Delhon and another Argentinian official annual $500,000 bribes between 2011 and 2014 for the marketing rights to domestic Argentinian football games. \nThe death was announced by police in Buenos Aires hours after the allegations were made. The lawyer’s body was found near train tracks with a suicide note, according to the Associated Press. \nThe three former officials on trial – Burga; Juan Ángel Napout, the Paraguayan former president of South American football’s governing body, Conmebol; and José Maria Marin, the former head of Brazil’s football confederation – deny multiple counts of racketeering, wire fraud and money laundering.\nDuring testimony on Wednesday, Burzaco said he had paid Burga a total of $3.6m in bribes; Marin $2.7m; and Naput $4.5m while he was CEO of the dominant South American media company Torneos y Competencias. The money had come in exchange for the marketing rights to major regional tournaments. \nThe former executive gave tearful testimony as he recounted the moment he turned himself in to US authorities shortly after a raid on a hotel in Zurich in May 2015, where the US government’s sprawling investigation into corruption at Fifa was announced. \nHe claimed his brother, a law enforcement official in Argentina, informed him police in Buenos Aires wanted to “shut me down” to “make it possible not to say anything in the US … This included killing me,” he said. \nBurzaco had signed a plea agreement with US prosecutors, including the forfeiture of $21.7m in assets and the forced sale of his stake in Torneos y Competencias. In exchange, he said, prosecutors would inform Chen of his cooperation and recommend him for a special informant visa allowing him to work in the US. \n“I’m hoping not to go to prison,” Burzaco, who has not been sentenced, said. \nBurzaco’s evidence has implicated a host of influential football officials for taking multiple bribes in exchange for marketing rights to regional competitions. Burzaco has also said well-known sports broadcasters, including Fox Sports, paid bribes to football officials. Fox Sports denies wrongdoing.\nOn Tuesday, Burzaco alleged that Julio Grondona, a former head of the Argentinian football association and a senior vice-president at Fifa, had taken at least $1m in bribes to vote for Qatar to host the 2022 World Cup.\nThe witness is due to be cross-examined by defense attorneys on Thursday. The trial is expected to last up to six weeks, with other co-operating witnesses expected to testify. \n",

        "text": "\nA former Argentinian football official killed himself just hours after he was accused of taking bribes by a witness in the New York corruption trial examining endemic misconduct at world football’s governing body, Fifa.\nJorge Delhon, 52, a lawyer who worked for Argentina’s Football for All, a government programme that holds the broadcast rights to domestic football in the country, was accused of accepting annual $500,000 (£380,000) bribes from 2011 to 2014.\n\n\n\n\nFifa official took bribes to back Qatar's 2022 World Cup bid, court hears\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sworn allegations were made by Alejandro Burzaco, an influential former sports marketing executive, who has pleaded guilty to corruption charges and has been assisting US authorities in the sprawling investigation into Fifa.\nBurzaco claimed to have agreed the bribes with Delhon and another Argentinian official to receive broadcast rights to domestic club competitions. Shortly after he made the allegations in court on Tuesday, police in Buenos Aires announced that Delhon had killed himself.\nThe trial of three former South American football executives continued on Wednesday. As Burzaco prepared to give a second day of testimony, he broke down in tears on the witness stand and was escorted from the courtroom.\nLawyers for Juan Ángel Napout, the Paraguayan former president of South American football’s governing body, Conmebol, accused someone in the courtroom of “staring down” the former executive.\nNapout, Manuel Burga, the former head of the Peruvian football association, and José Maria Marin, the head of Brazil’s football confederation, all deny multiple counts of racketeering, wire fraud and money laundering.\nAs Wednesday’s proceedings commenced, Burzaco continued to give details of how he orchestrated multimillion-dollar bribe payments to obtain the exclusive marketing rights to the Copa América tournament, contested between national teams, for a company, Datisa, created to house a group of rival sports marketing corporations, including Burzaco’s own Torneos y Competencias.\nBurzaco said he had agreed to pay $16.5m to a group of senior Conmebol officials to secure the rights. The deal allowed Datisa the rights to the 2015 tournament and the next two editions of the event. The $16.5m bribe payment would be repeated for the next two Copa Americas, and the contract would allow Datisa first refusal for rights in the future.\nThe Argentinian national, who turned himself in to authorities weeks after a May 2015 morning raid on a hotel in Zurich unveiled the federal investigation into Fifa, said the Copa América contract was finalised during a trip to London in May 2013.\nBurzaco said he had travelled to the UK for the Champions League final, which was held at Wembley Stadium, and met with a number of Conmebol officials at venues including the Waldorf Hilton hotel and a restaurant in Mayfair, in an attempt to get their signatures for the new contract.\nBurzaco recalled the details of one meeting at the Waldorf with Marin and Marco Polo Del Nero, a Fifa executive and now the current president of the Brazilian football confederation. The pair, who were due to receive $3m in bribes for the first Copa América, were angry they had not yet been paid a separate $2m annual bribe for the rights to the top South American club tournament, the Copa Libertadores. The bribes, Burzaco said were “normally paid in the first six months of the year” but had not yet reached the two officials.\nThe Copa Libertadores annual bribe was later paid to the two, Burzaco said.\nBurzaco’s evidence has implicated a host of influential football officials for taking multiple bribes in exchange for marketing rights to regional competitions. Burzaco has also said well known sports broadcasters, including Fox Sports, paid bribes to football officials. Fox Sports denies wrongdoing.\nOn Tuesday Burzaco, alleged that Julio Grondona, the late former head of the Argentinian FA and a senior vice-president at Fifa, had taken at least $1m in bribes to vote for Qatar to host the 2022 World Cup.\nThe trial is expected to last up to six weeks.\nIn the US, the National Suicide Prevention Hotline is 1-800-273-8255. In the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is on 13 11 14.\n",

        "text": "\nSecurity passes for 300 staff providing services for the lounge areas at Heathrow have been suspended against the backdrop of a police investigation into alleged fraud linked to passes.\nTwo women, aged 20 and 24, were arrested on 28 July and bailed until November on suspicion of fraud and money laundering, Scotland Yard said on Wednesday.\nSodexo, a contractor at the airport, subsequently confirmed that the airside passes of around 300 employees were suspended as “as a precautionary measure”.\nThe company said that the move was part of an ongoing investigation and that it was unable to provide further comment. The staff are believed to include cleaners and caterers.\nPolice said other matters had arisen since the arrests, which are believed to relate to airside security passes at Heathrow – one of the busiest airports in the world. The concern is believed to be around the processing of passes, according to Sky News.\nHowever, Scotland Yard said there was “no evidence that airside passes have been sold”.\nA Metropolitan police spokeswoman confirmed two women had been arrested. “They have been arrested in relation to an allegation that money has been fraudulently taken from a bank account,” she said. \n“Other matters have come to light during the inquiries and form part of the ongoing investigation.”\nPermanent and temporary passes are provided to flight crews, baggage handlers and a range of other staff working at Heathrow, which has around 70,000 workers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  The airport has around 70,000 workers. Photograph: Daniel Leal-Olivas/PA\n\n\nTighter checks for airport staff and stronger restrictions on access to sensitive areas were introduced in 2002 following two multi-million pound robberies at the airport. Current vetting require applicants for airside passes to provide five years’ employment references without gaps.\nAlthough there is no indication that the arrests and the suspension of the airside passes are in any way terror-related, they come at a time when concerns about airport security have been brought into sharp focus once again in the wake of the attack on Brussels airport earlier this year.\nAviation security in the UK is under constant review, according to the Department for Transport, while an increased police presence at Heathrow is believed to have been in place for some time.\nAs recently as last month, a transport minister said that the government was taking “all steps necessary to keep the public safe” after a threat was reportedly made against the airport.\nAn alert from non-governmental counter-terrorism organisation Site Intelligence Group warned of a threat being made by a “pro-Islamic State Twitter account”.\nIt was reported to have threatened attacks on planes flying from Heathrow to the US across the US Independence Day holiday weekend. The alert also warned “there will be a device placed in either Heathrow, LAX [Los Angeles] or JFK [New York] airports”.\nSpeaking about the latest concerns over access, the Department for Transport said: “We are aware of this issue. Safety and security of passengers is our priority.”\n“We keep aviation security under constant review, but as this matter is the subject of an ongoing police investigation we are unable to comment further at this time.”\n",

        "title": "Fifa corruption trial hears allegations officials took millions in bribes",
        "date": "2017-11-13T21:01:49Z",
        "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/nov/13/fifa-corruption-trial-new-york-marin-napot-murga",
        "text": "\nInside a packed New York City courtroom, and under heightened security on Monday, US prosecutors accused three former South American football administrators of taking millions of dollars in bribes as part of a web of endemic corruption at the heart of the sport’s governing body, Fifa. \nJosé Maria Marin, the 85-year-old former head of Brazil’s football federation, Juan Ángel Napout, the 59-year-old Paraguayan who was president of South American football’s governing body Conmebol, and Manuel Burga the 60-year-old former president of the Peruvian football federation, have denied multiple counts of racketeering, wire fraud and money laundering. \nTheir trial is the first in a sprawling federal corruption investigation of Fifa that was announced in May 2015 after several officials were arrested during a morning raid on a hotel in Zurich. Since then more than 40 officials and marketing executives have been charged by US authorities with 23 already pleading guilty. \nAs the defendants looked on, Marin staring ahead, Burga with his head in his hand and Napout appearing to take frantic notes, assistant US attorney Keith Edelman pointed to each of the men and told the jury: “These defendants cheated the sport in order to benefit themselves.” He added that they “did it year after year, tournament after tournament, bribe after bribe”. \nThe trial will focus on how marketing and sponsorship rights were sold for two major South American tournaments, the Copa América and the Copa Libertadores, as well as the Brazilian domestic tournament Copa do Brasil. The officials are accused of regularly taking six-figure bribes. \nDuring his opening remarks, Edelman singled out an event in May 2014 in Miami, Florida, where Fifa officials had gathered to announce a special centennial expansion of the Copa América, which would be held in the United States for the first time.\n\n\n\n\nHow the FBI won ‘the World Cup of fraud’ as Fifa scandal arrives in court\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“By all appearances it’s a proud moment in the history of the game,” Edleman told the jury. “There are drinks, press conferences but underneath the surface are lies, greed, corruption. Some of these officials had other reasons to celebrate, they had agreed to receive millions of dollars in bribes regarding the tournament.”\nEdelman said the US government would present evidence, derived from witness testimony, bank records, covert recordings and other documentation that proved each of the officials had received bribes. Marin, Edelman said, had received “millions into a US bank account”. Napout, the prosecutor alleged, had received his money in cash, sometimes “over $100,000 at a time”, whereas Marin, who had been the subject of a domestic corruption investigation, had told a middleman to “hold on to the money until the coast was clear”. \nIn each of their openings defense attorneys did not deny there had been corruption at Fifa, but said their clients were not part of it. They accused the US government of relying on the testimony of Fifa officials who had already pleaded guilty and cooperated with authorities in order to reduce their own sentences. \nArgentinian-Italian marketing executive Alejandro Burzaco is expected to be a key government witness, and according to Napout’s attorney, Silvia Pinera, got a “sweetheart deal” after he “turned himself in and began telling stories”. She accused the US government of paying other guilty officials hundreds of thousands of dollars to remain in the country to testify and providing their families with visas to the United States. \n“They’ve been here for years on our dimes,” Pinera told the jury. “We’re the taxpayer.”\nBruce Udolf, an attorney for Burga, argued that the government had “simply gone too far” and “simply got it wrong” by charging his client, labelling the allegations “despicable”. \n“They’ve made a lot of righteous charges against a lot of bad people. But Manuel Burga is not one of them,” Udolf said. \nCharles Stillman, Marin’s attorney, likened the conspiracy to a match of football among children, arguing his client had remained out of the game while other more senior officials dictated the play. “Marin was not one of them,” he told the jury. “He’s kind of like the youngster standing off to the side, picking up daisies.” \nBoth prosecutors and defense attorneys were at pains to explain to the court the significance of Fifa and football itself by comparing them to US sports. \n“It [Fifa] is kind of like the NFL or Major League Baseball but it’s for soccer all around the world,” Edelman told the jury. He added: “Here and around the world soccer is more than just a sport. It’s a passion, a way of life.” \nThe trial is expected to last up to six weeks. All three defendants face extensive prison time if found guilty. \n",

        "text": "\nA high court judge has ruled that Owen Oyston and his son Karl, the owners of Blackpool football club, must pay £31m to the minority shareholder Valeri Belokon for his shares after operating an “illegitimate stripping” of the club following promotion to the Premier League in 2010.\n\n\n\n\nSupporters Direct lobbies for tougher ‘fit and proper people test’ for owners\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJustice Marcus Smith found that the Oystons paid £26.77m out of the club to companies they owned, during and after the single lucrative season in the Premier League, in a manner which involved “fundamental breaches” of their duties as directors and unfairly prejudiced Belokon. The Oystons were ordered to pay £10m within 28 days and for all their assets to be frozen while they present to the court how they propose to pay the total, plus millions for legal costs.\nMore than 50 Blackpool supporters who had travelled to the Rolls building in London to attend the hearing applauded and congratulated Belokon after the judgment was delivered. Supporters have been bitterly protesting against the Oystons’ running of the club in recent years and thousands have heeded the Blackpool Supporters’ Trust’s call to boycott matches. Christine Seddon, chair of the trust, described the judgment as “a momentous day” for the club and football itself. The trust believes the financial pressure on the Oystons to meet the payment to Belokon makes it more likely they will have to sell the club.\nThe cash which Smith found had been illegitimately paid out of the club included £11m to a company owned by Owen Oyston, described in Blackpool’s 2010-11 accounts as a director’s salary.\nSmith ruled that the £11m was not truly a salary, describing it as an “essentially gratuitous” payment to Owen Oyston, the club’s long-term owner. Smith also ruled that two professionals employed by the Oystons made “misrepresentations” to Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs, which had mounted an investigation into the payment.\nThe court had heard that when Belokon’s adviser, Normunds Malnacs, first saw in February 2012 that the £11m was going to be paid to Owen Oyston’s company as a salary, he had sent an email protesting: “This is out of any acceptable corporate governance norms, even without mentioning the moral aspect of the transaction!”\nBelokon, a Latvian banker who invested £4.5m for a 20% stake in Blackpool in 2006, told the Guardian he had hoped to come to an agreement with the Oystons before deciding he had no option but to bring the legal action for unfair prejudice in September 2015. Represented by the City law firm Clifford Chance, Belokon argued in his claim that he had been frozen out of crucial decisions and he challenged the legitimacy of the millions the Oystons paid out to their own companies.\nBelokon’s barrister, Andrew Green QC, accused the Oystons of having run Blackpool as the family’s “personal cash machine”, following the club’s single season in the Premier League in 2010-11.\nThe Oystons strenuously contested the claim, arguing they had operated within their rights and in the best interests of the club.\nThe £31.27m award, forcing the Oystons to buy Belokon’s shares, was calculated by ruling that Belokon should have also been paid the £26.77m the Oystons saw fit to pay their own companies, and adding the £4.5m Belokon paid for his stake.\nBlackpool’s promotion to the Premier League was hailed as a romantic return of a formerly grand football name to the top flight, and Karl Oyston’s frugal methods, keeping players’ wages low and refusing to pay agents, were briefly admired as a model. But relations with fans soured following relegation, the plummet into League Two and the millions going out of the club.\nSupporters have boycotted matches in large numbers, including the play-off final last season when the club was promoted back to League One with banks of empty seats at Wembley. Fans have repeatedly called for the Oystons to sell but the family has been defiant and been prepared to sue some supporters for libel over comments made. In June 2015 Karl Oyston was fined £40,000 by the Football Association and banned from all football activities for six weeks for abusive text messages sent to a supporter as relations became increasingly bitter.\nBelokon himself was disqualified by the Football League from being a Blackpool director in May after a conviction in Kyrgyzstan for alleged money laundering. His disqualification came under the EFL’s rule that directors must not have unspent criminal convictions involving dishonesty. Belokon argues the conviction is invalid because it was decided in his absence without due process, following a dispute with the Kyrgyzstan authorities over his bank.\nIn his judgment Smith agreed, stating that he found it “extraordinary” the EFL should disqualify Belokon for a conviction based on him having not attended the court in Kyrgyzstan, rather than “on the merits”.\nIn court after the judgment Belokon said he believed the way the Oystons ran the club was “wrong and unfair”. Asked what he hoped might happen to Blackpool, following a judgment which Smith himself said would “result in the [club’s] further impoverishment”, Belokon said he was still prepared to discuss a possible solution with the Oystons.\nKarl Oyston was approached for comment but at the time of writing had not responded.\n",

        "text": "\nWestpac is ending all association with the government of Nauru and its entities, and has informed those affected to close their accounts by the end of the month.\nThe ABC’s Pacific Beat program reported on Thursday that the bank had acted after concerns were raised by internal anti-money-laundering and counter-terrorism financing experts.\nA spokeswoman for Westpac was unable to confirm or deny the report due to customer confidentiality. \nGuardian Australia has independently confirmed the story.\n\n\n\n\nNauru election: former presidents say moves to 'rig' result under way\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGuardian Australia understands the decision relates to the Nauruan government and its specific entities, and will not affect regular customers who make banking transactions to Nauru. The bank has no physical presence on the island nation.\nThe bank has scaled back its operations in the Pacific region over recent years, but the decision to break ties with the Nauruan government appears to have taken the country by surprise.\nA former president, Marcus Stephen, told Pacific Beat he had asked the government to explain the situation to its citizens.\nThe Nauruan government has been contacted for comment.\nSprent Dabwido, former president of Nauru, said the news was not unexpected.\n“It’s ... not a total surprise when you have a government that is reckless in handling the finances of a nation,” he told Guardian Australia.\n“I can’t blame them because most of the dealings of this government are never straightforward, never black and white,” he said.\nDabwido said the news was hard to reconcile with recent legal changes.\n“It is not only embarrassing, it is a big shame that this news pops up now. How do we explain it to our people, when we have the anti-money-laundering act, we’ve closed our offshore banking, and then suddenly this shows up again,” he said.\n“I really feel the government has a lot of explaining to do to the people.”\nIn 2014 the Nauru government’s Westpac accounts were temporarily frozen while a US hedge fund, Firebrand, chased it for about $31m related to bonds it had defaulted on. The high court later dismissed the company’s case and found Nauru’s accounts could not be garnisheed.\nMore recently the government has faced allegations of attempting to rig the coming election, with public concerns raised by two former presidents.\nSince the end of the Firebrand court case, the Nauruan government has repeatedly trumpeted an improving economic outlook for the country.\nThis week it announced the establishment of a “sustainable sovereign trust fund”, to be chaired by the minister for finance and justice, David Adeang, and funded by a one-off grant from the Asian Development Bank, annual contributions from the Australian and Taiwanese governments, and “ongoing establishment support from valued partners”.\nThe Nauruan government said it expects the fund to reach $32m by the end of this financial year.\nOn Wednesday the country became the 189th member of the International Monetary Fund. Adeang was in Washington to formally sign on for his country.\n“This shows just how far my administration has come in showing the world we are a fiscally mature and responsible economy, free of the burden of past governments,” the president, Baron Waqa, said.\n\n\n\nChristine Lagarde \n(@Lagarde)\nI’m very pleased to welcome Nauru as the 189th member of the IMF, look forward to working with the people of Nauru pic.twitter.com/KkBj8sjKuc\n\nApril 12, 2016\n\n\n",

        "text": "\nVladimir Putin has accused US lawmakers of “insolence”, and promised Russia will retaliate if the latest round of US sanctions against Russia are signed into law.\nThe House of Representatives voted by 419 votes to three on Tuesday to pass the new sanctions bill, which targets Russia as well as North Korea and Iran.\n\n\n\n\nTrump's Russia problem: who's in the deepest?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe US legislation was passed overwhelmingly by the Senate on Thursday, and will now go to Donald Trump for his signature. Trump, who enjoyed two warm conversations with Putin at the G20 summit earlier this month, is likely to face a major backlash if he attempts to veto the legislation, with his administration already embroiled in a Russia scandal.\n“We are behaving in a very restrained and patient way, but at some moment we will need to respond,” said Putin at a press conference with his Finnish counterpart, Sauli Niinistö. \n“It’s impossible to endlessly tolerate this kind of insolence towards our country,” Putin said, referring to the sanctions. “This practice is unacceptable – it destroys international relations and international law.”\nPutin was vague on exactly how Russia might respond. The newspaper Kommersant quoted two unnamed sources saying a range of potential responses was under consideration in Moscow, including expelling US diplomats, seizing diplomatic properties, increasing restrictions on US companies working in Russia and halting enriched uranium shipments to US power plants.\nBefore leaving office, Barack Obama ordered the expulsion of 35 Russian diplomats and the seizure of two Russian diplomatic compounds, in retaliation for Russian meddling in the US election. Russia made the unusual move of not responding reciprocally, allegedly after being given assurances that the incoming Trump administration would reverse the move. \nHowever, that has not happened, and the foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova complained recently that US authorities were not granting visas to Russian diplomats the foreign ministry wants to send to replace those expelled. She said reciprocal measures would be forthcoming if this policy did not change.\nPutin and other Russian officials have repeatedly denied any meddling in the US election, while US intelligence agencies say they have overwhelming evidence of a coordinated Russian campaign. Putin on Thursday described the allegations as “hysteria”, and said: “It’s a great pity that Russian-US relations are being sacrificed to resolve questions of domestic politics.”\nAlthough Trump has repeatedly spoken of a desire for improved relations with Russia, the electoral interference allegations have prompted Democrats and Republicans to unite in support of tougher sanctions. It seems inevitable that further US sanctions will be met with a firm Russian response. \n“Hope dies last but it is dying,” wrote Konstantin Kosachev, the chairman of the foreign relations committee of Russia’s upper house of parliament, after the US vote on Tuesday. “The further degradation of bilateral cooperation is inevitable, even though it seems like it couldn’t get any worse.”\n",

        "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/nov/01/electoral-commission-to-investigate-arron-banks-brexit-donations-eu-referendum",
        "text": "\nThe election watchdog has launched an investigation into whether donations and loans from the Brexit campaigner Arron Banks and one of his companies broke campaign finance rules in the run-up to the EU referendum.\nThe Electoral Commission will investigate donations worth £2.3m, assessing whether Banks was the “true source” of loans made in his name. It will also establish whether Better for the Country was the “true source” of donations made to Brexit campaigners or whether it was “acting as an agent” for some other source of funds. Banks is a director of Better for the Country and the majority shareholder.\nThe money given by Banks to Leave.EU in the run-up to the referendum was believed to be the biggest donation in British political history. Banks has previously claimed he is worth £100m. An estimate by the Sunday Times puts his fortune at £250m. However, an analysis by Open Democracy suggests the actual figure may be considerably lower.\nAccording to a statement from the Commission, the investigation will also investigate whether “any individual facilitated a transaction” with a “non-qualifying person”. Donors from outside the UK and Gibraltar were impermissible donors for referendum campaigning.\nThe investigation will also assess whether the recipients of the donations took appropriate steps to identify the source of funds. \nQuestions have been raised about overseas influence in both the referendum campaign and the US election won by Donald Trump. This week, the former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort has surrendered to federal authorities after charges were filed against him over money laundering and conspiracy against the United States. Manafort’s links with Russia have come under close scrutiny. \nBanks has boasted about meeting the Russian ambassador, but insisted no political funding came from Russian sources. \nLast month, a Labour MP called for an inquiry into Banks and the use of “dark money” in the referendum campaign. Ben Bradshaw urged parliament and the Electoral Commission to examine claims of illegal donations “very carefully”.\nSpeaking in parliament, Labour MP Ben Bradshaw said there was “widespread concern over foreign and particularly Russian interference in western democracies”.\nAfter the news broke on Wednesday Banks tweeted in response:\n\n\nArron Banks \n(@Arron_banks)\nGosh I'm terrified https://t.co/t46IBFhfpV\n\nNovember 1, 2017\n\n\nLater he issued a statement acknowledging a long lunch with the Russian ambassador to the UK but insisting that “The Guardian allegations of Brexit being funded by the Russians and propagated by Ben Bradshaw” were “complete bollocks”.\nHe added: “My sole involvement with the ‘Russians’ was a boozy six-hour lunch with the ambassador where we drank the place dry (they have some cracking vodka and brandy). \n“Turning to the investigation, we believe that a judge-led inquiry reporting to Parliament that investigates the main campaign groups, Vote Leave, Remain, and Leave.EU would be the best way to clear this nonsense up once and for all.\n“The Remain ‘Electoral Commission’ isn’t up to the job and consists of political place men from all main parties.”\nBob Posner, the director of political finance and regulation and legal counsel at the Electoral Commission, said there were “questions over the legitimacy” of the donations.\nPosner said: “Interest in the funding of the EU referendum campaigns remains widespread. Questions over the legitimacy of funding provided to campaigners at the referendum risks causing harm to voters’ confidence. It is therefore in the public interest that the Electoral Commission seeks to ascertain whether or not impermissible donations were given to referendum campaigners and if any other related offences have taken place.”\nBanks was registered as a “permitted participant” in the EU referendum, which meant he spent more than £10,000 during the campaign. Better for the Country was not registered as a permitted participant. Its reported donations, made between March and June 2016, were given to Brexit campaigner groups including Grassroots Out Ltd, Trade Unionists Against the EU and UKIP.\nThe rules around donations to permitted participants at the EU referendum are set out in the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000. The Electoral Commission has the power to fine Banks up to £20,000, and in serious breaches can refer the case to the police.\nOn indictment, the penalty under PPERA for one charge of “facilitating the making of donations by impermissible donors” is up to a year in jail. A charge of “failure to provide information about donors” also carried the possibility of up to a year in jail.\nThe Electoral Commission is already investigating whether one or more donations – including of services – accepted by Leave.EU was impermissible, and whether Leave.EU’s spending return was complete. The Commission’s statement warned that other offences might emerge during the course of the inquiry. \n",

        "text": "\nDonald Trump’s lawyer emailed Vladimir Putin’s spokesman during the US presidential campaign asking for help with a Trump real estate project in Moscow, according to email evidence presented to Congress.\nMichael Cohen, who was vice-president of the Trump Organization at the time as well as being Trump’s attorney, sent an email to Dmitry Peskov, a top Kremlin official, according to the Washington Post.\n\n\n\n\nAll the president's men's lawyers: who are Trumpworld's leading attorneys?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Over the past few months I have been working with a company based in Russia regarding the development of a Trump Tower-Moscow project in Moscow City,” the Post reported, citing “a person familiar with the email”.\n“Without getting into lengthy specifics the communication between our two sides has stalled,” Cohen said in the Peskov email, which is the most direct high-level communication between the Trump camp and the Kremlin to have emerged so far in the sprawling investigation into Trump-Moscow links.\nIn a dossier of allegations of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials compiled by former British intelligence official, Christopher Steele, Peskov is cited as being in charge of a Kremlin operation to damage Hillary Clinton’s candidacy and promote Trump’s. \nThe Steele dossier also portrays Cohen as being a key player in the alleged collusion to skew the election, a role Cohen has repeatedly denied. \nAccording to the Post, Cohen wrote to Peskov: “As this project is too important, I am hereby requesting your assistance,” adding: “I respectfully request someone, preferably you, contact me so that I might discuss the specifics as well as arranging meetings with the appropriate individuals. I thank you in advance for your assistance and look forward to hearing from you soon.”\nThe email is a vivid illustration of the blurred lines between Trump’s business and political activities. When it was sent, Trump was in full campaign mode, holding daily rallies in Iowa, New Hampshire and other states critical to the Republican primary contest.\nOther emails published on Monday showed that the Trump Tower project was being promoted by a Russian-born business associate of Trump who was claiming he could persuade Vladimir Putin to back the real estate scheme and help get Trump elected president. \nThe new details about Trump’s links with the Kremlin, now being investigated by a special prosecutor, emerged from the leaks of emails sent by Felix Sater, who worked for the Trump Organization pursuing property deals around the world. \nSater’s emails, sent in late 2015 to Trump’s lawyer and then Trump Organization vice-president, Michael Cohen, gave an upbeat assessment of the chances of getting Putin to back the development of a Trump Tower in Moscow and the positive knock-on effect that would have on Trump’s presidential campaign.\n“Our boy can become president of the USA and we can engineer it,” Sater said, according to an email published by the New York Times. “I will get all of Putin’s team to buy in on this, I will manage this process.”\n In another email, Sater looked forward to the eventual ribbon-cutting on a Trump Tower in the Russian capital. “I will get Putin on this program and we will get Donald elected,” he wrote.\n It is unclear, from the email excerpts published, to what extent Sater expected Putin to intervene directly to help Trump’s election campaign, but he clearly presented the Russian leader as crucial in determining the outcome of the US vote. However, the Trump Tower in Moscow never materialized. Cohen said in a statement published by the New York Times, that he had suspected Sater of overstating the prospects of success.\n “He has sometimes used colorful language and has been prone to ‘salesmanship’,” Cohen said. “I ultimately determined that the proposal was not feasible and never agreed to make a trip to Russia.”\nAccording to a statement Cohen submitted to Congress, also obtained by the Washington Post, he said he had written to Peskov on Sater’s recommendation, in an effort to get Russian government approval of the Trump Tower project. He said he did not recall receiving a response from the Kremlin spokesman and the project was abandoned two weeks later.\nThe Trump Organization is reported to have handed the emails to congressional committee carrying out a parallel investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. It issued a statement Monday saying: “To be clear, the Trump Organization has never had any real estate holdings or interests in Russia.”\nHowever, the Cohen email to Peskov suggest that the organization was still eagerly pursuing a Trump Tower development in Moscow months after Trump entered the presidential race. \nAccording to Bloomberg News, Cohen said in his statement to Congress that he had discussed the Trump Tower-Moscow project with Trump himself on three occasions and that the Trump Organisation signed a non-binding letter of intent with a Russian developer in October 2015. However, Cohen said the building permits were not forthcoming from the Russian government, and that he had taken the decision to close down the project in early 2016 without referring to his boss, and for purely “business reasons”. \nSater has emerged as a central figure in the Trump-Moscow investigation. He was born Felix Sheferovsky in Moscow in 1966 and moved to the US with his family when still a child. He was imprisoned for stabbing a man in the face with the stem of a smashed margarita glass in 1991, and avoided jail for involvement in a mob-related money-laundering and stock-fraud scheme by becoming an informant for the FBI on organised crime and arms trafficking. \nThe assistant attorney-general who signed Sater’s plea deal in 1998, Andrew Weissman, is now working in the special prosecutor team investigating a Trump-Moscow links.\n\n\n\n\nLawyers who said Trump has no ties to Russia named Russian law firm of 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Financial Times reported that Sater is also cooperating with an international investigation into a Kazakh money-laundering network.\nSater and Cohen are reported to have known each other since they were teenagers in New York. Sater established a business relationship with Trump when he was working for a real estate company Bayrock, which partnered with the Trump Organization to build the Trump SoHo hotel in New York, which was completed in 2010. The same year Sater was distributing business card identifying him as a “senior adviser” to Trump. \nHowever, the Trump Organization denied it ever formally employed Sater. Questioned in late 2015, about the time Sater was sending emails about Moscow, Trump claimed not to remember him.\n“Felix Sater, boy, I have to even think about it,” he told the Associated Press. “I’m not that familiar with him.”\n",

        "text": "\nChina remained by far the biggest destination for Australian cash this year, while the amount of funds transferred to Estonia experienced a huge, unexplained spike. \nNew data published on Austrac’s freedom of information disclosure log reveals the annual totals of international funds transfers from Australian accounts since 2010. \nThe movement of funds itself is not suspicious, but can provide intelligence for anti-money laundering organisations like Austrac.\n\n\n\n\nCash in hand: how big is Australia’s black economy?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis year, $1.26bn was moved from Australian bank accounts to China, compared to $591m in 2010. \nThe Philippines received $652m, making it the next biggest destination for funds transfers, jumping from $347m six years ago. \nBritain, India, and the United States were also among the top destinations for Australian money last year, although the amount of funds being transferred to the US dropped significantly since 2010.\nThe amount of funds that moved to the small European nation of Estonia jumped dramatically. \nIn 2010, just $77,500 moved from Australian accounts to the small European nation. That had increased dramatically to $4.3m by 2015, and again to $8.9m in 2016.\nAnti-money laundering expert, John Walker, said most of the changes could be easily explained by trade.\nEstonia joined the European Union in 2004, and Walker said this may explain the spike in funds transfer since 2010.\nHe said it could simply be due to an increase in trade between Australia and Estonia, due to their EU membership, or because money launderers took advantage of a “new” opportunity in that country.\nThe Austrac data appeared to also show a huge increase in funds transfers to Monaco, from $3,347 in 2010 to $1.6m in 2016.\n\n\n\n\nA crackdown on the cash economy is an attack on the poor and a reward for banks | Philip Soos\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWalker said he doubted the increase suggested greater use of Monaco for money laundering.\n“The increases can reflect an increase in trade between Monaco and Australia – it’s virtually impossible to tell – remember that these are not necessarily ‘suspicious’ transactions,” Walker said.\n“Monaco has never figured very highly, and that’s because casinos are very good at laundering money without raising suspicions.”\nAnother expert, Todd Harland, who heads consultancy AML Solutions International, told News Corp that the spike in funds to Estonia warranted a close examination by authorities.\n• This article was amended on 29 December 2016 to correct the date that Estonia joined the EU.\n",

        "text": "\nWhen my girlfriend became pregnant I decided to sell my bitcoins to decorate a nursery. I auctioned them via localbitcoins. You put your coins into an escrow account, wait for an offer and, when the buyer has paid by Bacs, you release the coins. The buyers are verified by email, telephone and an official ID. \nAfter a couple of days I had an offer. The buyer transferred the funds into my HSBC bank account; I released the coins. The same buyer made another purchase of £530. \nAnother buyer then offered £6,700 for the rest of my coins. As I attempted to verify this transaction, there was an issue with my online bank account and I headed to an HSBC branch to get things sorted. The manager confirmed I’d received the £6,700 and I released the coins.\nAfter about an hour at the branch I was told that the earlier, smaller transaction had been marked as fraud and the money removed from my account, but there was no problem with the second larger amount. \nMy account was then blocked for several days. I was informed that the larger payment had also been marked fraudulent and all the payments had been taken from me. \nI spent around six hours being passed around by HSBC trying to get an answer. Eventually I was told that I had been the victim of fraud and that the money would be returned. After 10 days my account was unfrozen and I was promised an update. Instead, the account was once again blocked. I can’t get any straight answers. SLW, Bristol\nBitcoin is a virtual currency that has become a fount of free cash for fraudsters. It can be sold on online exchange sites for real money and transferred into the buyer’s virtual wallet, but these wallets are vulnerable to hackers and bitcoin transactions are not regulated so there’s no compensation.\nA number of sellers have lost their investments after falling victim to hackers, but in your case it seems the buyers were genuine.\nHSBC’s anti money-laundering security alerts were triggered by the unusual sums entering your account, and the bank says it ring-fenced the money and blocked your access while it investigated. Unfortunately you were given mixed messages, for which HSBC apologises. “The funds have been returned, and the account returned to the status it held previously,” it says. “We have also credited the account with £100 as a gesture of goodwill. We will be providing relevant feedback to staff who were involved as, on this occasion, we did not meet the high standards of customer service that we, and our customers, expect.”\nIf you need help email Anna Tims at your.problems@observer.co.uk or write to Your Problems, The Observer, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.
