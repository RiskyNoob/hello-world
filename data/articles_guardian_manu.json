        "text": "\nManchester United’s interest in Alexis Sánchez may be the lead story in most newspaper sports sections – even if, as the Express puts it, “the general belief, both at Old Trafford and the Emirates, remains that City are strong favourites to sign him” – but the Telegraph goes not one but two better, revealing that José Mourinho has also enquired about Leicester’s Jamie Vardy and West Ham’s former Old Trafford favourite Javier Hernández – and that he didn’t stop there, with “a range of strikers” under consideration. Vardy, they say, would cost at least £35m but would need the express permission of the Leicester chairman, Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, before he departs, while the Hammers would seek to recoup the £17m they lavished on Hernández in the summer, nearly £10m more than United sold him for less than three years ago. David Moyes, however, seems determined to get rid of the Mexican – Los Angeles FC are also keen – and is lining up Krasnodar’s Fyodor Smolov as a replacement.\n\n\n\n\nManchester United offer £25m for Alexis Sánchez in attempt to hijack City deal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHaving attempted to hijack Sánchez’s move to Manchester City, United have got the taste for snaffling their rivals’ targets and the Independent reports that they will “strongly challenge Liverpool if the Anfield club go in for Borussia Dortmund’s Christian Pulisic in the summer”, hoping to get their mitts not just on his youthful footballing stylings but also “all the commercial value” that would follow from the American becoming his homeland’s first genuine footballing superstar.\nTalking of Liverpool, having started only five Premier League games this season and none in Europe, Daniel Sturridge is fretting about his place in the England World Cup squad and has come to the conclusion that his only choice is to leave Liverpool before the month is out. His employers are determined to extract maximum value from the 28-year-old, and will only let him go if someone coughs up £30m. A loan is not being considered although, according to the Liverpool Echo, “that position could change later in the window if the asking price isn’t met and there’s a hefty loan fee on the table”. He could end up replacing Hernández at West Ham, or travelling the well-trodden path between Anfield and Southampton’s St Mary’s Stadium, only in an unusual direction.\nChelsea are in the market for a manager, says the Mail, with Antonio Conte “preparing to move on” come the summer – they make Max Allegri and Luis Enrique the favourites to replace the Italian in the Stamford Bridge hotseat, though other names are being considered. The Mirror, meanwhile, is already looking a step further, speculating that Conte will in due course duke it out for the Paris St-Germain job with his great friend and serial striker-considerer José Mourinho.\nThomas Lemar latest: the Arsenal and Liverpool target may leave Monaco this month, but then he might not. Don’t ask Leonardo Jardim, though, with the Frenchman’s manager admitting that “the numbers today are incredibly big”, so big that despite his preference for keeping hold of the forward “everything can change” and “the things I can say today are not true tomorrow”. Riyad Mahrez, meanwhile, is being linked with the same two clubs but finds himelf in a particularly confusing place: Liverpool would prefer not to buy him but might; he would prefer not to join them but could; he wants to sign for Arsenal but probably won’t; Arsenal’s intentions are uncertain.\n"

Manchester City are deep in negotiations with the north London club over the transfer of Alexis Sánchez to the Etihad. Despite being unwilling to match Arsenal’s £35m asking price, they remain hopeful of getting a deal over the line sooner rather than later. City sporting director Txiki Bergiristain is reported to have spent Friday and Saturday discussing numbers with the Arsenal bean-counters and is confident of securing Sánchez’s services for £25m. In the aftermath of the embarrassment at the City Ground, Wenger took time out from berating his underperforming players to deny speculation that he is on the verge of signing West Brom defender Jonny Evans, who is also a City target.\nHaving bid adieu to Philippe Coutinho, Liverpool will ramp up their well-documented interest in Monaco’s Thomas Lemar and also plan to offer RB Leipzig a little extra on top of the agreed fee for Naby Keita to bring the midfielder’s move to Anfield forward from the summer to right now. With a hectic festive period behind them, Liverpool’s players have been sent to Dubai for a few days of rest and relaxation, but their recruitment department will enjoy no such luxury.

Sevilla midfielder Steven Nzonzi also remains a target, while Championship basement-dwellers Sunderland will happily show central defender Lamine Koné the door if Everton renew their interest in the Ivory Coast international who is currently sidelined with a knee injury.\nLeicester City are in talks with French Ligue 2 side Gazélec Ajaccio with a view to signing 22-year-old winger Fousseni Diabaté, according to local paper the Mercury. Claude Puel’s side are believed to have agreed a fee of £1.8m for the Mali U-23 international. In unexpected news, Leicester central defender Harry Maguire has been linked with a potential £50m move to Manchester City just six months after rocking up to the King Power Stadium. With Wes Morgan injured and Robert Huth just back from a spell on the sidelines, Leicester are unlikely to entertain any offers for the England international.\nNewcastle manager Rafa Benítez hopes to bring Real Madrid right-back Achraf Hakimi to St James’ Park on loan, while Chelsea cultural attache and midfielder Kenedy remains on his radar. The Magpies are also in the market for a goalkeeper, but the Evening Chronicle reports that moves for West Ham’s Joe Hart and PSG’s Kevin Trapp are unlikely to be successful. Despite saying he wants to fight for his place at Liverpool, Danny Ings could be shipped out to Newcastle, although West Bromwich Albion are also hopeful of drafting in the 25-year-old to help in what currently passes for their fight against relegation. \nParis Saint-Germain outcast Lucas Moura is hopeful of getting a move to Manchester United, according to French TV station Telefoot. Nantes, Nice, Bordeaux and Real Betis are also interested in the Brazilian winger who has his heart set on a move to United.\nAnd finally, after successfully breaking out of Sunderland, for whom he scored 12 times in 19 appearances while on loan from Bournemouth, Lewis Grabban will get to sample life at the opposite end of the Championship table in a successful, winning team when he signs for runaway leaders Wolves. \n"

        "text": "\nJosé Mourinho believed the failure of Craig Pawson, the referee, to award a penalty for a Maya Yoshida handball on 32 minutes was crucial as Manchester United were again unable to claim victory. The contest ended in a third consecutive draw for Mourinho’s side, meaning they have dropped six points out of the last nine.\n\n\n\n\nManchester United 0-0 Southampton: Premier League – as it happened\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYet the manager also pointed to further penalty claims in the 2-2 results with Leicester City and Burnley as reasons why they did not win those matches. The bottom line is, though, that United have slumped to third position and will be 17 points behind Manchester City should their rivals defeat Crystal Palace on Sunday.\nThe Portuguese’s problems are further deepened by the prospect of losing his top scorer, Romelu Lukaku, for two matches because of a ninth-minute clash of heads with Wesley Hoedt. If the striker is concussed, Premier League return-to-play guidelines stipulate he cannot return until a minimum of six days have elapsed.\nOf the penalty claim, Mourinho said: “I watched on the touchline and it looked for me very clear but there was 50m distance so I [at first] give the referee the benefit of the doubt. I know my players so when I see people like [Juan] Mata almost in hysterics I know, no doubt, and then at half-time I watch it.\n“It is a penalty like [Marcus] Rashford against Leicester, [Ander] Herrera against City. [Jonathan] Moss, [Michael] Oliver and Craig tonight are good referees. So the referees’ performances in these matches were good – these were unlucky decisions that punished us.”\nUnited are at Everton on New Year’s Day and then host Derby County on Friday in the FA Cup. The manager fears he will have to prepare for both games without Lukaku.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Romelu Lukaku is stretchered off in the first half after a clash of heads with Wesley Hoedt. Photograph: Super/SilverHub/Rex/Shutterstock\n\n\n“I don’t know [how serious it is],” he said. “I know that normally bad news arrives immediately and bad news didn’t arrive but to leave the pitch the way he did, we don’t think twice to make that decision immediately, because there is a problem not just for today but the next two matches I would say for sure.”\nThere was further bad news for Mourinho with Zlatan Ibrahimovic ruled out for a month after suffering a setback in his recovery from a serious knee injury. “Zlatan is out for a month. It’s the same knee,” he said.\n“It’s an incredible problem, a 37-year-old man, a lion like he says, a real lion, but it’s not easy. Now he had a little recurrence and one month out.”\nAshley Young could also face a retrospective ban after seemingly elbowing Dusan Tadic just after the hour. As Pawson did not see the incident the Football Association could rule on it as early as New Year’s Eve – in time for Young to miss the Everton trip if he is found guilty.\n\n\n\n\nMohamed Salah double inspires Liverpool fightback after Vardy opener\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSouthampton’s manager, Mauricio Pellegrino, said he did not see the incident. “I haven’t seen the replay but it is difficult for the referee to see in one second what happened in all different places … I have to respect the decision.” United’s onfield issue is that their early-season spark has gone and they now seem worryingly sedated. Here again they could not break Saints down – Mourinho’s side won countless corners and hogged possession but lacked creativity in the final third.\nYet the manager said: “I think we played [well] enough to win with all the difficulties. We started the game and we lose the striker [Lukaku]. We lose one of the only two changes I have on the bench to change in attacking areas, leaving just one for the rest of the 90 minutes – I have to bring on Rashford to play all 90 minutes when he clearly needs a bit of rest.\n“Then a very good referee, one of the most promising young referees in Europe, had a very bad decision that punished us and then the game was about us trying and missing some important chances and always trying to create and play. And them trying to create a chance in isolated counterattacks. They had one very good chance that David [de Gea] saved and we kept trying with what we have.”\nThat opportunity came just before Lukaku’s injury. Sofiane Boufal made the right byline and pulled the ball back. A Luke Shaw mistake teed it up for James Ward-Prowse and, after De Gea made a fine stop, the lingering Boufal was adjudged offside.\nUnited could have done without a likely goal of their own being chalked off because of a needless offside but the otherwise anonymous Paul Pogba added just that as the contest neared its end. Nemanja Matic’s shot appeared to have beaten Alex McCarthy, who was making his Premier League debut for Saints after Fraser Forster was dropped. Pogba stretched and helped it home, however, and the goal was chalked off.\nAsked if McCarthy is now his No1, Pellegrino said: “In football nothing is fixed. Everything is changing all the time. The reality today will change tomorrow. I try to use the moment of the player and the player I think is better I try to give the opportunity. After they have to show on the pitch.”\nThis is what United have to start doing – upping their performance on each and every game day.\n"

        "text": "\nManchester United are preparing an opening offer of initial £25m for Fulham teenager Ryan Sessegnon, with José Mourinho prepared to allow Luke Shaw to leave Old Trafford in order to sign the England youth international.\nSessegnon, 17, who finished as joint-top scorer at the European Under-19 Championship in June with three goals, has been tracked by United’s scouts for some time and has also attracted interest from Tottenham and Real Madrid. The European champions have watched the defender on several occasions this season and are understood to be monitoring his situation, while Spurs had a bid potentially worth more than £20m with add-ons rejected in the summer.\nDespite usually operating as a left-back, Sessegnon is also capable of operating further up the field and has gained a reputation as one of English football’s brightest attacking talents. He became the became the first 17-year-old to score a hat-trick in the top four divisions of English football since Dele Alli when he inspired Fulham’s 5-4 victory over Sheffield United in November.\n\n\n\n\nEngland's under-17s: 'They don’t walk around with 1966 noose around necks'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFulham have indicated that it would take a bid in excess of £30m to tempt them into selling their prized asset, with manager Slavisa Jokanovic admitting on Thursday that he is unsure whether Sessegnon will remain at Craven Cottage.\n“In this moment, I am not thinking of being without him for the season, but it is not under my control,” he said.\n“All the questions are what the value of this player is, but myself, as a coach, I prefer to stay with the more important players for the competition that is ahead of us, but on the other side I can understand the business side too. If we want to be competitive we must keep our important players.”\nShould United have a bid accepted, Tottenham are expected to renew their approach but have also enquired about Shaw, who has fallen out of favour at Old Trafford under Mourinho. The 22-year-old has played just 328 minutes in the Premier League so far this season having joined United from Southampton in 2014 for £30m, although any move for Sessegnon is not believed to be contingent on him leaving.\nTottenham are also interested in signing Sessegnon’s twin brother, Steven, who also plays for Fulham and starred for England’s Under-17s in their World Cup victory earlier this year. Along with Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester City, Mauricio Pochettino also retains an interest in Crystal Palace’s Wilfried Zaha but Crystal Palace are adamant that the £50m-rated forward will not be sold in January.\n"

Donald Trump’s hopes of becoming the next president of the United States are rated as likely as Leicester winning the Premier League title. And José Mourinho is the undisputed king of English football. Oh, what memories.\nBut then it all went wrong, didn’t it? Cameron retired to his shed, Trump took over the world and Mourinho lost his rag with the club doctor, moved to a hotel in Manchester and now spends his time in the shadow of some bald bloke from Barcelona. There’s no need to panic, though, because good old José has a cunning plan. \n\n\n\n\nThe 100 best footballers in the world 2017 – 100-41\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Remember that lad Eden you had at Chelsea?” someone may have said to him as he sat through Manchester City’s latest evisceration of one of their title “rivals” on Saturday. “He was quite good.” And that was that. According to the Sun, Mourinho is now planning a new British record £90m move for Chelsea star Eden Hazard because he sees him as “the missing piece in his Old Trafford jigsaw” and believes he can beat Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain to the brilliant Belgian playmaker. Boom!\nThere may be one snag, however, as the article notes with caution in the 13th paragraph. “And, while he is understood to be one of the players Mourinho had a strained relationship with when he was axed months after lifting that title, the Special One is ready to raid his old club.” That’s right – if you remember, this is the guy who went from being the best in the league to being an unused substitute in Mourinho’s last game in charge of Chelsea. \nYet, as The Mill has said before many times, stranger things have happened. Hazard, it seems, has already rejected Chelsea’s offer of a new contract worth £300,000 a week and is interested in leaving Stamford Bridge. All José needs to do now is say sorry and they can all be friends, just like he did with Romelu Lukaku. What could go wrong? \nJust in case it does, the Mirror reports Atlético Madrid are dangling a carrot that looks like Antoine Griezmann in Manchester United’s direction in the hope of keeping him out of the clutches of naughty Barcelona, who they have reported to Fifa for an illegal approach to the Frenchman’s entourage. Liverpool fans may be wondering why their club didn’t take the same approach during the Philippe Coutinho saga in the summer, even if the Brazilian could now be destined to stay at Anfield for the foreseeable should Griezmann end up joining Barça. \n\n\n\n\nAtlético Madrid report Barcelona to Fifa over Antoine Griezmann approach\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTalking of Liverpool, Jürgen Klopp is prepared to allow teenage sensation Ben Woodburn to go out on loan next month, with his most likely destination being the Championship. Good luck to him. It also looks like being a busy month across Stanley Park as Sam Allardyce gets himself warm in the Everton hotseat with Theo Walcott and Steven N’Zonzi on his Christmas list. N’Zonzi, of course, used to play for Stoke and they could do with some decent players. But we’re told Mark Hughes will have some cash to burn in the January sales and retains the full support of his board. Stephen Ireland is already on board having been offered a new contract despite not having played in the Premier League since May 2016. Who’s next\nHaving scored only 14 goals so far, Brighton are weighing up a new bid for Cape Verde striker Zé Luís from Spartak Moscow and also have their eye on Celtic’s Moussa Dembélé. And not content with his firepower as Aston Villa attempt to return to the big time, Steve Bruce wants Premier League outcasts Nahki Wells of Burnley or Leicester’s Leonardo Ulloa. \n"

        "text": "\nJosé Mourinho is becoming ever more desperate to explain Manchester United’s slump. Saturday’s torpid stalemate with Southampton at Old Trafford was the third consecutive game his side took only a point, following the 2-2 draws against Leicester City and Burnley.\nAs Manchester City end the year with a 15-point advantage over United, Mourinho’s side are third and appear devoid of spark and creativity. Asked why, the Portuguese, who once bent title races to his will, cited ill fortune, bad refereeing decisions and injury.\n\n\n\n\nMourinho hits out at referee after Southampton hold Manchester United\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“I feel unlucky, yes. But unlucky in football? You have to change, which is what we try to do. When I speak about three penalties in matches where a penalty and a possible goal makes a huge difference, I want to say unlucky because it is what I feel. I could be here with a biased theory, which I am not going [to do] at all.\n“I am happy with the refereeing performances in these matches and [they were] just unlucky decisions. You have to be biased against us to say that the penalty against [Manchester] City and Leicester and Southampton were not penalties.”\nSaturday’s non-penalty involved the ball hitting Maya Yoshida’s arm as Jesse Lingard looked to penetrate Southampton’s defence. The one at Leicester involved Marcus Rashford and against City it was Ander Herrera. An image of Mourinho clutching a handful of straws comes to mind.\nSo, too, when Mourinho points to absent players. Romelu Lukaku was carried off on a stretcher after a ninth-minute clash of heads with Wesley Hoedt on Saturday. Mourinho believes his top scorer may miss the New Year Day’s trip to Everton and Friday’s visit of Derby County in the FA Cup. Zlatan Ibrahimovic is out for four weeks after a setback in his recovery from a serious knee injury. Mourinho has also lost his full-back Ashley Young for three games after the 32-year-old accepted a charge of violent conduct from the Football Association after appearing to strike Dusan Tadic with his elbow on Saturday. The incident was not spotted by the referee, Craig Pawson, and Young did not contest the charge.\n“The boys are trying,” the manager said. “We have lots of problems. We lost Lukaku, we lost Ibrahimovic for a month. To lose him for a month means he stops his run to the recovery. He has been running for many months. In the period where what he needs is to play and have minutes, we lose him for a month.\n“We lose Lukaku, I don’t know for how long. I don’t remember the last time [Marouane] Fellaini played. It was long time ago. I don’t remember. A match at home against Brighton [25 November]. It was a long time ago. Michael Carrick was in pre-season. I don’t remember him playing during the season [he played in a Carabao Cup game in September], so we have problems.”\nEverton may have lost for the first time under Sam Allardyce on Saturday – 2-1 at Bournemouth – yet a visit to Goodison Park is hardly where Mourinho would choose to arrest United’s slump. Still, he is reaching for positives. “Three draws are different than three defeats,” Mourinho said. “The difference is just three points but the difference in terms of the mental state of the defeat and the draw makes a difference. We need to improve the results, not the performance.\n\n\n\n\nManchester United’s Ashley Young given three-match ban for elbow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“I think when we played our last two matches at home – if I forget the first Burnley goal – the team was solid and played well. It tried to play all the time and took lots of risks; create, tried, never went to direct football.\n“Also because at the moment we don’t have players to allow us to do that I am happy with that quality and that spirit – basically that. We have difficulty now to rotate players.”\nFor Mourinho to declare good fortune over the late Carabao Cup quarter-final defeat at Bristol City indicates the straits he and his side occupy. “The fact that we don’t play a semi-final is a good thing for us. We have no players to play these two possible extra matches in January,” the 54-year-old said. “Now we have to cope with Everton and Derby. After that we have an open space of nine to 10 days before Stoke.\n“Hopefully in this period we can rest, we can work, we can recover some players to attack the second part of the season. We finish the year in third position in the table. We have to fight to improve our position.”\nAs Paul Pogba, who was anonymous again against Southampton, said: “We have to wake up, bounce back and get back to winning.”\n"

This draw with Burnley, following the identical result at Leicester City on Saturday, means Manchester United will trail Manchester City by 15 points should Pep Guardiola’s men beat Newcastle United on Wednesday night.\nIf it is not already, the deficit to United’s great rivals will soon be embarrassing. Given Mourinho’s personal history with Guardiola these are uncomfortable times for the Portuguese and the delirious visiting support signalled so, at one point comparing him unflatteringly with the Catalan.\n\n\n\n\nJosé Mourinho says ‘£300m not enough’ for Manchester United to compete\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs United spent virtually all of the second period camped in Burnley’s half, Mourinho could not fault the effort. The problem is more fundamental: a lack of quality where it counts most, in front of goal. Still, having trailed 2-0 at the break, the comeback to share the points showed spirit, an element their manager hailed.\n“At half-time I need my players to believe in me and accept the risk, not to be afraid to lose three or four, not to be afraid of a possible negative reaction from the supporters,” Mourinho said. “And I’m very happy with their character. Apart from that, also the way they played, they tried to break a very organised wall, I keep saying that to defend well is a quality and they defended very well, so also credit for them to concede only two goals.”\nAfter the “childish decisions” bewailed by Mourinho for allowing Leicester to sneak a late equaliser, he made four changes. Victor Lindelof and Jesse Lingard dropped to the bench and Anthony Martial and the injured Chris Smalling were not in the 18. Marcus Rashford, Marcos Rojo, Luke Shaw and Zlatan Ibrahimovic were drafted in, with the Swede making a first Premier League start this season.\nSean Dyche’s only change from the 3-0 home defeat by Tottenham Hotspur was Ashley Barnes for Chris Wood, who has a knee problem. Burnley started in excellent fashion. Jeff Hendrick forced Rojo into conceding a free-kick down the left and when Johann Berg Gudmundsson swung the ball in a poor defensive header from Romelu Lukaku allowed Barnes to fire Burnley ahead after three minutes.\n\n\n\n\nÁlvaro Morata sets Chelsea on course for victory against stubborn Brighton\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter Mourinho’s latest moan about the schedule in the programme his mood will have darkened further. United’s profligacy cost them at Leicester and they were culpable again in their next attack here. Ibrahimovic’s cross fell precisely for Juan Mata to head but he connected only lightly as Nick Pope’s goal gaped.\nBurnley were proving sharper. When the ball was moved to Gudmundsson down his right corridor the Iceland international was allowed copious time to send in a ball that fell straight on to Scott Arfield’s boot and, though he beat David de Gea, the ball struck the bar.\nAt the other end, Shaw warmed Pope’s fingers with a 25-yard effort and this followed an Ashley Young cross from which Lukaku went close with a header. Then a slick move involving Shaw, Rashford, Ibrahimovic and Mata took United swiftly into the area before Burnley snuffed out the danger by conceding a corner. A second followed quickly but Shaw’s delivery was cleared with ease. Back came United via a strong Young run along the right. He fed Lukaku yet when the centre-forward beat two defenders and stood the cross up, Ibrahimovic’s attempted bicycle kick put off an in-rushing Rashford.\nWhen Burnley next pushed forward they showed United how to finish. Arfield was clattered by Young and from the resulting free-kick 25 yards out in a central position Steven Defour curled the ball beyond De Gea into the top-right corner to double Burnley’s lead.\nBen Mee remained focused enough to prevent United pulling one back moments later. Rashford stole half a yard but his shot was cleared from the goalline by the visiting captain. As the half petered out a quiet Paul Pogba fired an attempt wide, epitomising United’s afternoon.\n\n\n\n\nRoberto Firmino double leads Liverpool’s rout of sorry Swansea\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMourinho made a double substitution for the second half, with Ibrahimovic and Rojo taken off for Lingard and Henrikh Mkhitaryan. Nemanja Matic dropped into Rojo’s centre-back berth, with Lingard and Mkhitaryan operating in midfield in a 4‑1‑4‑1 formation. There was nearly an instant dividend. Young fired in a low cross from the right and Lingard made contact but the effort was deflected on to the bar by a Pope hand. Soon, though, Old Trafford did roar as United found the net. In a near identical move, Young zipped in a cross and this time Lingard scored with a back-heel to the crowd’s delight.\nUnited’s tempo quickened but their hopes of scoring twice more to win the game looked slim against a parsimonious Burnley defence. Mourinho’s men kept possession without really posing a threat to Pope’s goal. A Rashford free-kick from the left that cleared everyone and went straight out was symptomatic. But, with defeat looming, Lingard struck in the first minute of stoppage time to secure a point.\nIt left Dyche content, though. “To come here and get a point is very pleasing,” he said. “It was tough. That was why they have only lost once here this season. You have to remind yourself of them facts. You have to look at the people they brought off the bench.”\nBurnley finished with seven yellow cards, which means a Football Association charge. But Dyche will hardly care.\n"

The Manchester United full-back has been traduced, disparaged and belittled by his own manager on a regular basis since the Portuguese took over at the club and despite getting a rare run-out against CSKA Moscow last week, is believed to want to leave in January. He won’t go cheaply, mind – reports today suggest the 22-year-old is looking for a £5m severance package to compensate for any loss of earnings he might incur should his next club fail to match his current £130,000-per-week wages. Newcastle and Southampton are both interested in giving Shaw a fresh start.\nWhile Mourinho may not rate Shaw, reports over the weekend suggest he thinks highly enough of Sergej Milinkovic-Savic to pay the thick end of £100m for the Lazio and Serbia midfielder next summer. The Serie A side paid Belgian club Genk £16m for Milinkovic-Savic, commonly known as Sergej, two years ago but will expect close to £100m from potential suitors. \n\n\n\n\nThe Dozen: the weekend’s best Premier League photos\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy heck?

Atlético Madrid’s Croatian right-back Sime Vrsaljko and his Paris Saint-Germain counterpart Thomas Meunier have also caught the eye of Juve coach Massimiliano Allegri.\nOlivier Giroud has been told he needs more first-team football to cement a place in France’s World Cup squad and has made no secret of his desire to go on loan in January to get it. Goal-shy clubs such as Southampton, West Ham and Crystal Palace were falling over each other to get him on their books, but Arsène Wenger has let it be known that the man who came off the bench to bag Arsenal’s late equaliser against Southampton is going nowhere. “Is it up to him or up to us?” asked Wenger of the ladies and gentlemen of the Fourth Estate when the subject of Giroud’s future arose yesterday. “It’s up to us. It’s a remarkable achievement what he has done again today. He will start games.”\nCSKA Moscow midfielder Aleksandr Golovin is wanted by Chelsea, who will offer the Russian club £15m for his services in the January transfer window. The 21-year-old from Kaltan in Siberia can play in any midfield position and cites N’Golo Kanté as his favourite defensive midfielder. He also claims to be a fan of Real Madrid and Arsenal; the latter outfit were linked with a move for him last summer and may still be interested in bringing him to the Premier League.\nAnd finally, Nedum Onuoha is wanted by Burnley, but QPR are hoping their captain will sign a new and improved deal to stay with them before his contract expires next summer. Renowned as a model professional who has turned down previous offers to play elsewhere, The Chief returned to action for QPR’s weekend defeat at the hands of Leeds after three months out with a hamstring injury.\n"

        "text": "\nJosé Mourinho knows a thing or two about allowing players to leave a Premier League club only to watch them turn into incredibly influential footballers elsewhere. Isn’t that right Kevin, Mo, Romelu and Nemanja? He hopes to redress the balance slightly – but not by rectifying one of his own mistakes. No, he’ll fix his moody stare on Louis van Gaal, who allowed Jonny Evans to join West Brom for £6m in 2015, as he attempts to pip Manchester City and Arsenal to the centre-back’s signature in the hope he can slot him into the Eric Bailly-shaped hole that exists in his Manchester United back line since the Ivorian’s ankle injury. Mourinho got a good first-hand look at what the 29-year-old can do in Sunday’s 2-1 win at The Hawthorns and believes he’s more than capable of parking a Manchester United bus instead of a West Brom one.\nChelsea will rummage through the ash-strewn remains of Monaco’s squad in January until they find Thomas Lemar, at which moment they’ll leave £50m and a bewildered Michy Batshuayi on the steps of Stade Louis II before whisking the 22-year-old away to Stamford Bridge. And it says here that Juventus are willing to bring the hammer down on the highest bidder for defender Alex Sandro, who Chelsea wanted in the summer. But they’ll face stiff competition from Manchester United, Manchester City and PSG for the £60m-rated player. Wilfried Zaha’s name has also been whispered around Stamford Bridge in recent weeks. \n\n\n\n\nManchester City want Pep Guardiola to create Alex Ferguson-style dynasty\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf Zaha does join Chelsea he may find himself being managed by an Italian other than Antonio Conte. There is some seriously hot gossip doing the rounds that shiny high-end managerial autopilot, Carlo Ancelotti, will return for a second stint at Stamford Bridge. He was sacked in 2011, a season after winning the Double, because that’s football for you. He hasn’t lasted more than two seasons anywhere since but he’s still kept things ticking over to the tune of two league titles, a domestic cup and the Champions League at PSG, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich respectively. Not bad considering for the most part he was doing it with his feet up while looking wistful and smoking multiple cigarettes. And where might Conte end up? Real Madrid, that’s where. \nSam Allardyce has instructed Everton beancounters to find a wad of cash big enough to reunite him with Crystal Palace’s Christian Benteke, having decided that the only way to properly replace a big Belgian striker, is with a big Belgian striker. Allardyce also has the hots for Sevilla’s £35m-rated Steven N’Zonzi but Arsenal are favourites to bring the former Stoke defensive midfielder back to the Premier League. \nIf Benteke does leave Crystal Palace then Roy Hodgson will bid £10m for strapping centre-forward Guido Carrillo, who is also lurking somewhere among the Monaco leftovers (see above). \nJürgen Klopp just can’t get enough of tricky winger-cum-forwards so Liverpool will attempt to prise 20-year-old Federico Chiesa away from Fiorentina for a cool £53m. Spurs are also interested but all the zips on Daniel Levy’s pockets are stuck. Again. One man on his way out of Anfield is former Red Star midfielder Marko Grujic, who can’t even get a game in that one-paced midfield. Aston Villa and Brighton want the 21-year-old on loan. And if Mauricio Pellegrino is still Southampton’s manager in January he says he hasn’t ruled out letting Virgil van Dijk leave. Did you hear that Liverpool fans? \nBarcelona want a ball-playing defender to replace Javier Mascherano. Step forward, um, Daley Blind? Yes, the Manchester United utility player ticks all the Catalan club’s boxes but Internazionale fancy luring him to Serie A, where they too can offer him a role in a proper title race rather than the joyless schlep towards a second-placed finish 1,000 points behind Manchester City he faces being a part of at Old Trafford.\nAnd members of Antoine Griezmann’s family have met with Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu, so expect the Atlético striker to turn up at the Camp Nou in the summer then.\n"

        "text": "\nAfter the tunnel bust-up with Manchester City on Sunday came this muted Manchester United display. They claimed victory but José Mourinho’s side are misfiring as their cross-town rivals continue to coast, winning a record 15th consecutive match at Swansea City.\nThe anomaly about this performance and the virtual no-show on Sunday is how Arsenal were taken apart at their own ground by United in the preceding match. But the requisite quality is lacking for them to consistently dominate.\nUnited are 11 points behind City. Of the title race, Mourinho said: “If it is over now I go on holiday to Brazil or Los Angeles.”\nMourinho also has concerns over Eric Bailly. The centre-back has not played since 5 November, having injured an ankle on duty with Ivory Coast. The manager is hopeful he will not be ruled out for the rest of the season. “I don’t want to be pessimistic, I want to leave it with the doctor,” the Portuguese said.\n“I think it’s serious. We are trying a conservative treatment but if the conservative treatment does not work he might have a surgical procedure. Probably the doctor can inform, it is not a problem for me [for the doctor to clarify] – I don’t want to speak about it. But today we played with [Chris] Smalling and [Phil] Jones, [Victor] Lindelof on the bench, Marcos Rojo is injured but nothing really big. During the season we have problems with central defenders, but Chris Smalling is playing amazingly well, so we are fine.”\n\n\n\n\nDavid Silva leads latest Manchester City masterclass in win at Swansea\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMourinho also faced questions over the continued absence of Henrikh Mkhitaryan, who was a left out of the squad for a seventh time in the past eight matches. Asked to explain the forward’s omission, the manager said: “I can only have six players on the bench and I try to have some balance. I have Ashley Young to cover the wing and full-back position, [Ander] Herrera is a midfield player, Zlatan [Ibrahimovic] is a striker, [Marcus] Rashford is a second striker and a winger. To have Mkhi means I don’t have one of them and I believe the others deserve to be there.”\nBoth Mourinho and Eddie Howe made four changes. For United out went Rojo, Young, Herrera and Rashford and in came Luke Shaw, Phil Jones, Scott McTominay and Juan Mata. For Bournemouth, Dan Gosling, Harry Arter, Adam Smith and Callum Wilson replaced Steve Cook, Lewis Cook, Andrew Surman and Jermain Defoe.\nThe visitors were bright in a high‑tempo start. United had a fluid look, with Lingard once more the No10 and with Mata flitting around from his right-hand berth.\nWilson’s pace appeared Bournemouth’s best hope of turning United and he forced a first corner by leaving Jones on his backside. The ensuing play led to another Bournemouth corner, then a prolonged passage of pressure from the visitors. This climaxed in Gosling selling Shaw a dummy and firing at David de Gea, who beat the ball away.\nOn 25 minutes United struck via Romelu Lukaku. Anthony Martial moved along the left and fed Mata. The Spaniard lifted the ball into the area and United’s No9 rose to head past a leaden-footed Asmir Begovic. Puzzlingly, there was next to nothing of a celebration from Lukaku for what was only his third goal in 15 games, and his first in five in the Premier League.\nLater, Lukaku went on a run that was halted, and United were twice caught offside when in threatening positions, as the half fizzled out. As against City, however, Mourinho’s men had failed to spark.\n\n\n\n\nRiyad Mahrez sparkles as Leicester cruise to win at Southampton\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe question of the second half, then, was whether they would be able to up the entertainment. They began by being boxed in just outside their area, which did not augur well. Still, a sprightly run and cross down the right from Lukaku was encouraging, and Martial made a similar move along the left flank. The Frenchman next pinged a ball in to Lukaku whose touch teed up Mata for a first-time effort which was blocked.\nUnited’s problem was a lack of conviction where it matters: in front of goal. One illustration came when Lukaku teed up Martial but the No11 skied horribly from close range.\nThe Belgian had been booked for a challenge on Harry Arter late in the first half, but Howe believed this should have been a red card, claiming an 18th‑minute challenge on Nathan Ake also deserved a booking. “He should have been off the pitch,” Bournemouth’s manager said.\nUnited managed to cling on until the final whistle – De Gea’s knees repelling a Defoe effort – but all is not well with Mourinho’s team.\n"

        "text": "\nFour brilliant goals, a slightly make-do defence and a thrillingly open away victory: no wonder José Mourinho could be seen looking briefly confused on the Manchester United bench as Ashley Young’s sublime first-half free kick flew into the top corner.\nMourinho’s team were deserved winners at Vicarage Road on a night when they might, Mourinho suggested, have had seven or eight. Poetic licence perhaps but then the idea this United team are built to strangle the life out of their opponents has always been a little awry given the depth of attacking talent, and the brilliance of Paul Pogba when he plays as he did here.\n\n\n\n\nJamie Vardy sparks Leicester victory as Tottenham Hotspur slip up again\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnited had looked like running away from Watford as Ashley Young enjoyed an early festive return to Vicarage Road, scoring two lovely goals. The home team never gave up though, dragging it back to 3-2 before Jesse Lingard took the game away with a sublime late fourth goal, weaving his way from his own half to finish in front of a delirious away end.\nThis match had been billed as a meeting of young, hopeful Portuguese tyro and old, toxic Portuguese grandmaster. In the event it was a messy, fun affair in front of a boisterous crowd. Vicarage Road has been steadily wrestled into gleaming Premier League shape, with the new stand looming along one side, the groovy looking fishbowl-style boxes in each corner and that close, crackly atmosphere you only get in an urban ground packed in between houses.\nUnited have a tricky run ahead and this felt like a vital game from the start such is the pressure of Manchester City’s white heat at the top of the table and the clinch already for the remaining Champions League spots.\n\n\n \n\n\nPlay Video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1:46\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Mourinho: 'No complaints with Lukaku' – video\n\n\nMourinho gave Marcus Rashford a rest after four games in 14 days. United also made the expected shift to three at the back, a common ploy against opponents who tend to set up that way.\nThere may have been more illustrious backlines in United’s history than a depleted Rojo-Smalling-Lindelof and Watford set out to press high early on. At times Richarlison likes to man-mark one of the centre-halves and he ran at Victor Lindelof early on, all eager, bounding menace.\nRicharlison narrowly failed to get a toe on Kiko Femenía’s low cross from the right as Watford started with energy and enterprise. Abdoulaye Doucouré and Will Hughes had an early grip of midfield. Marvin Zeegelaar, wearing his special I’ve-met-Andy Carroll white face mask, was a threat on the right.\nAt which point United killed the game. It was brutal, high-class, and helped by some surprisingly scruffy defending. The first goal arrived after 19 minutes via a brilliant piece of opportunism from Young. Lingard made a nice run through the centre-forward position. The ball broke to Femenía, who failed to control it. Young swung his right foot, connected sweetly and pinged a low, hard, daisy-cutter past Heurelho Gomes into the corner.\nIt was Young’s first goal away from Old Trafford since March 2015. Six minutes later he had his second. Pogba set off on a driving run through the heart of the midfield. Doucouré dragged him back. And from 25 yards Young sidled up and curled a wonderful free-kick into the top corner, a perfect execution from a player who scored a few of those for Watford a decade ago.\nYoung was recently offered a new contract that could keep him at United until the age of 34. Not a bad Indian summer for a player who was famously rejected by the Watford academy for being too small.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Jesse Lingard, left, twists through the Watford defence before scoring Manchester United’s fourth goal. Photograph: Matt Dunham/AP\n\n\nOn 32 minutes it was 3-0. This time it was Christian Kabasele who failed to clear. The ball fell to Lingard. He nudged an instant pass to Anthony Martial, who ran on and finished expertly.\nThe away end gurgled with delight, Watford’s heads dropped and for a while Pogba seemed to have complete control of midfield, always ready to find the right pass.\n\n\n\n\nJosé Mourinho delighted by Manchester United’s firepower at Watford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLingard should have scored but saw Gomes make a brilliant, sprawling save. Richarlison hit the top of the bar with a header but at half-time Watford trooped off looking utterly drained, picked off by United’s razor edge.\nThe home side threw themselves gamely into the second half, although they might have been picked off on the break, too, as Pogba continued to link the play with real elan. Nemanja Matic limped off, as did a disconsolate Hughes, followed by Martial, rested for the trip to Arsenal on Saturday. Romelu Lukaku really should have scored, delaying too long in front of a near-open goal.\nBut with 77 minutes gone Watford had a penalty as Marcos Rojo hacked down Roberto Pereyra. Troy Deeney tucked it into the corner. As Vicarage Road roared Doucouré pulled another back with a neat low shot before Lingard’s grandstand finish.\n"

        "text": "\nManchester United want to sign Gareth Bale from Real Madrid and are not put off by the forward’s injury problems because they believe they would be able to improve his condition.\nBale has missed 40 of Real’s last 60 matches because of injury. He has not played since late September and is expected to be out for a further month and a half after suffering a thigh problem last week when he was nearing a return from calf trouble.\n\n\n\n\nManchester United cancel David Icke show at Old Trafford after backlash\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat was the Wales international’s 19th injury since he joined Real in September 2013 for a then world record £85m but it is understood this is not a concern for United. José Mourinho has previously tried to bring Bale to Old Trafford and remains keen to do so, though any bid is expected next summer rather than in January.\nUnited are encouraged by Bale’s better appearance record when at Tottenham Hotspur and believe they could return him to a similar level of games. He played 52 matches in the season before his move to Madrid, 48 the campaign before and 44 in 2010-11. Bale earns about £350,000 a week after tax and is contracted until 2022. He has a €1bn (£890m) buyout clause but given his injury issues Real would demand considerably less if they wanted to sell him.\nUnited’s injury problems are easing, with Paul Pogba, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Marcos Rojo available for Saturday’s home game against Newcastle United. Mourinho picked out Pogba’s absence as a particular hardship for the team.\nPogba pulled a hamstring during the 3-0 Champions League win over Basel on 12 September. United were unbeaten at that point but surrendered that record when losing 2-1 at Huddersfield a month later. They also lost at Chelsea in the last match before the international break. Ibrahimovic and Rojo have been out since April with knee injuries..\nMourinho said: “Now I can speak because Paul is back but you can clearly see Manchester United this season before Paul’s injury and after Paul’s injury. There are qualities in our football that influence our approach in matches, with Pogba and without Pogba, that’s as simple as that.”\nIbrahimovic ended last season as United’s top scorer with 28 goals, despite his campaign ending early.\nMourinho said: “Zlatan last season we played with him every minute almost until he was injured. This season we learn how to play without him but he’s a very important player. We welcome him back.\n“He has an incredible personality to fight such an important injury. We were all saying in 2017 he will be back but one thing is 31 December 2017 and another thing is mid-November. He was as an injured player the same super professional he is when he’s fit.\n“So fantastic work – same as Marcos, who had a serious injury too, a big surgery. He played with the young boys [the reserves] on Wednesday and is fine, is confident, is also ready. Paul is obviously not the same dimension, was not a surgical situation but was also bad and all three are back.”\nOf the 36-year-old Ibrahimovic, Mourinho added: “You cannot expect him to play 90 minutes or consecutive matches like he did all his career. Now he needs time to be back for his level, his fitness, his confidence, everything, his sharpness, but by the clinical point of view it is fantastic to be ready.”\nUnited are in second place, eight points behind Manchester City. Mourinho pointed to the two derby games as vital if they are to catch City.\n“I am confident that tomorrow we can win against Newcastle, and that is the way we have to look at it: to play every match thinking we can win and to think we play against City in two matches where we can interfere with the situation,” he said. “All the other matches Manchester City plays we cannot interfere with. We can watch it, we can agree with some referee decisions in their matches, yes or no. But we can’t interfere.”\n"

        "text": "\nHaving been one of the mainstays of Chelsea’s title-winning campaign last season, this season David Luiz played all but three minutes of the first eight league games for which he was available (there was also a two-match suspension), then got dropped once and suddenly he’s ready to flounce out of the club altogether. He is, report the Star in their back-page exclusive, “said to be extremely unhappy following his bust-up with Antonio Conte” and also “frustrated that the club’s hierarchy have not backed him” and therefore “could be set for a reunion with José Mourinho”. That’s right, the grumpy Portuguese tactician “is ready to step in” and whisk the centre-back to Manchester, caring not a hoot that Chelsea are “sure to want at least the £34m they paid” for the frizz-faced ace. And Luiz is happy to work once again with Mourinho, who sidelined him at Chelsea, played him out of position or more frequently not at all, and then shipped him out to Paris.\nMeanwhile it’s a hearty welcome back to the Mill for our old friend Virgil van Dijk, who is set to be the subject of yet another couple of months of interminable speculation. Yesterday his current manager, Mauricio Pellegrino, was asked if he could guarantee that there would be no move for the centre-back in the January transfer window and responded by starting to squirm. “I don’t know. I can’t control the market. You never know, because when we talk about money everybody has got a price,” he squeaked. “I can’t decide about that. This is a question for our owners.” Thus Van Dijk appears on the back page of the Mirror, who assert in loudest, brightest, largest headline fonts that as far as Liverpool and Jürgen Klopp are concerned he could be “yours for £70m”, and that Pellegrino’s response amounts to “a green light to make a January bid”.\n\n\n\n\nPremier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManchester United’s Luke Shaw, another Mill regular, is going nowhere anytime soon, reports the Telegraph. “A move away in January, even on loan, appears unlikely,” they declare, “but a decision is expected to be made on the player’s future in the summer, giving him the rest of the season to” harrumph around Carrington mournfully while being totally ignored by a manager who has already decided that he’s useless – or, as the article itself puts it, “show his worth”. Managerless Everton, meanwhile, will battle Milan for the services of Dynamo Kyiv’s Domagoj Vida, who they can have for nothing because his contract is about to end.\nSporting Lisbon have informed West Ham that they can have William Carvalho if they want, so long as they also want to pay them £28m. This represents an intriguing return to cordiality for two clubs whose bickering over the same player’s possible transfer in the summer culminated in the Portuguese club’s president, Bruno de Carvalho, describing the Hammers’ co-owners, David Sullivan and David Gold, as “the dildo brothers”. According to the Express, David Moyes “has been promised funds for up to four players in January”, so Carvalho would be just the start of a grander spree.\nMK Dons, the team from which Tottenham plucked Dele Alli not so long ago, have another little flower growing. Dylan Asonganyi has scored 20 goals in 17 games so far this season for the club’s Under-18 and Under-23 teams, creating such a blossoming reputation that his most recent game – against Barnet in the FA Youth Cup on Tuesday night, in which he scored twice in a 3-1 win – was attended by representatives of both Manchester giants, Arsenal, Tottenham, Chelsea and Leicester. Meanwhile Everton and Arsenal are among “a number of Premier League clubs” who are monitoring Middlesbrough’s 18-year-old winger Marcus Tavernier. “Bournemouth and Aston Villa are known admirers too,” report the Mail. And Manchester United want West Ham’s 17-year-old midfielder Domingos Quina, for whom despite his youth United would be a fourth major club, in a third country: born in Guinea-Bissau, he has already spent time in the youth systems of Benfica and Chelsea.\n"

After scoring 32 goals in 48 games last season, the 21-year-old was courted by West Ham, Arsenal and Chelsea, among others, but remained at Celtic Park for this season’s Champions League campaign. L’Equipe report that the France U-21 international has already begun talks with United with a view to moving to Old Trafford next summer. Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers is resigned to losing Dembélé and the striker is likely to have no shortage of suitors.\nThe French sports daily also claim that PSG have offered Manchester United totem pole Marouane Fellaini a four-year deal and say Liverpool are interested in rescuing Julian Draxler from his Parisian purgatory in January. The 24-year-old has struggled for game time with the Ligue 1 leaders since they signed Kylian Mbappé and Neymar in the summer and may miss out on a spot in Germany’s World Cup squad if he doesn’t secure a move elsewhere.\n\n\n\n\nProspering promoted sides precipitated Premier League clubs’ rush to sack | Paul Wilson\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCloser to home, the Mirror reports that PSG will move for Alexis Sánchez in January, but will have to fend off competition from Real Madrid and Manchester City to get a playmaker they really, really don’t need on board.

Ahmed Musa and Leonardo Ulloa could also be headed for the Leicester City door marked “do one”.\n Internazionale midfielder João Mário has fallen out of favour at the San Siro and could be sold to Arsenal in January. The Portuguese midfielder has dropped down the Inter pecking order since his £40m move from Sporting 18 months ago and has a fan in Arsène Wenger, who could sign him for as “little” as £25m in January. Mário is seen a potential replacement for Mesut Özil, who could be on his way to Barcelona.\n To the managerial merry-go-round, where Alan Pardew looks set to benefit from West Brom’s stunning lack of imagination when it comes to replacing Tony Pulis, while Hull City are ready to part company with Leonid Slutsky.

So spare a thought for Mesut Özil, who has been living that twin hell for some time now. Happily for the Germany midfielder, salvation may be on its way with news that Atlético Madrid are interested in acquiring his talents.\nThe Spanish club have reportedly contacted Özil over a possible move in the summer, when his contract expires and he can finally rid himself of those long think-pieces focusing on whether or not he’s actually any good. Atlético are thought to be willing to offer Özil a salary of £200,000 a week, alongside a hefty signing-on fee, and should the 29-year-old say “si”, it would bring a return to Madrid following his three-year spell at Real prior to joining Arsenal in September 2013.\nOne player who could be making a sortofnotreallybutwe’vestartedsowe’llfinish opposite move is Saúl Ñíguez. Manchester United are supposedly keen on signing Atlético’s attacking midfielder as cover for Paul Pogba. The Frenchman has been out of action since mid-September with a hamstring injury and, while bravely refusing to cry about it, José Mourinho has reportedly decided he needs to bring in another body if United are to maintain their twin assault on the Premier League and Champions League. Saúl fits the bill, with Mourinho a long-term admirer of the 22-year-old Spanish tyro.\n\n\n\n\nScotland ready to make Michael O’Neill a double-your-money offer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother man who could be on his way to Old Trafford in January is the Argentinian left-back Enzo Diaz. The 21-year-old plays for the second division leaders Agropecuario and has impressed United’s scouts, with the player keen for a deal to happen. “It is the dream of any footballer to play for Manchester United,” Diaz told local hacks. “However, I need to remain focused on what we are doing and enjoying this moment.” Wise words Enzo, wise words. \nElsewhere, Liverpool are keen on re-signing Suso from Milan should Philippe Coutinho join Barcelona in January. Brendan Rodgers fans will remember that Suso played under the Northern Irishman during his time in charge at Anfield and impressed on occasions having come through the club’s academy. However, he was deemed not quite good enough and subsequently sold in 2015. Since then, the Spaniard has shone and could now be heading back – but only if Coutinho jumps ship early and Liverpool are prepared to pay Suso’s buyout clause, which is said to be in the £35m region.\nStaying with Liverpool and it appears Danny Ings’s time there is coming to an end. The striker has been linked with a loan move to West Ham in January, having struggled to make an impact on Merseyside due to a combination of terrible injury luck and other strikers being ahead of him in the pecking order. David Moyes was reportedly keen on signing Ings during his time at Real Sociedad and could make the 25-year-old his first acquisition now he has replaced Slaven Bilic.\nThe bad news for Ings should he decide to join West Ham is that he may not get the chance to play alongside Arthur Masuaku. The left-back, who joined from Olympiacos for £6.2m in August 2016, is wanted by Napoli, Juventus, Milan and Genoa, and is keen on joining at least one of them in the new year, according to the 24-year-old’s agent, Francesco Lingenti. Speaking to CalcioNapoli24.it, he is reported as saying: “Serie A is our objective and hopefully he [Masuaku] will be there in January. However, he’d only go to Juventus if they sold Alex Sandro.”\nAnd finally, Brighton and Southampton are both interested in signing Aleksandar Mitrovic. The Serbia striker is struggling to get a game under Rafael Benítez at Newcastle United and could now be on the verge of moving from one end of the country to another.\n"

        "text": "\nHe may have steered Southampton to an eighth place finish in the Premier League last season, but in doing so Claude Puel seemed to leave regulars at Saint Mary’s decidedly underwhelmed by the manner in which he went about his work. The Frenchman’s on-pitch tactics were widely reported to be a reflection of his personality off it: quietly efficient but decidedly dull. Ultimately, they cost him his job in the summer, despite the decent league position and an appearance in a League Cup final Southampton were unlucky not to win. Nevertheless, it seems Leicester City are of the opinion that Puel’s is the safe pair of hands the club needs to steady a ship that had begun listing under Craig Shakespeare and he has emerged as a surprise contender to take over at the King Power Stadium. The 56-year-old is the new odds-on favourite to be next manager of Leicester and is reported by several newspapers to be in talks about who would make up his backroom team, a state of affairs that suggests the job is his to turn down.\n\n\n\n\nSlaven Bilic admits West Ham players do not run enough in games\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAntonio Conte’s future as Chelsea manager looks increasingly bleak, with reports in Italy suggesting the club have already sounded out Napoli manager Maurizio Sarri as a potential replacement for the man who won the title last season. With Napoli leading Serie A, Chelsea could offer Sarri €12m a year to abandon his tilt at the title, while Milan are understood to be monitoring Conte’s situation after their poor start to the season. Having been binned off by Bayern Munich, Carlo Ancelotti was linked with the Milan gig, but he could be off to China to replace Luis Felipe Scolari, who is ready to leave his post at Guangzhou Evergrande.\nGerman newspaper Bild say both Manchester United and Arsenal are mulling over the possibility of bringing Marco Reus to the Premier League. Having raised eyebrows with his surprise decision to snub Bayern Munich for Borussia Dortmund when leaving Borussia Mönchengladbach in 2012, the German winger’s career has been severely disrupted by injuries that were directly or indirectly responsible for him missing out on World Cup 2014 and Euro 2016. The 28-year-old winger is currently out until around March with a cruciate knee ligament injury and it is thought Dortmund might cash in on him next summer, rather than let him run down his contract and let him leave for a free a year later.\nESPN have been scanning the Spanish press and note that the Barcelona-based newspaper Sport has made some bold but not entirely implausible claims about life at Liverpool. They say the relationship between Philippe Coutinho and Liverpool manager Jürgen Klopp is fractured beyond repair after the latter blocked the former’s move to Barcelona during the summer. Reporter Joaquim Piera also claims that Klopp threatened to resign if the Liverpool board agreed to sell Coutinho and that the club subsequently fabricated the back injury cited as the reason for the Brazilian’s absence from their Champions League play-off against injury in order to give both parties a chance to spend time apart and cool down. You remember it; the one that cleared up just in time to allow Coutinho to play for Brazil and score a splendid goal against Ecuador in a World Cup qualifier. Sport go on to say that Coutinho remains eager to leave Liverpool for Barcelona and would ideally like to do so in January.\nNo longer in the Porto first team and with the club eager to get him off their wage bill, former Real Madrid skipper Iker Casillas could be available to interested parties for a small fee in January and might constitute a good bit of business for a Premier League club. West Brom, Watford and Newcastle are all in the market for a goalkeeper and are understood to be interested in Wayne Hennessey, who is not enjoying the best of times at Crystal Palace.\n"

        "text": "\nThis is the kind of result to stifle talk of crisis at Chelsea. The Premier League’s summit may remain distant but the joyous din which erupted inside the ground at the final whistle was an outpouring of relief. Antonio Conte celebrated manically, fists raised in triumph towards those in the upper tier of the East stand, before striding out on to the pitch to acknowledge each side of the ground in turn. José Mourinho waited near the tunnel to shake his counterpart’s hand but eventually gave up. He looked distinctly unimpressed to be enduring Conte’s moment.\nIt may seem vaguely ludicrous that a head coach who has now overseen 37 wins from his 49 Premier League games in charge could be considered under pressure but Conte had needed this victory. That humiliation in Rome in midweek had left him embattled, with suggestions the hierarchy had not taken kindly to the realism with which he has approached a cluttered campaign, and the first murmurings of discontent within the playing squad surfacing with every setback.\nYet against imposing opponents in Manchester United, and not for the first time since he arrived in England, his major decisions paid off: his side played with the same system, style and swagger as at Atlético Madrid in September; N’Golo Kanté’s reintegration in midfield was key to a second clean sheet in nine games; Andreas Christensen, preferred to David Luiz in the middle of the back three, was mightily impressive.\n\n\n\n\nGabriel Jesus strikes from the bench as rampant Manchester City see off Arsenal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Brazilian had worn heavy strapping on his right leg at the Stadio Olimpico but had been omitted here for “tactical reasons”, according to Conte, with the implication it was down to shoddy form. The Italian had pointed pre-match to Christensen’s early-season displays and to the fact “the club likes to bring in a young player” when it came to Ethan Ampadu, a 17-year-old without any experience of top-flight football, being preferred on the bench over David Luiz.\nAfter the match Conte suggested David Luiz would have “to work really hard, or [risk to] be on the bench or in the stand”. As it was, the defender sat behind the dugouts next to his compatriot Kenedy, whose yawn in Thursday’s debrief had been noted, and watched his team-mates put in their most convincing display for more than a month. It will be intriguing to see how such a charismatic figure now forces his way back into the fold. Certainly his team-mates have demonstrated they can do without him.\nIt was tempting to wonder whether Mourinho’s presence in the dugout had merely coaxed the best from Chelsea, as it once did so often when he was on the payroll. His current team never showed any real control on this occasion, their few chances squeezed out on the break – they mustered only two on target all afternoon – until a late rally which threatened to earn them an equaliser they would not have merited. Their own gap from Manchester City is now eight points, which “is not the same as eight points in the Portuguese league, La Liga, the Bundesliga”‚ according to the manager.\n\n\n\n\nSon Heung-min seals laboured Tottenham win over Crystal Palace\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe disappointment was in their inability to wound their hosts, with Marouane Fellaini’s late volley, turned away smartly by Thibaut Courtois, the closest they came to reward. Marcus Rashford’s was a pesky presence but there was no real rhythm to their approach and, without their injured absentees, they were forced too often into retreat. Romelu Lukaku, one spin and shot from distance aside, was isolated and contained. Teams far less imposing than United have created considerably more against these opponents this term, and that ended up feeling rather damning.\nAdmittedly Kanté’s energetic presence was significant and inevitably bolstered Chelsea’s collective. The champions had kept only one clean sheet during his six-game absence, with a hamstring injury sustained on international duty with France. Yet it was the home side’s attacking play which truly caught the eye. Their goal had been forged in familiar fashion, César Azpilicueta flinging over one of those trademark diagonal crosses from which Diego Costa and Álvaro Morata have benefited in recent times. The Spaniard met it emphatically, having trundled unnoticed into the space between United’s centre-halves with Chris Smalling drawn towards Tiémoué Bakayoko’s run, to plant his header beyond a static David de Gea and leave Mourinho cursing another miserable homecoming.\nBut Chelsea should have had more to show for their dominance. The excellent Eden Hazard, whose ankles had been kicked raw by the end, was denied regularly by De Gea, Cesc Fàbregas nodded into the side-netting from close range, Bakayoko missed two glorious opportunities and the referee, Anthony Taylor, penalised Morata for a push on Phil Jones early on after the defender had inadvertently conjured a volley as he crumpled clumsily which arrowed the ball into the top corner.\nEach miss had left Conte agonised on the touchline, his impatience drawing warnings from the fourth official, Craig Pawson, for encroachment as Mourinho watched on, presumably wondering if he would be treated quite so leniently. But this was the Italian’s day. “We can win or lose but our spirit must be this,” said Conte. “We started this season with a lot of problems. We were up and down. But this game showed that, if we want it, we can do it.”\n"

        "text": "\nWith one-time West Ham flop Simone Zaza banging in goals for fun, Valencia’s resurgence is one of the more interesting football talking points in Spain this season. Managed by Marcelino García Toral, Los Che are unbeaten, sit second in La Liga and last night won their fifth consecutive match with a 4-0 thrashing of Sevilla. Small wonder, then, that their footballers are attracting attention from elsewhere. Central midfielder Carlos Soler is one such player and reports over the weekend suggest that Manchester United have opened talks with Valencia over a £30m deal for the Spain Under-21 international.\nDespite only making his Valencia debut last December, Soler has quickly established himself as a first team regular having come through the club’s youth system and is already being touted as a future Spain superstar. Though he has a £75m buy-out clause in his contract, he will almost certainly go for less, with Valencia being strapped for cash and likely to let him go for less than half that amount.\n\n\n\n\nPremier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s action\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiverpool striker Danny Ings is approaching full fitness after spending the best part of two years on the sidelines and may go on loan in January in the hope of securing the kind of regular first team action that might earn him a place in England’s World Cup squad. Watford, Crystal Palace, Southampton and Newcastle are all rumoured to be interested in the front man, who will find it difficult to break into Liverpool’s first team unless he reinvents himself as a goalkeeper or accomplished central defender.\nBarcelona and Arsenal are ready to duke it out in the scrap to sign Milan striker André Silva. The 21-year-old only signed for the Serie A side from Porto last summer and has scored seven goals this season – four for Milan in the Europa League and three for the Portugal national team.\nSouthampton are ready to renew their interest in Napoli defender Kalidou Koulibaly in January, but will face stiff competition in the battle to secure the Senegal central defender’s scrawl. Chelsea, Everton and Barcelona are also interested in signing the in-demand Koulibaly, who seems unlikely to leave Napoli as long as their title chase remains on track. \nArturo Vidal is surplus to requirements at Bayern Munich and is wanted by Inter, Arsenal, Chelsea and Liverpool. An undeniably talented player who “likes to drink and doesn’t control himself”, according to former Chile coach Jorge Sampaoli, Vidal should prove a challenging project for whichever manager ends up coaching him.\nLiverpool and Juventus are both interested in signing 18-year-old midfielder Manor Solomon from Israeli side Maccabi Petah Tikva. Italian media reports suggest the player could change hands for around €5m. \nAnd finally, Tottenham Hotspur fans will be unimpressed to learn that Real Madrid have identified Mauricio Pochettino as a possible successor for Zinedine Zidane. The popular Argentinian has yet to win anything with Spurs, but has turned them into one of the most eye-catching young teams in Europe in his three years at the helm. Contracted to Spurs until 2021, he has thus far given every indication that he is in north London for the long haul.\n"

        "text": "\nThe memories of Manchester United in 1985-86 and Newcastle United in 1995-96 serve always as caveats, but already it feels that it would take something outlandish for Manchester City not to be named as champions this season. Perhaps their slick cogs and gears will somehow stick or grind, but at the moment none of the chasing pack are applying pressure. The gap already is eight points and, once again, on Sunday, it was hard to avoid the thought that there has been something meek in the way José Mourinho has presented the initiative to his rivals.\nWhen United defeated Ajax to win the Europa League, Mourinho spoke of it as a victory for pragmatism. It is a term that is frequently applied to his football, and football generally has a tendency to use pragmatic as a synonym for defensive. But they are not the same: a pragmatist does what is necessary to win; Mourinho insists on reactive football again and again, even when it means losing ground. The three games in the past month against top-six sides were always likely to represent a decisive phase of the season. In them United totalled six shots on target – and that suggests an approach that is not pragmatic, but is rather stubbornly dogmatic.\n\n\n\n\n‘I never shut the door on England’: Ashley Young relishing his return\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, this was Chelsea and, yes, they are the defending champions. But City came to Stamford Bridge, dominated the game and won 1-0. United, frankly, never looked like winning. They were not as defensive as they had been in the FA Cup tie here last season when they fielded a back six, but nor was there ever a thought of them taking the game to Chelsea as Pep Guardiola had, of trying to expose a defence that had been given such a tough time in recent games by Roma (twice) and Watford.\nChelsea with N’Golo Kanté, admittedly, are a different proposition to Chelsea without him, and there was no question that Antonio Conte’s side improved with his return after injury. But still, it was hard to see how United ever planned to hurt Chelsea.\nEarly on, as Ander Herrera was lured towards Eden Hazard, Tiémoué Bakayoko, playing on the left of Chelsea’s midfield triangle, kept finding space to charge into. Which might in itself have been decisive had he not been Tiémoué Bakayoko and therefore lacking the composure that might have turned those opportunities into goals. That avenue, though, was soon closed down, with Phil Jones and, particularly, Eric Bailly stepping out to close down Hazard, leaving Herrera to block the channel Bakayoko had been exploiting.\nThe use of a back three gave United the option of pushing one of the central defenders out to deal with Hazard and preventing just that problem, but the issues that had cropped up against Tottenham Hotspur last week recurred. Much was played long to the two forwards, which effectively diminished Henrikh Mkhitaryan’s role to the point that he may as well not have been there. The Armenian’s 62 minutes on the pitch yielded just 29 touches – although that was at least five more than an isolated Romelu Lukaku managed in a full game.\nAnd then there was the issue of the midfield. Even excluding Hazard, who occasionally dropped deep, Chelsea had three central midfielders there. United had two plus Mkhitaryan, which meant they were occasionally overmanned, a problem exacerbated by the fact that Chelsea’s wing-backs were, understandably, more aggressive. That was what led to the first Bakayoko chance, as Davide Zappacosta got in behind Ashley Young, and it was a shortfall on that flank that led to the goal. Young was forced deep to prevent Zappacosta making a similar run behind him and as Chelsea switched the ball quickly from their left to right, César Azpilicueta was able to stride forward into space and measure his cross for Álvaro Morata.\nMourinho almost immediately changed tack, went to a 4-3-3, and United became more threatening as a result, while suddenly becoming vulnerable again to those Bakayoko surges. Marouane Fellaini, back after a knee injury, spread the kind of chaos he always does, and nearly equalised. But, whatever absentees United have – Mourinho once again reluctantly listed the injured Paul Pogba, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Marcos Rojo – it remains bewildering that United can seem so reliant on the Belgian bag of elbows for anything approximating to creativity.\nUnited, in fairness, were probably more proactive here than they had been against either Liverpool or Tottenham. But in the context of dropped points against Liverpool and Huddersfield, it was not enough.\n"

The centre-forward created Anthony Martial’s 81st-minute winner and Mourinho also pointed to how the Belgian presented difficulty for Toby Alderweireld and Jan Vertonghen.\n\n\n\n\nPremier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s action\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The fans are the fans and I also told [on Saturday] that the fans pay for their tickets and are free to express themselves the way they want to express,” Mourinho said. “But my job, when I feel they deserve it, is to protect my players. Romelu is one of the players that should be untouchable in terms of the respect of everyone. It’s not one goal or the ball goes against the post or a save by the opposition keeper that can make Romelu’s contribution below the top level.\n“He is playing extremely well for us and yes I have to protect my players when I feel they deserve it. And Romelu always deserves it because what he does for the team is fantastic. Playing football for a striker isn’t just about scoring goals. So for me [he is] untouchable in my team and I think he should be untouchable in support from the fans. But fans are fans, they pay the ticket and do what they want. As a manager I feel duty to protect my players when I feel they deserve it.\n“Ask Vertonghen and Alderweireld if he was quiet, and they are some of the best centre-backs in football. I don’t think he’s quiet at all. The point is scoring or not scoring because in the end that is what people analyse sometimes.”\nUnited welcome Benfica in Tuesday’s fourth Champions League Group A match as leaders with maximum points. If United win they are guaranteed qualification for the knockout stage. They go to Chelsea on Sunday in the Premier League but Mourinho said: “Nobody here thinks about another match than Benfica. Nobody here thinks about Chelsea. So it’s just Benfica, Champions League and only Champions League.”\nOn the achievement of potentially qualifying after four matches, Mourinho said: “Manchester United was eliminated by Basel and PSV Eindhoven [in the group stages in 2011 and 2015 respectively] but I think it is quite a logical consequence of evolution. We played the Europa League and won it. My team are now playing in the Champions League and we are now much better than last year or three years ago.”\n"

        "text": "\nBelgium right-back Thomas Meunier is getting itchy feet at Paris Saint-Germain, where he has started only six of the club’s 11 league matches and is yet to feature in the Champions League. Increasingly tired of playing second fiddle to Dani Alves, Meunier would be open to a move away from the French capital and speculation abounds that Manchester United are preparing a £30m offer for the 26-year-old, who is contracted to PSG until 2020. So famous that the club’s former director of football Patrick Kluivert failed to recognise him while travelling in the same car as the player on a pre-season tour shortly after he’d signed for the club, Meunier has since become well known enough to have attracted interest from Real Madrid and Juventus, as well as United. He could move in January.\n\n\n\n\nDavid Unsworth left wondering what he’s got himself into as Everton caretaker | Sachin Nakrani\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManchester United are also reported to be interested in bringing Real midfielder Casemiro to Old Trafford, where Michael Carrick has been restricted to only one Carabao Cup appearance for the club this season. The long-serving midfielder is suffering from a mysterious ailment that apparently left him feeling dizzy and nauseous back in September and has since resurfaced in training. Assuming United’s medical staff can get to the bottom of the problem, West Brom, Leicester and Aston Villa are interested in securing his services should he end up being surplus to requirements at Old Trafford. \nAndré Gomes is no longer wanted by Barcelona, having failed to impress since moving to the club from Valencia. The 24-year-old is likely to have no shortage of suitors, with Manchester United, Tottenham Hotspur and Juventus all understood to be circling. Depending on which contradictory reports from Spain you believe, Juventus have either cooled or ramped up their interest in the midfielder, a state of affairs that proves Hollywood screenwriter William Goldman’s theory that “nobody knows anything”. \n The saga surrounding the future of Philippe Coutinho rumbles on and on, with TF1 saying PSG will do battle with Barcelona for his signature next summer if the Brazilian hasn’t already gone to the Camp Nou in the meantime. The French television station claims that PSG sporting director Alan Henrique has held talks with Coutinho’s agent, Kia Joorabchian, to discuss a potential move to Paris next summer, teeing up what could be the mother of all spite-fuelled bidding wars between two clubs whose relationship has soured since the French club’s audacious smash-and-grab for Neymar back in August. The most likely winners of what would be a very unseemly summer peeing contest? Joorabchian, Coutinho and Liverpool, of course.\nIpswich Town midfielder Tristan Nydam is wanted by Arsenal, who could sign the 17-year-old for £2m in January and immediately loan him back to the club he has represented 12 times already this season. In other Young Tyro news, the Gunners are also ready to offer their comparatively elderly striker Eddie Nketiah, 18, a new and improved five-year deal worth £15,000 per week as a reward for his Carabao Cup brace against Norwich City last week.\nAnd finally, the managerial merry-go-round is spinning so fast it’s making the Rumour Mill dizzy – but it will slow down for long enough to let David Moyes alight to go manage Burnley should Sean Dyche take the vacant Everton manager’s job. \n"

        "text": "\nJosé Mourinho commended Manchester United’s response after they coasted into the quarter-finals courtesy of two superb goals by Jesse Lingard. The holders and five-times winners comfortably picked off Swansea City.\nMourinho had questioned the attitude of his players after the Premier League defeat at Huddersfield Town on Saturday but this thoroughly professional display from a much changed and youthful United left him satisfied. “The attitude was good,” the Portuguese said after what was his 400th match in English football.\nUnited’s performance was slick and on another day Lingard would have left with the match ball. “I’m disappointed not to get the hat-trick because I always want more goals,” he said. “We had to put things right but we have learned from the weekend and we want to move on.”\n\n\n\n\nCarabao Cup roundup: Bristol City thrash Palace to reach quarter-finals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis was the second time Mourinho’s side had eased past Swansea in three months but Daley Blind was the only survivor from the team that started a 4-0 win in August.\nSwansea’s manager, Paul Clement, said he had discussed United’s defeat at Huddersfield with his players but it probably bore little relevance given Mourinho made seven changes. There were starts for the academy graduates Scott McTominay and Axel Tuanzebe, on the club’s books since aged eight and five respectively.\n“I think they both did well,” Mourinho added later. “I would say Scott did very well because he was really comfortable and strong in midfield. Axel started a little bit shaky but then got stability – today his good performance was the consequence of a good team.”\nDespite the changes there was still no start for Luke Shaw, who was named among the substitutes, alongside Romelu Lukaku and Henrik Mkhitaryan. Shaw came on for the final four minutes but the 22-year-old, who became the world’s most expensive teenager in 2014 after arriving from Southampton for £30m, has played only 49 minutes this season. His future remains increasingly uncertain.\nClement made eight changes to the side that lost at home to Leicester City on Saturday. Oli McBurnie, prolific for the under-23 side, led the line, while Roque Mesa, a £11m summer signing from Las Palmas made his fourth start, wearing the No51 shirt. His manager described his performance as “average”.\nAfter criticising his players for failing to compete at Huddersfield, Mourinho demanded they rise to the challenge. They made a fast start, with Chris Smalling outjumping Alfie Mawson to power a header wide from Marcus Rashford’s corner. Then Lingard forced Kristoffer Nordfeldt to tip over before he slid in Anthony Martial, who failed to gain control of the ball. United did not have to wait too long for a goal, with Lingard scoring a beautiful opener after 21 minutes.\nAnder Herrera fizzed a ball into the feet of Rashford, whose classy first-time flick ran straight through the legs of Mike van der Hoorn and into the path of Lingard. Bearing down on Nordfeldt, he curled the ball low into the corner of the Swansea goal. Lingard’s trademark Drake-inspired flute celebration immediately followed.\nThings went from bad to worse for Swansea seven minutes before the interval when Martin Olsson was forced off with a hamstring injury. In the buildup, Clement had bemoaned his lack of cover at left-back. “If there is an issue, who would be able to step in?” he said at the time.\n\n\n\n\nLeicester’s Kelechi Iheanacho and Islam Slimani hit form to sink Leeds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSwansea only really troubled United from distance until the substitute Leroy Fer forced Sergio Romero into a smart save from close range in injury time. “They had the extra bit of quality, and from our point of view, we just have to believe a good result and good performance is around the corner,” Clement said.\nAfter the interval United patiently searched for a second and soon found one when Lingard, unmarked, headed home from the edge of the box. Tuanzebe, the 19-year old who looked assured from start to finish (an excitable late challenge on Jordan Ayew aside), eased past two Swansea players before picking out Matteo Darmian, whose floated cross from the right was superbly guided home by Lingard running at full tilt.\nClement summoned top-scorer Tammy Abraham, who instantly forced Romero into a save, but the reliance on the Chelsea loanee to always find a spark must be of concern.\nMourinho introduced Lukaku and Nemanja Matic, by which point United were in cruise control. “We’re the famous Man United, and we’re going to Wembley,” sang the jubilant travelling supporters.\n"

        "text": "\nThey gave everything to see it out. They were quick to the ball, strong in the challenge and utterly determined not to let the game have a dramatic, late twist. And, finally, Huddersfield Town, the team whose glories all belonged to another era, could soak up the euphoria of a win against Manchester United, their first since March 1952, and one of those joyous occasions when football reminds you of its ability to conjure up a rare kind of excitement.\nThe last time Huddersfield beat a team from Old Trafford, Manchester, came just a few weeks after Elizabeth II was pronounced Queen, in the same year that London was covered in its worst smog and some bright spark at the New Musical Express had the idea of printing the first-ever Top 40. Huddersfield were relegated that season and United won the league, Sir Matt Busby’s first title, despite a 3-2 defeat at Leeds Road. On this evidence, do not be too sure it will be the same again this season for either club.\nJosé Mourinho made the same point when he seemed horrified that any side with title ambitions could be so feeble. His team, he said, had lost because one set of players had the correct attitude, and the other side did not, and it was noticeable that he took care not to make a scapegoat of Victor Lindelof on a harrowing day for the club’s £31m summer recruit.\nThe point he was making was that it was a collective failure – “I don’t even remember a friendly match where our attitude was so poor,” was one line – and for a team with United’s aspirations, with Manchester City powering on at the top of the league, it was a calamitous result.\n\n\n \n\n\nPlay Video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n0:38\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Mourinho questions Manchester United attitude after loss to Huddersfield – video\n\n\nThe damage was inflicted in a five-minute spell in the first half when Aaron Mooy and Laurent Depoitre punished some atrocious defending. Marcus Rashford’s header, after 78 minutes, set up a nerve-shredding finale. Even then, there were only sporadic moments when it seemed as though an equaliser would follow. No team, Sir Alex Ferguson used to say, scored more late than goals than his own. The modern-day side does not have that yet. Not here anyway.\nThe most startling part, however, was that United had kept seven clean sheets in their previous eight league fixtures and had arrived in west Yorkshire knowing that if they could manage one more it would be the first time a top-division side had started a season that way.\nInstead, it probably was not a coincidence that they disintegrated at the back once Phil Jones went off with an injury and within 10 minutes of Lindelof’s introduction they had conceded as many league goals as the previous two months. Jones has rarely seemed so important and here was the evidence why Mourinho has been so reluctant to use Lindelof during the early parts of the season.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Phil Jones punches the floor in frustration after suffering an injury which turned out to be pivotal in the game. Photograph: Andrew Yates/Reuters\n\n\nThe damage to his confidence will be considerable but this was a traumatic day for Juan Mata as well bearing in mind it was his mistake that led to the opening goal. Until that point David de Gea had scarcely been threatened but United were vulnerable as soon as Mooy dispossessed Mata. Huddersfield suddenly had a three-versus-two breakaway and when Mooy slipped the ball to his left Tom Ince turned Lindelof inside out. Ince’s shot came back off De Gea and the ball fell invitingly for Mooy to sweep in the rebound.\n\n\n\n\nChelsea’s César Azpilicueta makes Watford pay for misses in thriller\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Lindelof, the game was becoming an ordeal. Five minutes later, Jonas Lossl aimed a long goal-kick into United’s half and the substitute had what should have been a routine header. It was a blowy afternoon, but there was no real mitigation for the way he misjudged the flight of the ball. Depoitre could hardly believe his luck, taking the ball around De Gea and slotting his shot into an exposed goal.\nThe most impressive part of Huddersfield’s performance was that they never allowed anxiety to creep in. They refused to let United settle and for long spells it was remarkable how comfortable they looked.\nRashford’s goal, a far-post header from Romelu Lukaku’s cross, did change the complexion and the home side also had to contend with four minutes of stoppage-time. Those were the moments, however, when Huddersfield’s players showed a spirit of togetherness that will be crucial in the coming months.\nMooy was the game’s outstanding performer but there were half a dozen of his team-mates, most notably Ince and Christopher Schindler, who pushed him close, whereas it was difficult to think of a single player in red who wore the colours with distinction. Rashford, one of two half-time substitutes, did at least bring something new, but that was about it. Nemanja Matic had his worst game for United by some distance and Anthony Martial, like Mata, was removed at the interval.\nMartial had been the only player on the pitch, barring the two goalkeepers, who felt the occasion warranted a pair of gloves and he melted out of the game after an early tête-à-tête with Tommy Smith, the home team’s right-back. Smith was excellent and somehow that told the story of this game.\n\n\n\n\nManchester City’s Sergio Agüero equals scoring mark in win against Burnley\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

But when you lose because of attitude, that is really bad. I heard Ander Herrera in his flash [television] interview saying the attitude and desire was poor. Oh my God, when a player says that, or a player feels that, I think they should all go to the press conference and explain why – because I cannot explain that. It concerns me because if it happened today why can’t it happen tomorrow?”\nA dismal afternoon for United was compounded by the first-half injury that forced off Phil Jones shortly before Aaron Mooy and Laurent Depoitre scored within five minutes of one another to give Huddersfield a 2-0 lead. Victor Lindelof, Jones’s replacement, had a torrid game, badly at fault for the second goal, but Mourinho’s anger was directed towards the entire team on a day when Juan Mata and Anthony Martial were both substituted at half-time.\n“The mistakes – him [Lindelof] for the second goal and Mata for the first goal – are mistakes that belong in the context. If you play an amazing game and lose to an individual mistake, yes, you point the finger. But that was not the case here. In the first half I was waiting for it. It was Mata and Victor but it could have been another player because the attitude was really poor.\n“I feel really disappointed and if I was a Manchester United supporter – not a manager but a traditional supporter – I would be really disappointed. You can play and lose a football match because the opponent had more quality than you. But you cannot lose because the opponent had a better attitude than you, so I am really disappointed.\n“They [Huddersfield] played how I like. They played with everything they have, how I like, and like it has to be. They played with everything: aggression, desire, motivation, sacrifice. They played with everything and we didn’t. So the team that deserved to win won – simple.”\nMarcus Rashford’s 78th-minute goal set up a tense finish but Huddersfield’s manager, David Wagner, agreed with Mourinho that it was a deserved victory, describing it as “one of the top three moments I have had, personally, as manager of this club”.\nWagner added: “This is a very proud moment. We all know how huge it is that we have beaten Man United. We have to make totally clear so everyone understands what is extraordinary and what is ordinary. Today was extraordinary. I live in Huddersfield so I know how huge this is for this town, the supporters, the chairman, the board. This is a very special moment.”\n"

Mourinho and Özil worked well together, with the Portuguese placing great trust in the playmaker as he quickly realised that Özil was capable of understanding and executing complex tactical orders.”\n\n\n\n\nHarry Winks earns England call-up after Fabian Delph and Phil Jones withdraw\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd there may be even more change coming for Arsenal in January, with the Star suggesting that the Gunners “could swap Alexis Sánchez for Paris Saint-Germain star Julian Draxler in a mega January transfer deal”. Apparently the French club is “tempted by the idea” but face competition for the Chilean from Milan, among others.\nAnd then there’s Antoine Griezmann, the French forward who signed a new contract with Atlético Madrid but a few months ago after a long-rumoured move to Manchester United failed to actually happen. Now Alexandre Lacazette has given an interview in which he declares he and Griezmann “are very good friends and have lots of fun”, principally by calling each other by their ingenious pet names, Griezzy and Lacaz. “If Griezzy visits me in London,” Lacazette pledges, “I’m going to ask him to sign for Arsenal!” This light-hearted comment, made by someone who has no influence whatsoever over Arsenal’s transfer dealings, has prompted actual news stories in apparently serious publications.\nRonald Koeman may have been given a stay of execution by Everton’s major shareholder, Farhad Moshiri, but according to the Sun he’s not happy about it. Apparently his players “are convinced [their manager] wants out of Goodison Park” having “noticed the Dutchman becoming more distant and detached” and now “believe he is just waiting to be fired”.\nAcross town at Anfield, meanwhile, Liverpool are preparing to make a signing. Could this be the actually-decent centre-half they so desperately need? Nope, it’s Sheffield United’s 20-year-old winger David Brooks, who has only made 20 first-team appearances in his life but since breaking into the first-team at the start of the season has, we’re told, impressed scouts so regularly that the Reds are ready to get their chequebook out.\nElsewhere in the Championship, there is a veritable scrum taking place as scouts compete for the best view of the Middlesbrough defender Dael Fry, who according to the Mail “has impressed at the heart of Boro’s defence this season” even if “he was taken out of the firing line last weekend after a blip against Norwich”. Still, it has been enough to get Manchester United, Everton, Leicester and Chelsea excited. United meanwhile have had some bad news in their pursuit of another talented youngster, Sarpsborg’s Senegalese starlet Krépin Diatta, whose agent has admitted that “he’s not ready for a big European club” and insisted that “you need to go through the steps methodically”. \n"

However, the more notable substitution was the arrival of Victor Lindelof, a centre-half, in place of Ashley Young, who was playing as a winger, in stoppage time.\n“You could not play this way at Liverpool but it’s OK for Manchester United,” Klopp said. “I thought we were worthy of three points. There were a lot of good individual performances. But when an opponent has this kind of defensive approach you will not create 20 chances.”\n"

        "text": "\nToday’s big news is that the Mirror has cracked the mystery surrounding José Mourinho’s presence at Serbia’s World Cup qualifier against Austria. Surely he wouldn’t have gone all that way just to keep an eye on Nemanja Matic, who he can keep a perfectly good eye on most of the time without so much as leaving Manchester? No he was not: he was checking out Matic’s team-mate Mijat Gacinovic, the 22-year-old Eintracht Frankfurt midfielder, who the paper reports, “has been identified as one of the most exciting young talents currently operating in the Bundesliga”. Bayern Munich also had a representative at the game, and Arsenal had a scout at Serbia’s two previous internationals, so if Manchester United want to actually sign him they should be ready to rumble. Brighton also had scouts at the match, though they aren’t likely to compete for Gacinovic – they’re interested in the Newcastle outcast Aleksandar Mitrovic, with whose constant disciplinary tightrope-walking Rafael Benítez has finally lost patience.\n\n\n\n\nTottenham striker Harry Kane included on 2017 Ballon d’Or shortlist\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManchester City want to sign yet another full-back, says the Sun, to help them cope with Benjamin Mendy’s absence through injury. Never mind that Mendy is expected to be back in four months and the transfer window opens in three, meaning the new signing would become essentially redundant within weeks of his arrival. Anyway, they fancy Napoli’s Faouzi Ghoulam, who is out of contract next summer and could thus, they speculate, be snapped up for a paltry £3m. Conveniently, “City are hoping to open talks with Napoli next week when they face each other in the Champions League”.\nParis Saint-Germain want to buy a goalkeeper next summer and have drawn up a shortlist of potential recruits. A very short list. There are just two names upon it, reports le10sport.com, and they are Atlético Madrid’s Jan Oblak and Manchester United’s David de Gea. The French club believes either could be purchased next year without breaking financial fair play rules, so long as someone takes Javier Pastore and Ángel Di María off their hands. Di María could move to China as early as January, apparently.\nTalking of PSG players, Real Madrid have located “the new Kylian Mbappé”, reports Don Balón, and they are not going to let this one slip through their fingers like they did the last. This one is Dimitri Oberlin, currently on loan at Basel from Red Bull Salzburg (confusingly, the new Kylian Mbappé is some 14 months older than the old Kylian Mbappé). “The young pearl of European football scored two of his side’s five goals against Benfica in their last Champions League game,” Don Balón reports. “Of course, several of the biggest clubs in Europe are already monitoring him. But Florentino Pérez hopes to be the first to move.”\nThe Lazio centre-back Stefan de Vrij appears to be attempting a BorisJohnsonesque have-your-cake-and-eat-it-too-style negotiation with the Italian club. Lazio want to bind him to a new contract, and have offered a healthy pay rise which the defender is minded to accept. However, they also want to set the player’s release clause to something in the off-putting neighbourhood of £40m, but he wants it to be just half that “as he would still be interested in joining a big club in the summer”, according to Calciomercato. Thus he hopes to end up with all the benefits of a bumper new contract, with all the advantages of a miserly old one, the cunning old dog. This news is particularly pertinent to Liverpool, one of the big clubs – along with Juventus and Atlético Madrid – who have been linked with the 25-year-old. Across town at Everton, they are mulling over a move for the giant Sporting Lisbon striker Bas Dost. “Ronald Koeman is determined to sign a forward when the transfer window opens in January and has held a long-term interest in his fellow Dutchman,” reports ESPN.\nFinally, the Italian FA is hoping to convince Antonio Conte to abandon Chelsea and return to the helm of his national team next summer, the Express exclusively reports. “Express Sport understands influential figures within the FIGC want Conte back in charge after Gian Pero Ventura failed to impress during their World Cup qualifying campaign,” it says. “Milan are also keen on Conte and are ready to make him an offer this summer, but Chelsea want the popular Italian to stay.”\n"

        "text": "\nJosé Mourinho believes the key to Manchester United beating CSKA Moscow in Wednesday’s Champions League game and maintaining their fine start to the season is to be dominant while staying humble and respecting the home side.\nUnited are unbeaten in eight matches this season, winning seven including Saturday’s 1-0 win at Southampton. In that outing they had to defend for prolonged passages having overrun all of their previous opponents apart from Stoke City, with whom they only drew 2-2.\nUnited won their Group A opener 3-0 against Basel at Old Trafford a fortnight ago and Mourinho is again targeting maximum points at the VEB Arena against Viktor Goncharenko’s side, who finished second in the Russian Premier League last season.\n\n\n\n\nChampions League Group B: CSKA Moscow 0-1 Manchester United\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“We cannot guarantee this line of success but the way to try to keep it going is to do what we’re doing,” Mourinho said. “We try to play well and in some moments of the match, if the opponents have moments of superiority, we have to be humble, like we were against Southampton, and to cope with the difficult moments.\n“Looking at the match at Southampton on TV, I think there was an episode in the first half that could transform the game [Shane Long’s first-half challenge on Marouane Fellaini which resulted in an ankle injury for the Belgian]. We were winning 1-0 when that happened and we could be in control and win the game easily, but in the second half we had to be humble and accept the opponent was on a high and we had to fight hard.\n“So I think it’s a mixture of our quality and trying to be dominant, like we want to be always, but accepting the reality of high-level football, that when the opponent has a strong moment, you have to cope with it.”\nFellaini completed the match although he was subsequently ruled out of the trip to Moscow and the hope is he will be available after next month’s international break and will only miss Crystal Palace’s visit to Old Trafford on Saturday.\nWith Paul Pogba and Michael Carrick also injured the manager has only two frontline midfielders available, Ander Herrera and Nemanja Matic.\nMourinho, who is also without Phil Jones and Antonio Valencia, said: “For me Craig Pawson is not one of the big guns of refereeing in England but he was so calm and so much in control [at Southampton]. After I watched it on television it became clear to me, but there was no camera for Craig so he made that decision.”\nMourinho hopes Fellaini will not now be called up by Belgium for their international matches as they have already qualified for the 2018 World Cup. “Fellaini was lucky – he could have been in a much worse situation but at the moment … when we don’t have Pogba and Carrick,” he added. “I expect him not to be out for a long time and after Crystal Palace – Belgium are the first country to qualify so I hope he can be playing for us.”\nMourinho has faced CSKA with three of his previous clubs and believes Goncharenko’s side are the strongest. “I played against CSKA with Real Madrid, with Inter, with Chelsea and now with Manchester United, so it’s something normal in my Champions League career,” he said. “Opponents wise, I think it’s the best CSKA that I’m going to play against. I think it’s the best team that I face with CSKA as an opponent.”\nHenrikh Mkhitaryan was among United’s best players when they won the Europa League last season. The attacking midfielder scored six times, one of them in the 2-0 final win over Ajax. Yet Mourinho wants the 28-year-old to elevate his game. “He played well in the Europa League but that was last season and we need him to perform again and the level is higher; the matches away from home are more difficult and we need the best from our players,” the manager said.\nAfter the Basel win Mourinho declared himself unhappy with the display after United had gone 2-0 up on 53 minutes and only added one more, comparing it to “PlayStation football”.\nMkhitaryan agreed. “Everyone knows that José Mourinho is very demanding and what he said is right,” the Armenian said. “He didn’t say exactly names, but everyone thinks he had done something bad or done some mistakes, but we’re trying to improve that aspect and be more focused during the whole game.”\n"

        "text": "\nManchester United have maximum points from their two Champions League outings and return home from Moscow in buoyant mood. From the first to last whistle they coasted to a win that means José Mourinho’s side have now scored 28 goals in nine outings this season.\nUnited owed this victory to the superb Anthony Martial, who created both of Romelu Lukaku’s goals, scored a penalty and generally terrorised CSKA Moscow whenever he took possession.\n\n\n\n\nAtlético Madrid v Chelsea: Champions League – live!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMourinho called this the “strongest” display from teams he has managed against CSKA, having done so with Chelsea, Internazionale and Real Madrid. “That was my best team. It is true,” Mourinho said. “I came here and faced very good teams but I think this was the strongest performance. Today we were really strong and it was my strongest performance here.”\nMourinho had made five changes from the 1-0 win at Southampton on Saturday. Marouane Fellaini, Phil Jones and Antonio Valencia did not travel because of injury and Marcus Rashford and Juan Mata were dropped to the bench. In came Chris Smalling and Victor Lindelof to a three‑man defence. Mourinho also drafted in Daley Blind as left wing-back, Ander Herrera into midfield, and Martial to attack.\nUnited’s opening goal arrived on four minutes and was started and finished by Lukaku. The No9 spun a pass out to the left that was perfectly weighted into Martial’s path. The Frenchman cut inside and dropped the ball on to the head of Lukaku, who beat Igor Akinfeev to his left from a few yards out.\nDavid de Gea ensured the lead was not conceded within a few seconds. CSKA attacked and an Aleksandr Golovin miskick became a pass that rolled to Alan Dzagoev. The No10 pulled the trigger but De Gea dived to his right to steer the ball out for a corner. CSKA gained nothing from this and soon United were 2-0 up. Henrikh Mkhitaryan was upended by Georgi Schennikov in the area and Jonas Eriksson pointed to the spot. The referee was booed and so was Martial but the Frenchman coolly rolled the ball to Akinfeev’s left as he dived right.\nThe home crowd continued to roar their team on though they were quietened by United’s third. Again, CSKA succumbed to the Martial-Lukaku combination. The No11 bounced a cross in, Vasili Berezutski air-kicked and there was Lukaku for a 14th goal in 11 appearances this season, his 10th in nine for United. He was close to a first United hat-trick when later taking aim from 25 yards, Akinfeev scrambling to his left to beat the ball out.\nOf Lukaku, Mourinho said: “It is a great achievement but it is only possible with a good team. Without a good team it is not possible and the team is playing well. They are amazing numbers for Romelu. He is humble and wants to learn and improve all the time. I think ambition is there and I don’t think he is going to be very impressed with your great words because I think he knows when things aren’t going well your [media] words are also strong in a negative way. I trust he can keep performing for us.”\nDe Gea’s class is such that when called upon after United’s flurry of goals he could still react expertly to keep out a Fedor Chalov effort and at the interval it remained 3-0, with the contest surely over. CSKA’s sole hope appeared to be to try to get one back early in the second half and see where this might take them.\nThey swept forward in a move that ended with Golovin firing over De Gea’s bar from outside United’s area. Yet this was a brief respite as the Martial‑Lukaku axis came close to breaching CSKA once more when some razor‑sharp play ended with the former snapping a pass to the latter right in front of Akinfeev and the Belgian should have hit the net rather than the goalkeeper.\nNext up Ashley Young, the right wing-back and United’s captain for the night, swung a rare cross in from his side and Blind rose, though he failed to direct his header. When Mkhitaryan smashed home United’s fourth after Martial’s attempt was repelled by Akinfeev the match became the proverbial stroll for United.\nThis proved the Armenian’s last act as Jesse Lingard replaced him. From here United toyed with Russia’s second-placed side of last year, though Konstantin Kuchaev scored with a low shot from a narrow angle near the close.\n"

        "text": "\nNobody is such a master of the humdrum four-goal win as José Mourinho. When his sides start winning 4-0 and 4-1 and others start rolling their eyes, it is a sure sign that things are going well. In claiming the league title in 2004-05, his Chelsea side scored four goals in a game seven times. The victory against Everton on Sunday was the third time already this season that Manchester United have won a league game 4-0.\nIt is the perfect Mourinho score, a brusque assertion of superiority rather than an artefact or a drama to be stored in the game’s collective memory for ever.\n\n\n\n\nJosé Mourinho says ‘happiness’ is key to Anthony Martial’s upturn in form\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is, of course, early days. Everton should have been United’s first real test but their start to the season has been so poor that it is still impossible to know how Mourinho’s side will fare against the serious challengers. Not until they play Liverpool at Anfield on 14 October will there be any real gauge of how good this United team are – and arguably then only if Jürgen Klopp gets his defence sorted.\nBut what is already true is that United are not struggling to dispatch smaller sides as they did last season, when they were crippled by 15 draws, 10 of them at home. There is a remorselessness and a ruthlessness this term, an energy and a physical power. They are the tallest team in any of Europe’s top five leagues.\nThat nine of their 16 league goals have come in the final 10 minutes of games both suggests their stamina and accentuates the psychological dimension for opponents. It is no good holding out against them for half an hour or an hour and hoping they get frustrated. Fall behind and come out against them and they will counter you into oblivion. They are relentless, pitiless, inexhaustible, a football boot stamping on the face of the rest of the league, or at least its smaller members.\nRomelu Lukaku already looks a wise investment. He has scored five goals and registered an assist this season, as well as winning 3.2 of 7.8 aerial duels contested per 90 minutes (which is roughly comparable to Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s record of winning 3.1 of every 6.2 contested last season). There are still those who question his movement – Ian Wright was the latest former striker to express scepticism – and it may be that in tighter games that does become a significant issue, less for what it does to his capacity to score goals than for what it means for the structure of the team as a whole, but it may also be that he is less of a fixed point in those games.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  The scoreboard at Old Trafford displays a familiar scoreline. Photograph: Rex Shutterstock\n\n\nFor now, all that is certain is that Lukaku has given United a punch against weaker teams that they lacked last season. Mourinho, as he so often does in his second season, has found solutions to the problems identified in the first.\nOne issue that many identified as a problem last season, though, has not changed. Last season, no side in the Premier League ran less than Manchester United, which was generally interpreted as a reflection of their occasional sluggishness and perhaps especially the lack of mobility of Ibrahimovic. Yet this season they are averaging as a team 0.6km per game less than last season, more than only Swansea and West Ham, and there is no suggestion they are labouring.\nGiven how meticulous Mourinho is, given how consistently he has made improvements between his first and second seasons at a club, the only conclusion can be that he never regarded that as an issue – and results so far would seem to back him up. High distance run stats can indicate one of two things: either a side who play a hard pressing game (which is why Tottenham are second in the list) or a team who have spent a lot of time chasing after the ball (which is why Bournemouth are top and averaging more than 20km per game more this season than last).\n\n\n\n\nAntonio Valencia screamer sets up Manchester United win over Everton\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMourinho’s sides, though, are discerning in when they press. They tend to sit deep, even against lesser sides, far deeper than is fashionable. His teams have always been at their best when they have space in front of them, which is why pace in forward areas and drive from midfield are so important to him. There has been criticism from those who played for him both at Real Madrid and in his second spell at Chelsea for a lack of coordinated attacking practice, particularly against massed defences and that, perhaps, is his one tactical weakness. He seems to prefer, counterintuitively for such a controlling figure, to sort out the defence and then allow his forwards to improvise – which is perhaps why his greatest successes have come with those clubs who could portray themselves as outsiders.\nBut this season only Stoke have resisted them. There will be sterner tests ahead, but if United are cuffing aside non-challengers, then they do not have to attack those clubs who are challengers. They can sit back, kill the game, take the draw if necessary and hope their counterattacking prowess pinches a win. That is why the best Mourinho sides have been frontrunners: get ahead, make the opposition attack and use that against them. The 4-0s may feel unremarkable but they are symptomatic of a team in very good health.\n"

Mourinho has claimed the trophy four times as a manager – including his first silverware with United last season – and is the only one of the current 92 league managers to win it.\nYet of a competition that dates from the 1960-61 season, he said: “Could the English football survive or even be better without this competition? Maybe, maybe we would be fresher for European competition for example. But we have this competition, we have to respect the sponsors, we have to respect the opponents and a lot of us are trying to do our best.\n“If the competition is an official competition then it is important for Manchester United and for me as a manager.”\n\n\n\n\nHolders Manchester United handed trip to Swansea in Carabao Cup draw\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnited knocked out Burton in what is becoming familiar fashion this season. This fourth four-goal haul made it a total of 24 in eight outings in all competitions. Marcus Rashford scored twice and terrorised Burton to be the night’s best performer, while Mourinho also praised his other forwards. “[Anthony] Martial was good, [Jesse] Lingard was good, everybody in attacking areas gave dynamic in the team. We look happy playing this moment,” he said.\nInside five minutes United took the lead with a simple goal for Rashford. Michael Carrick floated the ball over and found the No19 via Lingard inside Burton’s area to make it 1-0. It was precisely the start Mourinho would have wanted and Nigel Clough, the Burton manager, would have dreaded.\nUnited’s second came when Daley Blind pushed the ball down the left and Rashford gave Connor Ripley no chance with a fierce shot that beat the Burton goalkeeper off his right post.\nIt was Rashford’s fifth goal in five United appearances and he was near-unplayable whenever a red shirt found him. Ander Herrera zipped a pass down the right, Rashford beat the offside trap and only a flailing boot from Ben Turner prevented him from taking aim again.\nUnited were slicker and more determined, Juan Mata spurning a chance and Martial being denied by Ripley’s legs. When the Brewers managed an attack, Joe Mason’s chip was saved by Sergio Romero. Next in a seemingly endless medley of chances, Mata hit Ripley’s left post, Matteo Darmian collected the loose ball and found Martial, but his volley ricocheted away.\nIf this was largely United’s second string, Mourinho would be pleased with their pace and how keen the deputies were to impress. The third goal derived from some dazzling Martial skill as he produced a trick near Burton’s penalty area and tapped the ball to Lingard, whose shot took a heavy deflection, giving Ripley no chance.\nOf what might be viewed Mourinho’s strongest XI, only Mata and Rashford were included, the manager making nine changes from the side that beat Everton 4-0 here on Sunday. This was the same number as Clough made for Burton, as Turner and Jamie Allen survived from Saturday’s 2-1 win against Fulham.\nFor the second half Luke Shaw was introduced for Mata, the left-back making a first appearance since 30 April because of an ankle ligament injury. Clough brought on Stephen Warnock and Luke Murphy for Allen and Turner.\n\n\n\n\nMichy Batshuayi hits treble and Charly Musonda excels as Chelsea silence Forest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShaw’s first notable action was to put the ball in the net, albeit from an offside position, and next he was sharp at the other end when recovering after losing the ball near Romero. He later linked with Lingard down the left as United kept possession with ease.\nAs the hour approached Mourinho was moved to applause by a twinkle-toed dance through Burton’s defence by Martial that would have produced a fine goal if not for Ripley’s save. Moments later, however, he did beat the goalkeeper with a cool finish, then Rashford’s value to Mourinho was illustrated by his being taken off as the contest entered its final third.\nWith virtually the final touch of the game, Lloyd Dyer scored a consolation for Burton, the first goal against United at Old Trafford this season. But they had cantered home and a professional display left Mourinho in relaxed form. “I learned nothing new, just what I know, they all want to play, are ready to play,” he said. “I think they enjoy the game because these League Cup matches, I think it’s essential.”\nUnited next travel to Swansea City in the fourth round.\n"

He had heard his name sung and, before he disappeared into the tunnel, there was a little, polite wave of appreciation. Yet Rooney wore the look of a man whose return to Old Trafford had felt like an ordeal and he can never have imagined there would come a time when he would find himself in the away dressing room ruminating on what it is like to be in the relegation zone.\nThe paradox is that this was not always the fluent, dangerous Manchester United that has been seen in other parts in the new season and it felt slightly perplexing that José Mourinho described it as their best performance so far.

It is the first time United have won their opening three home games since the 2011-12 season and they are level with Manchester City at the top of the Premier League on identical records: 13 points, 15 goals scored, two conceded. Pep Guardiola’s team are top solely because their second name starts with a C rather than a U.\nEverton, in stark contrast, find themselves in the bottom three on the back of that late flurry of goals when Henrikh Mkhitaryan (83 minutes), Romelu Lukaku (89) and the substitute Anthony Martial (92) quadrupled the score and Rooney, chin in hands, watched forlornly from the dugout, having just been substituted.\nAntonio Valencia had opened the scoring, four minutes in, with a firecracker of a shot and these feel like difficult moments for Ronald Koeman and his players. Everton have now gone six games in all competitions without a victory, losing the last four with a combined score of 0-12, and have not won in the league since the opening weekend of the season. “Please be realistic,” Koeman said afterwards, taking issue with Mourinho’s reference to Everton being a club that had ambitions of a top-four finish. The reality, however, is that Everton’s supporters were entitled to expect more after an extensive period of summer recruitment.\nA lot of those fans had already left by the time Martial’s penalty, after a Morgan Schneiderlin handball, completed the scoring. They enjoyed that moment in the first half when Lukaku shot wide when it seemed certain he would score. Yet they also had to endure being shushed by their former striker after he had set up Mkhitaryan’s goal. Lukaku had been booed by the away end and, when he added the third goal, he made a beeline towards the Evertonians, cupping his ear as if to ask why the volume had suddenly gone down.\nAs for Rooney, he found it difficult early on to provide any evidence that he can still flourish at United’s level. He did, however, grow into the game and became a difficult opponent for Eric Bailly in particular. It needed David de Gea’s quick reactions to deny Rooney an equaliser early in the second half and it was something of a surprise that Koeman removed him in the 81st minute. At the risk of sounding slightly cruel it was a better performance than the crowd here became used to seeing from Rooney in recent seasons. Throughout the middle hour of the game there was not actually a great deal between the two teams. Yet Valencia’s goal was a beauty and it is difficult to think of any other time in his eight years at Old Trafford when he has struck a shot more powerfully. United’s captain was 20 yards from goal, aiming diagonally from close to the far corner of the penalty area, when Nemanja Matic’s crossfield pass curled his way and he let fly.\nThe noise of the crowd made it clear they had witnessed something special and the ball flashed past Jordan Pickford at the kind of speed that makes it harsh, perhaps, to question the goalkeeper. Even so, an argument could be made that the shot was central enough to be saved. Hypothetical, perhaps, but it is difficult to think De Gea would have been beaten that way.\nEven in a four-goal win De Gea showed again why he is so valuable with second-half saves from Rooney and Gylfi Sigurdsson. An equaliser would not have been implausible at that stage but it was still more likely that the home team would score next.\nMkhitaryan swept a low shot past Pickford to soothe the crowd’s nerves and Lukaku’s seventh goal in seven games for his new club came from close range in a crowded penalty area. Lukaku’s free-kick had bounced back off the defensive wall but Matic fired the loose ball back in and United’s £75m striker had dashed forward, anticipating the ball might come back his way. How Everton miss him.\n"

        "text": "\nManchester United have made a bid to sign Alexis Sánchez from Arsenal as José Mourinho attempts to scupper Manchester City’s hopes of securing the Chile forward this month.\nSánchez has already agreed personal terms worth around £250,000 a week with Pep Guardiola’s side, with City having submitted a £20m offer for the 29‑year‑old this week. Arsenal have yet to respond to that but it is understood United have since entered the race with a bid in the region of £25m.\n\n\n\n\nTransfer window January 2018 – every deal in Europe's top five leagues\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheir proposal would also lead to Sánchez earning more than offered by City, with Mourinho believed to be confident of winning the race despite the forward having played under Guardiola at Barcelona.\nUnited have offered Arsenal the opportunity to sign Henrikh Mkhitaryan, although a stumbling block to that deal could be the Armenian international’s wages, which are believed to be around £200,000 a week.\nSánchez’s representatives have already held talks with City having agreed to join them last summer, only for the deal to collapse when Arsenal failed to sign Thomas Lemar as a replacement on deadline day. He remains a target for Arsène Wenger, although the Frenchman is also keen on signing Malcom from Bordeaux and held preliminary talks with his agent this week. The Brazilian forward is understood to have another firm proposal to leave this month, although not from United or Tottenham, who have both been linked with the 20-year-old in recent weeks.\nBordeaux are demanding a fee of €50m (£44.5m) and would prefer to retain Malcom until the end of the season. The situation is complicated by his ownership status, with the French club reported to own only 50% of his economic rights and the remainder held by a number of agents.\nMeanwhile, United’s hopes of signing Ryan Sessegnon this month have been dealt a blow after Fulham’s head of football operations insisted the 17-year-old would not be leaving Craven Cottage in January. Sessegnon, who finished as joint-top scorer at the European Under-19 Championship in June with three goals, has been tracked by United’s scouts for some time and has also attracted interest from Tottenham and Real Madrid. The European champions have watched the defender on several occasions this season and are understood to be monitoring his situation, while Spurs had a bid potentially worth more than £20m with add-ons rejected in the summer.\nUnited had been prepared to offer an initial £25m to secure him this month but Fulham’s Tony Khan, who is the son of the club’s owner Shahid Khan, said Sessegnon has agreed to remain at Craven Cottage until the end of the season.\n“As it’s been the subject of a great deal of speculation, I’d like to announce that Ryan Sessegnon is staying with Fulham and will not be departing during this January transfer window,” Khan told the Telegraph. “Ryan is a very important part of the Fulham family, and we’re grateful that he’ll be with us as we fight to achieve promotion this season.”\n"

Guys, these are compliments! Your lot are never satisfied, are they?\nAnd so to some Manchester United fans’ chants about their striker Romelu Lukaku, which a totally encouraging number of people simply cannot see are racist. To be super-clear (and apologies to those who realised this in 1964 or whenever): any assumption about someone made solely on the basis of that person’s race is racist. It may also be banter – but it is racist banter. And if anyone’s still struggling with the logical underpinnings of that incredibly simple rule of thumb, we’ll be diving deeper into why in a minute.\n\n\n\n\nDavid Squires on … Harry Redknapp and football managers' early-season troubles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor now, Kick It Out has written to Manchester United asking them to act on the Lukaku chants, explaining: “Racist stereotypes are never acceptable in football or wider society, irrespective of showing support for a player.” In 2014, a YouGov analysis of Manchester United and Manchester City fans asked the two groups to describe themselves from a list of over 200 personality traits. With United fans, the one that came out top was “adaptable”. So do let’s hope they’ll swiftly adapt to not singing songs about Lukaku’s cock size.\nHang on – before we continue, I should stress: not all Manchester United fans. An unquantified minority of Manchester United fans. A minority who have almost without doubt completely lost their shit in the past if anyone tried to stereotype them in some way. As troublemakers, say, or people who live in Surrey. Yes, it’s a particular irony that those voicing distaste about the Lukaku chant are now being accused of oversensitivity by a certain strand of quick-to-temper football fans, who absolutely cannot stand to be generalised about themselves in any way. I mean, they really wet their pants about it.\nIf it relates to their own tribe, there are few more sensitive and chippy policers of language than some football fans. Fire up the internet and start anything other than the most positive sentence with the words “All fans of X club are” and you would be accused of appalling bias, hatred of the club, laziness, and a variety of unprintables besides. It is absolutely right that phrases like “a section of fans” and “a minority of fans” appear in news reports relating to the less savoury incidents that occasionally attend the game. But I sometimes feel they need to feature in special highlighted type in case arguably the most oversensitive group in society thinks someone’s accusing them, personally, of whatever it is. Not all United fans. Not all Chelsea fans. Not all England fans. Not all men.\n\n\n\n\n \n\nWhat’s the likelihood the only stereotype those people hold about black people is that they have enormous penises? Zero\n\n\nBut back to Lukaku and this one-eyed notion that stereotyping someone in a manner perceived to be complimentary is somehow problem-free. As huge amounts of psychological research have found, the trouble with supposedly positive stereotypes is that they tend to be accompanied in the minds of those who hold them by distinctly less complimentary ones. Time and again research papers have showed you couldn’t have one without the other: people who saw Asians as great at maths also thought they were cold and remote, and terrible drivers. If we may boil down this tendency to a racist drama in three sentences: why is it racist to say Jews are careful with their money? It’s a compliment, for God’s sake. Bloody hell, trust the Jews to find something to complain about.\nAnd so with the Lukaku chant. I’m afraid we have to ask ourselves something about those Manchester United fans chanting their great big compliment at Lukaku: what’s the likelihood the only stereotype those people hold about black people is that they have enormous penises? Honestly, what are the chances? Zero, is the answer to that, whether or not they even realise it.\nAs the aforementioned social psychologists repeatedly find, those who are positively stereotyped in one department are negatively stereotyped in others. For instance, you don’t get people to assume you have a superior penis without them also quietly assuming you have an inferior brain.\nThis is why it is so unreasonable to expect people to laugh along with what may seem to those indulging in it to be “just banter” – be they the subject of the chant himself, or other black people who hear it or hear of it. Not all of them may declare they have a problem with it but the ones who do have a very real and serious problem with it. Why should they be expected to laugh gratefully as you tell them they have a huge penis, when inside they may be well aware you also probably think they’re lazy and more predisposed to criminal behaviour?\n\n\n\n\nRio Ferdinand confirms move into boxing: 'It’s a challenge I’m not taking lightly'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObviously, this questionably complimentary stereotyping isn’t restricted to race. It may come as a shock to the system for men given to paying a certain type of compliment but when women heard men praise them for conforming to one positive stereotype – being ladylike, for instance, or nurturing – they stated they were more likely to think the man also held negative stereotypes about them. And why wouldn’t he? He’s a stereotyper. Stands to reason he does it both ways. He may not be saying them out loud but they’re there.\nJust as they are with Lukaku. Prejudice masquerading as praise may appear superficially more appealing than prejudice without disguise. But only superficially.\n"

So Antonio Conte’s summer of strops and sulks looks set to yield a happy conclusion for the Italian, and also for N’Golo Kanté, who is poised to be reunited with not one but two old Leicester City chums, Danny Drinkwater and Riyad Mahrez.\nThere could be a snag in the Mahrez deal, however: because there are murmurs that José Mourinho wants to hijack it and bring the Algerian to Manchester United. What is more, there’s talk that Liverpool want to muscle in on Chelsea’s plans to sign Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, and that Oxlade-Chamberlain wouldn’t mind if they did. So rage on a little longer, Antonio, rage on.\n\n\n\n\nArsenal rebuff Manchester City’s £50m cash offer for Alexis Sánchez\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSomeone is going to feel the wrath of Leicester, too. West Brom, for starters, because the loss of Drinkwater has persuaded the Foxes to spoil the Baggies’ big coup and snaffle PSG’s Grzegorz Krychowiak instead. And Crystal Palace can also expect clog: because Leicester are going after their main defensive target, Liverpool’s Mamadou Sakho.\nBut Leicester may not be too bothered about keeping Islam Slimani, although Marseille will have to raise their offer to get him. And Leicester certainly aren’t bothered about keeping Nampalys Mendy. The midfielder has turned down a chance to return to France with Rennes but, on the other hand, is open to the possibility of heading back to Nice. Rennes may land another of their targets, however, as West Ham may let Diafra Sakho go.\nNoises from Liverpool suggest the club may finally agree to sell Philippe Coutinho to Barcelona for around £140m. That’s some quality haggling and no mistake. And it’ll make for a dandy summer if Liverpool manage to round things off by spending that windfall on Thomas Lemar and Virgil Van Dijk, which they hope to do.\nMeanwhile, Serge Aurier is hopeful that his move to Tottenham will be waved through on Wednesday. The PSG full-back has agreed terms with the club but is awaiting approval of his work permit and hopes the legal snafu he had a few years back won’t be held against him. The wait is beginning to irritate him. So now he knows how PSG felt against Lorient last season when, after Thomas Meunier had to depart injured, it took Aurier eight minutes to get dressed and come on as a substitute, with the application of socks proving particularly troublesome for the grown man.\n\n\n\n\nNewcastle’s Rafael Benítez willing to sell Dwight Gayle for £18m\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe former Liverpool manager Roy Hodgson would like to be known henceforth as the future manager of Crystal Palace. Hodgson knows a lame duck gaffer when he smells one and there’s no denying that Frank De Boer is giving off a strong anatine whiff right now. If it’s the Ajax way that Palace want, then Hodgson can do that no problem. Or how about a bit of Brazil 1970? Dukla Prague 1964? Hodgson is happy to take requests and 100% satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back*.\nElsewhere, it turns out that Monaco are not going to break the bank to relieve Stoke City of Gianelli Imbula. They’re not even going to take him on loan. But Toulouse are keen for some reason. Stoke, meanwhile, are also willing to listen to offers for Bojan Krkic.\nMiddlesbrough’s supremely gifted but seemingly useless player Adama Traoré has been linked with a move to Lille, where Marcelo Bielsa will either drill some tactical discipline into him or storm out in exasperation.\n* You must be joking\n"

        "text": "\nMarcus Rashford had been in the contest only two minutes when he sparked Manchester United’s third successive league victory.\nOn as a 68th-minute substitute, the 19-year-old initially won a corner when his cross was deflected out. Then from Henrikh Mkhitaryan’s delivery Rashford hit an instant finish beyond the Leicester City goalkeeper, Kasper Schmeichel, for his first goal of the season.\nThis followed Romelu Lukaku’s saved penalty just after the break and when fellow substitute Marouane Fellaini doubled the advantage eight minutes from time, United were heading for a two-point lead over Huddersfield Town and Manchester City at the top of the table.\n\n\n\n\nManchester United 2-0 Leicester City: Premier League – as it happened\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe performance had José Mourinho purring about his side’s resilience. “Normally when you miss a penalty with half an hour to go there is a little collapse,” the manager said. “We kept playing today.”\nDespite having started the campaign with two 4-0 wins, Mourinho indicated that each player has to perform to retain their place as he dropped Rashford for Anthony Martial. With Craig Shakespeare opting for the same XI that beat Brighton & Hove Albion 2-0 last Saturday and lost 4-3 at Arsenal the week before that, both sides could be viewed as settled.\nWhat Leicester hoped to do was stymie any early United pressure, having conceded here in the 22nd minute in last season’s corresponding fixture. Mourinho’s team went on to win that game 4-1 and here began by hitting Schmeichel’s area with crosses from Martial and Antonio Valencia. The response was a 20-yard Matty James sighter that David de Gea watched roll wide.\nOf note during the early exchanges was Martial’s willingness to rove infield to take the ball and drive at the visitors. United were superior in possession, taking residence in Leicester’s half and moving the blue shirts expertly around. When Jamie Vardy threatened to break towards De Gea at speed, Eric Bailly’s assurance in killing the danger underlined United’s control.\nJust before the 20-minute mark United appeared to have a fair goal scrubbed out. Lukaku swivelled and fired at Schmeichel. The Dane saved well but the ball rebounded to Juan Mata, who finished having pounced from a seemingly onside position but the assistant referee’s flag was raised.\nAfter last year’s two trophies Old Trafford is a more vibrant arena. So it was that the noise ratcheted up when they next attacked. Lukaku threaded a clever pass to Martial along the left, he flipped a cross to the far post and Paul Pogba’s diving attempt went wide of Schmeichel’s right post. A breathless couple of minutes was completed when the keeper’s athleticism was again required to repel an effort from Mata.\nLeicester offered flashes of quality in the rare openings they had. Shinji Okazaki’s sudden shot from 25 yards had to be monitored by De Gea but this was as close as the visitors were allowed to the Spaniard’s goal.\nMost of the action was at the other end. Twice Pogba unloaded at Schmeichel from long range and Mourinho will have been pleased by how his midfielder bossed proceedings. He will be less happy with United’s inability to make their domination count. The sense was that a first strike might again herald a few goals for the home side, yet as half-time neared the game remained deadlocked as a 35-yard free-kick from Pogba smacked the wall and landed safely in Schmeichel’s hands.\nMourinho’s instruction for the second half might have been to be more ruthless. His team’s opening gambit was to pepper Schmeichel’s area again. Mata and Pogba aimed in crosses but both failed to find a team-mate. Martial was one of United’s better performers and it was his darting run that came close to prising Leicester open. He passed to Lukaku, who tried to turn but went down when tussling with Harry Maguire.\n\n\n\n\nJoselu blows away Newcastle gloom and adds to the pressure on Slaven Bilic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext Martial won the penalty from which Lukaku missed. The forward’s attempted delivery from the left hit Danny Simpson’s arm and Michael Oliver pointed at the spot. After Schmeichel debated the decision with the referee, Lukaku smacked the penalty to his right and the keeper made yet another fine save.\nMoments later frustration for United nearly became despair when Riyad Mahrez bamboozled Phil Jones and skipped in along the right but De Gea saved his fierce drive. Next Mkhitaryan spurned a golden opening from Mata’s balletic twirl and pass. Instead of shooting straight away, his elaboration led to the chance vanishing.\nWhen Shakespeare brought on Andy King and Demarai Gray for Okazaki and Marc Albrighton before the hour, Mourinho responded by bringing on Rashford for Mata in what proved a decisive move. Almost instantly came Rashford’s moment, as he was left unmarked to volley home. “Set pieces are our achilles heel at the moment,” Shakespeare said.\nFrom here United closed the match down, Fellaini’s point-blank finish after some good work by Jesse Lingard – another replacement – sealing victory.\nUnited have nine points, have scored 10 times and are yet to concede. It is an excellent beginning to their tilt at claiming a 21st title.\nMourinho: I am happy for Marouane, for Jesse, for Marcus\nJosé Mourinho praised his substitutes after they were key in maintaining Manchester United’s 100% start to the season in the 2-0 win over Leicester. United head into the international break with nine points from their opening three matches and at the top of the Premier League. They have scored 10 times and are yet to concede.\nAfter facing stiff resistance from the visitors and seeing Romelu Lukaka’s penalty saved Mourinho brought on Marcus Rashford, who put United ahead, and Marouane Fellaini, who scored shortly after coming on, having been set up by another substitute, Jesse Lingard, to seal United’s third victory in as many fixtures.\nThe 54-year-old refused to take credit for his substitutions but said: “This is about the quality of the players, the players are good, and not just good, they are motivated to help the players. It doesn’t matter if they play from the beginning, if they come from the bench. The group is solid, very, very friendly in between games and [there’s] great empathy. I’m really happy, not for me. When [managers] make changes, we always make the right changes, sometimes it works against us. I’m happy for them, for Marouane, for Jesse, for Marcus.”\nMourinho then turned to those critics who argue his tactics are overly defensive. “Maybe they are going to say that [I am defensive] because my team is not conceding goals,” he said. “Maybe they say I am defensive. We are playing well. Maybe in some matches we are going to be defensive and if the opponent is playing better than us we have to be pragmatic and defend but today we didn’t need that. I am not carried away, three matches, nine points is good, 10 goal difference is good.”\nHe added: “We are playing well. We didn’t have many matches last season where we played 90 minutes with the control we had today. Is [Jamie] Vardy a very dangerous player? I would say one of the most dangerous in the Premier League. Was he dangerous today? I would say no because we played very well to control that. Were Leicester very dangerous against Arsenal [in a 4-3 defeat]? Yes, I watched the match three times. Were they dangerous against us? No.”\nMourinho believes United’s work during the summer is key to the flying start. “We had a very good pre-season,” the manager said. “We worked really well. We had great conditions to work together, to be together in a beautiful atmosphere. We played against good teams, the best team in Europe [Real Madrid] twice. The pre-season was very complete and then we start the Premier League. We are playing well.” Jamie Jackson\n"

        "text": "\nIn terms of attention-grabbing headlines and photographs of Manchester United’s manager looking less than delighted with life, José Mourinho truly is the Christmas gift that keeps on giving. Yet amusing as it was to hear the erstwhile Special One complaining that his club have not yet spent enough to compete with the likes of Burnley and Leicester, it must be conceded that Mourinho has a point when he talks of a difference between big clubs and big teams.\nUnited are a big club, he suggested, but not yet a big team. They are trying to become a big team, though that is actually quite difficult when you have already been a big team once and are now trying to put the pieces of the jigsaw back together after a couple of previous managers have had a go.\n\n\n\n\nArsène Wenger tells José Mourinho to learn to live with Manchester City riches\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMourinho has spent around £260m since taking over at Old Trafford, which is around four or five times the cost of the entire Burnley team, but that is what the have and have not Premier League is like. The essential difference between the clubs is that Burnley have never had any money, far less any plans to rule Europe or compete on a level footing with the best in Spain and Italy, so when Sean Dyche goes shopping he does not visit the same store as Mourinho, perhaps not even the same street or city.\nThere is absolutely no chance, in other words, of Burnley spending £90m on Paul Pogba, a player United had in the first place but let go for next to nothing. Not because Burnley don’t have £90m to spend on any one player – although naturally they don’t – but because they would never have let him go so cheaply in the first instance. Burnley do business like most clubs do business. They either use their best players or make sure they sell them for the best possible price. What happened to Pogba could only take place at a big club like United, both the letting go and the buying back.\nIt could never be regarded as an example of good housekeeping, either on Sir Alex Ferguson’s watch or Mourinho’s, though in defence of the latter the two midfielders he had inherited from his predecessors were Marouane Fellaini and Bastian Schweinsteiger. Needing to both stamp his personality on the team and begin building a side that could once again compete for top honours in this country and abroad, Mourinho paid over the odds to bring Pogba back. The following summer he went out and bought Nemanja Matic, another obvious though expensive capture, and one that until a few weeks ago was being hailed as a masterstroke.\nMatic did improve United – he would be good in almost any team – but suddenly all the superlatives were being diverted to Manchester City. Until the festive period at least United were in good shape and playing well, as were Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur. But playing well is not quite the same as winning 17 matches in a row. No one can compete with that, although if you are Mourinho you can point out that they paid as much for a new set of full backs as most teams spend on strikers. If that seemed unnecessarily curmudgeonly given one of the full backs will miss the season through injury and City have still been winning plaudits for flowing football and solid defending, bear in mind it cannot be easy trying to overhaul United when there is a conspicuously better side not just in the same league but in the same city.\nSince Ferguson’s first title-winning side at least, the assumption has always been that a fully-functioning Manchester United, properly funded and sensibly led, would naturally be the strongest team in England. Even Ferguson had to accept second place to Arsenal or Chelsea on occasion, though the interruption to normal service would usually be short and with a few tweaks and a little squad strengthening United would be back on their perch.\nThat was broadly the imagined scenario when Mourinho moved to Manchester. He might not have been ideal in some ways, he would probably not stay all that long and he would almost certainly attract the wrong sort of publicity, but if he could turn Louis van Gaal’s painfully ponderous side into a version of Chelsea it would at least be a step in the right direction. United would start winning things again, and as soon as that happened they could return to hoovering up the best available talent and generally lording it over the rest of the country.\nWhatever you think of José, it was said, he’s a proven winner. If he comes across as more of a proven whinger these days that is entirely down to City blocking off the high ground and forcing everyone else to look upwards. Mourinho is now caught in the middle of a United rebuilding project with no immediate prospect of success. For all the investment, United appear to be little better off than they were under Van Gaal and his three-year plan. There is a residual fondness for the idea that United might trump City’s league success by winning big in Europe, just as they did in 1968, though half a century ago there was only one English team in Europe. Now there are five, and several of them would be confident if drawn against United, partly because Mourinho’s strategy in the big games this season has been so reactive.\n\n\n\n\nJosé Mourinho says ‘£300m not enough’ for Manchester United to compete\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Mourinho said United’s spending so far had not been enough to compete, he meant with City and the top sides around Europe, not Burnley. It was just unfortunate that his comments came after being held at home by everyone’s favourite small-town punchers above their weight.\nSo what should the club hierarchy do now, especially with January coming up? Back Mourinho to the hilt in the transfer market or put up with the noise from the neighbours for a few more years? Neither option seems particularly appealing but it will have to be one or the other. The one thing big clubs cannot do is go unnoticed. No one talks about it now but Burnley were relegated a couple of years ago. Just shrugged and got on with it. Didn’t even change their manager. That’s where they get much of their team spirit and cohesiveness from, apparently, but it is an avenue closed to United.\nWhen big clubs fail they fail big, because they are always in the spotlight. Were a team like Burnley to finish second to Manchester City it would probably be an occasion for street parties in east Lancashire, whereas for United there would be little cause for any sort of celebration. Because it is now almost five years since Ferguson stood down, and just as long since United looked capable of winning the league. Worse than that, it is becoming evident that all that time City were working to a plan that has now come to fruition, and could continue to yield dividends for some years to come.\nIt is not yet clear whether Mourinho’s warning that more money will have to be spent is part of a rebuilding programme or merely a diversionary tactic, but United do need a plan at this stage, and it is going to have to be a belter.\n"

They are two different things,” he said. “We are in the second year of trying to rebuild a football team that is not one of the best teams in the world. Manchester City buy full-backs for the price of strikers. When you speak about big football clubs, you are speaking about the history of the club.”\nWhen it was put to Mourinho he has invested £300m since taking over – it is actually closer to £261m – he responded: “It is not enough. And the price for the big clubs, the price for the big clubs is different from the other clubs. So the big, historical clubs are normally punished in the market for that history.\n“When you tell [describe] a club like Manchester United, do you think Milan is not as big as us? You think they are not as big as we are? Do you think Real Madrid are not as big as we are? You think Inter Milan is not as big as we are? There are many big clubs and you say big clubs, I know what is a big club.”\nMourinho was then asked if he intended to spend a lot of money in the January transfer window but left the room before answering.\nCity spent £130m on the defenders Benjamin Mendy, Kyle Walker and Danilo in the summer, while United paid more than £140m for Romelu Lukaku, Nemanja Matic and Victor Lindelof. Having seen his side miss out on victory against 10-man Leicester City on Saturday following an injury-time goal, Mourinho was once more angered by their defensive display.\nUnited trailed Burnley to strikes from Ashley Barnes and Steven Defour and Mourinho criticised his players for allowing the visitors to take the lead in the third minute after Lukaku failed to clear. “Another ‘s’ goal. I don’t need to say the other letters of the word,” he said. “That is what we are having now, lots of ‘s’ goals against so that has an impact in the game.\n“The end product of so much dominance, two goals, is a miserable number. The boys do what they can, they are trying hard with the problems and injuries we have. I am not happy with the result, and against Leicester, but I am happy with my players. The quality of our play, the risk that we took today and also against Leicester, the team that deserved to win both matches is us.”\n"

        "text": "\nGareth Southgate has praised Marcus Rashford’s growing maturity and believes England are reaping the benefits from a clear career pathway, identified in conjunction with the coaching staff at Manchester United, aimed at tapping into the striker’s immense potential.\nRashford gained his 11th cap against Slovakia on Monday, making his third start for the senior side, and recovered from an early defensive error to score his first Wembley goal and move England to within two points of qualification for the World Cup. Those discussions with United began two seasons ago when Southgate was in charge of the under-21s. The England set-up spoke at length with the former Wales forward Ryan Giggs, then Louis van Gaal’s assistant at Old Trafford, over how best to maintain the teenager’s development.\n\n\n\n\nWembley’s sullen mood dispelled by a touch of class from Marcus Rashford | Barney Ronay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“United prepare their players well, which is why they end up the way they do,” said Southgate. “To play in front of 70,000 people every week, they bring them up in a way that you know the kind of player they will be before they walk through the door. We have had Marcus, Jesse Lingard, Michael Keane … so there is a certain type they develop because they are given good values. Marcus has a great platform to build from, and he has a good influence at his clubs in terms of José Mourinho to keep him grounded. We will do the same here.\n“What has been nice on his pathway is that it is all joined up. We used to speak to Ryan Giggs about which team to put him in because we didn’t want to put him in the under-21s too early. Up to this point he has been really well handled and we have to continue to do that. Ryan was assistant manager and Marcus had just broken into the team. We felt the under-21s would put too much spotlight on him and I think United were grateful for that. Albeit Roy Hodgson ended up picking him for the seniors two months later. No, in truth, you could see the impact he had straight away.”\nSouthgate, having taken up the reins of the senior side, opted to select Rashford for the World Cup qualifier against Scotland in Glasgow in June rather than releasing him to play for the under-21s at the European Championships in Poland. The forward had marked his only appearance for Aidy Boothroyd’s junior side with a hat-trick against Norway, but that decision to omit him from the summer tournament was made in an attempt to “protect” the player after a first full season in senior football in which he played 53 games for United and scored 11 goals, having been a part of Hodgson’s squad at Euro 2016.\n\n\n\n\nMarcus Rashford bounces back against Slovakia and England grab the win\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“He has the mental strength and, like Wayne Rooney and Michael Owen, is mature in terms of his understanding of the game and the way he picks up concepts,” said Southgate. “When he first came he didn’t know the group, but he was happy to speak in meetings. He has a lot of humility. I’ve met his mum, his brothers, and they are a good influence. We must also play a part and make sure he is looked after and we have shown that with the decision we made over the summer with the under-21s. But after the way he started this season at United we wanted him to play a part against Slovakia.”\nIt had taken an injury crisis at United under Van Gaal to thrust Rashford into the first-team picture. “It does make you wonder, though, how many others are there?” added Southgate. “In fairness to United, he is a player they have always liked. When I have spoken to [the former United reserve team manager] Warren Joyce they recognised the talent and the mentality. But, really, he was behind James Wilson who was on loan, Ashley Fletcher who was on loan.\n“How many other examples are there? I don’t know, but kids need opportunity. When the opportunity presents itself you have to take it – we talked about that as a team ahead of the Slovakia game, and he did that. He hasn’t looked back. Maybe, if you miss that moment, for some it is too late. Hopefully, with the summer we have had with our junior teams, clubs will have a bit more faith in young English players.”\n"

        "text": "\nIt was all looking so good for José Mourinho. Having seen his Manchester United side come back from conceding the opening goal to lead 2-1 through two strikes from Juan Mata, a last minute lapse of concentration in defence allowed Harry Maguire to snatch a point with the final kick of the match.\nUnited had appeared to be coasting when the Leicester substitute Daniel Amartey was sent off for a second booking 16 minutes from time, with Jesse Lingard wasting a golden opportunity to seal the points when he struck a post. But just as it seemed Mourinho’s side would at least keep pace with Manchester City after their record-breaking 17th win in a row, Maguire’s volley at the back post ensured they now face a 13-point gap with half of the campaign completed.\n\n\n\n\nJosé Mourinho rails against players’ ‘childish decisions’ after Leicester draw\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis ground has bad memories for the Portuguese after the 2-1 defeat to Claudio Ranieri’s title-chasers two years ago proved to be the last act in his second spell as Chelsea manager. There have been shades of the manager who lost control so quickly at Stamford Bridge about Mourinho’s demeanour this season and his reaction to the dropping of two vital points was an indication that the pressure being applied by Pep Guardiola’s side is taking its toll.\nIt was unclear exactly who he was singling out for the “childish decisions” that he said cost his side so dear but the finger could probably be pointed at Chris Smalling, who was left bamboozled by Riyad Mahrez’s quick feet for Jamie Vardy’s opening goal and was then at fault for allowing Maguire to pounce at the death. Yet the evening could have ended so differently had United been more clinical in front of goal, with Anthony Martial also spurning a great chance just after the break.\nIn a week in which they had also crashed out of the League Cup to the Championship side Bristol City, the return of Paul Pogba to Premier League action after his suspension at least gave Mourinho a reason to be cheerful, with the Frenchman captaining the side in the absence of Antonio Valencia – one of only three players to keep his place from the defeat at Ashton Gate.\nAfter four straight victories under Claude Puel, Leicester’s bubble had been burst by the surprise home defeat to Crystal Palace last Saturday and the penalty shootout loss to City. Their manager was criticised for starting that game with Vardy and Mahrez on the bench when the competition perhaps represented their best chance of silverware, and Puel reverted to his first choice side for this match.\nBut it was United who took the game to their opponents in the opening exchanges. Smalling should have done better with a headed chance from Juan Mata’s centre in the third minute, while Lingard and Pogba tested Kasper Schmeichel with early efforts. But after the initial burst, the visitors began to look laboured going forward, with Romelu Lukaku again struggling to make an impact.\nHaving created virtually nothing beforehand, however, it was a classic piece of counterattacking that helped Leicester go ahead. Lingering around the edge of his own penalty area, the England forward pounced on a clearance and laid the ball into the path of Wilfred Ndidi, whose first-time pass sailed over the United defence and into the path of the onrushing Mahrez. The Algerian was forced to check his run slightly but showed great awareness to pause briefly before laying the ball to Vardy on a plate.\nTheir joy was short-lived, though, as a canny left-footed finish from just inside the area from Mata after a clever layoff from Lingard meant United headed into the break on level terms. Despite that setback, Leicester persisted with the tactic of sitting deep and attempting to strike out on the break.\n\n\n\n\nLeicester City v Manchester United: Premier League – live!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe strategy almost paid dividends seven minutes into the second half when more brilliance from Mahrez saw him reach the byline, only for Demarai Gray to miss the ball completely when it was played across the face of goal, with David de Gea saving the follow-up from Christian Fuchs.\nMartial partially redeemed himself for the miss when he won a free-kick just outside the penalty area and Mata stepped up to curl home his second goal, although Schmeichel will feel he could have done more to prevent the ball finding the net having presented his opponent with a yawning gap to aim at.\nAmartey’s second booking, for a reckless bodycheck on Marcus Rashford less than 20 minutes after he had replaced Danny Simpson, seemed to have ended the game as a contest.\nBut in the final seconds of injury time, everything fell apart for United. Marc Albrighton’s excellent deep cross picked out the unmarked Maguire at the back post and, having fluffed a great chance earlier, this time the England defender made no mistake, to send United into the Christmas period knowing their hopes of a 21st title are virtually over already.\n"

        "text": "\nThe chase feels forlorn, and it must be even more dispiriting for Manchester United when they play the day after their neighbours have turned in yet another stirring performance, but José Mourinho and his players can at least take some satisfaction from the fact they managed to trim the deficit at the top back to 11 points.\nThey made much harder work of it than they should have done, with Gareth Barry’s goal 13 minutes from time forcing United to endure a slightly anxious finale after they had appeared to be coasting at 2-0, but a third successive Premier League away win was eventually chalked off courtesy of the first-half goals that Romelu Lukaku and Jesse Lingard scored.\nWhether their win keeps the title race alive is open to debate – and maybe not a very long one given the way that Manchester City are playing at the moment – but Mourinho certainly has no plans to raise a white flag at Old Trafford anytime soon. “We don’t want to go on holidays, we want to play until the last match,” the United manager said.\nAll that can be said for now is that United have no margin for error, which is why it was so important that they managed to weather Albion’s late storm. Jay Rodriguez had a chance to snatch an equaliser in those closing minutes, and Mourinho would no doubt have been much more animated had that header from Chris Brunt’s superb cross landed inside David de Gea’s near post.\n\n\n\n\nWest Bromwich Albion 1-2 Manchester United: Premier League – as it happened\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMourinho preferred to give credit to Albion for the way the game finished rather than raising any questions about his own players, with the United manager highlighting the home team’s set-piece threat that led to Barry turning the ball over the line after Brunt’s corner had ricocheted off Marcos Rojo. Remarkably, it was Barry’s first goal as a substitute in the Premier League since 1999.\nThe introduction of the 36-year-old at the interval was a key factor in a much-improved second-half performance from Albion, with Alan Pardew later admitting that he was guilty of picking the wrong team. Brunt’s arrival from the bench also made a difference and Albion will take some encouragement from the way they finished a match that delivered their first goal since Pardew took over as manager. “That was psychologically important,” Pardew said.\nThe harsh reality, though, is that Albion remain second from bottom – they will be propping up the table if Swansea win at Everton on Monday – and their club-record run of matches without a win in all competitions has now been stretched to 17. Next is a trip to Stoke, who are two points and two places above them, and Albion desperately need to come away with something from that fixture.\nIt was one of their former players who inflicted the early damage here. Lukaku, who spent the 2012-13 season on loan at Albion, towered above Kieran Gibbs – a mismatch if ever there was one – to nod Marcus Rashford’s inswinging cross beyond Ben Foster and emphatically into the top corner. It was a fine header, although Lukaku chose not to celebrate scoring for the second game running.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Gareth Barry scores after a goalmouth scramble for West Brom’s first goal under Alan Pardew. Photograph: Robbie Jay Barratt - AMA/West Bromwich Albion FC via Gett\n\n\n“I think there are two reasons for that,” Mourinho said. “He was a happy kid here and it was here that he exploded in the Premier League. And probably the second thing is, he looks at me and I don’t celebrate, too.”\nMourinho put his own subdued reaction down to “experience” and the fact that he has “changed” before promising that he would be charging down the touchline again if his team score a last‑minute winner. In truth, a much bigger concern for him at the Hawthorns was the sight of Antonio Valencia, who is such a reliable performer at right-back, pulling up with a hamstring problem. “It’s what I call a December injury – the accumulation of fatigue,” said Mourinho, who has no idea how long Valencia will spend on the sidelines.\nLukaku’s header was actually the first effort on target that either team had produced in a flat opening period, but United quickly followed up that 28th-minute goal with a second. There was an element of good fortune about it as Ahmed Hegazi, the Albion central defender, stuck out his left boot to try to block Lingard’s low shot from the edge of the area, deflecting the ball past Foster, who was left wrong-footed.\nRashford and Lingard both had chances to add to United’s lead early in the second half, although Pardew felt the home team should have been awarded a penalty prior to Barry’s goal, when Ashley Young barged James McClean out of the way so that De Gea could gather the ball. Pardew may well have had a point, yet he also accepted that Albion failed to help themselves at times. “You can’t win games unless you have ambition,” he said. “And it was only really when Gareth Barry and Brunty came on that we looked to me like we had the ambition to go and get something.”\n"

        "text": "\nHaving spent much of December harping on about not having enough money to spend, and how much he dislikes the January transfer window anyway, José Mourinho will use the January transfer window to spend a load of money. First on his shopping list is Antoine Griezman, who he’ll offer £300,000-a-week to in order to convince him that relentlessly tracking back at Old Trafford will be more rewarding than relentlessly banging in goals for Barcelona, who have also been sniffing about.\nFollowing his swipe at Pep Guardiola for spending “striker money” on full backs, Mourinho will offer Napoli £53m for left-back Faouzi Ghoulam (allowing them to buy Benfica’s Alejandro Grimaldo in his place) before commissioning a brass statue of his own neck to replace the one of Fergie outside the ground. Next on the Manchester United list is PSG’s Lucas Moura, who they have apparently “opened talks over”, before a £50m bid for Barcelona defender Samuel Umtiti.\n\n\n\n\nSwansea keen to sign Sakho from West Ham but wages scupper Ayew move\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAntonio Conte is well aware of Chelsea’s (not terribly successful) attempts to promote players from their garlanded academy, and a policy of buying young players with a long future. So fair play to him for sticking two fingers up to that and upping his interest in Bayern’s 30-year-old midfielder Arturo Vidal and Juve’s 33-year-old Giorgio Chiellini. The latter, however, has been hinting that he’s likely to stay in Turin anyway.\nBesiktas have noted Everton’s interest in Cenk Tosun, have spotted the pictures the striker has posted of himself gadding about in London, and added another £2m to his price tag – taking it to £27m – just because they can. Sam Allardyce is not for being pushed around, however, so may simply sign Steven N’Zonzi from Sevilla instead.\nBrighton (and Hove Albion actually) have taken the sensible step of asking Moussa Dembélé if he is actually interested in signing for them before they dig out the fax machine, fire it up and ping off an offer to Celtic for him. But they’ll be perfectly happy to let Jamie Murphy head to Rangers given he’s been free to spend more time mooching about The Lanes than playing on the Amex pitch this season. \nIn more Scottish news, Celtic and West Ham are girding their loins for a Benny Hill-style chase for Hibs’s 23-year-old midfielder John McGinn. West Ham have other business to attend to as well – chiefly flogging Diafra Sakho for as close to £20m as they can, and then persuading Swansea’s Alfie Mawson and Ki Sung-yeung to ditch one listing ship for another.\nKortney Hause is working out which of the coy sideways glances he’s been getting from both Huddersfield and Watford are the most significant after getting limited playing time at Wolves. It may well turn out to be Watford, given Huddersfield manager David Wagner has also been giving the glad eye to Monaco defender Terence Kongolo, drooling: “We like him”.\n And Philippe Coutinho, Nike, Barcelona, Zzzzzzzz.\n"

Further goals from Anthony Martial and Paul Pogba on 87 and 90 minutes put Mourinho’s team top of the Premier League on goal difference.\nAfterwards Lukaku, the club’s £75m summer signing, revealed he is revelling in the responsibility Mourinho has placed on his shoulders. “The manager wants me to be a leader for the team and create as much as I can,” the 24-year-old said. “We work hard in training and it is paying off. When you play for Manchester United you have a job to do and mine is to score goals. It is promising. The fans want to see attractive football and we have to stick to that. They will be pleased today. It is just the start. We need to keep working to the manager’s plan.”\nOf Lukaku’s instant impact, Mourinho said: “He scored in the Super Cup [defeat by Real Madrid], he scored today. He is playing well, he is working hard. He likes the team and the team likes him. For every striker, he can play phenomenally well but, if he doesn’t score goals, he is not happy.

He said: “The fact we start winning and are top, it means nothing. The performance and the levels of confidence is what means a lot to me. We lost two points against them last season [in a 1-1 draw] and had similar games where we dominated. Today we got the three points. The reality is that in the last part of the game, instead of being boring and controlling the game, we scored a third goal and we could enjoy it. What pleased the most was the win. Because many times last season we deserved to win and didn’t so the fact we won the match was the most important thing.

Mourinho brought him in from Chelsea for £40m and was asked why the champions had allowed the sale.\n“It depends on what is happening or what was happening behind doors and we don’t know,” he said. “I never thought it was possible unless something special was happening and his agent told me something special was happening. We have him and we are very happy. He was a player this team needs.”\nMourinho suggested Victor Lindelof, a central defender who cost £31m in the close season, needs time to adjust. The Swede did not make the match-day squad, and the manager said: “Real Madrid [in the Super Cup] was too early for him. He played because [Phil] Jones and [Eric] Bailly were both suspended. I had players coming from different leagues to the Premier League and normally it is not easy.\n“Lukaku and Matic have years of experience of the Premier League. Ricardo Carvalho was one of the best defenders in the history of the Premier League but in the beginning he struggled. Victor needs time and he will get time.”\nSlaven Bilic, the West Ham manager, admitted: “They were better with the ball and better without the ball.”\n"

As it was, they shouldn’t be too greedy. Romelu Lukaku has wasted little time demonstrating why he became the club’s most expensive summer recruit and, on this evidence, it is shaping up to be a season of rich promise for José≈ Mourinho’s team.\nLukaku should certainly have dispelled any lingering self-doubt with the two goals that laid the foundations for the most emphatic league win of the Mourinho era. Not that the £75m signing displayed even a flicker of stage fright with the left-foot finish and close-range header with which he introduced himself to the Old Trafford crowd.\n\n\n\n\nNewcastle’s Jonjo Shelvey sees red as Dele Alli has last laugh for Tottenham\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLukaku ended a hugely satisfying afternoon waving appreciatively to the Stretford End and he might have finished with the ball as a souvenir had it not been for a brilliant saving tackle by Pablo Zabaleta, one of three West Ham debutants, to deny him a hat-trick just after the hour.\nYet this was more than just a story of Lukaku easing into life in Manchester and, though the new signing deserves the headlines, the form of Marcus Rashford and Paul Pogba, among others, should also fill Mourinho with optimism that his team are capable of significant improvement after last season’s sixth-placed finish.\nPotential champions? You wouldn’t bet your mortgage against it and, for what it is worth at this time of the season, this rout puts them top already. Mourinho also made the point afterwards that we should anticipate the team getting better. “I’m not going to say the performance was perfect because it wasn’t perfect. There is still room for improvement.”\nHenrikh Mkhitaryan was another of the star performers and, not for the first time, it felt faintly ludicrous that Chelsea had allowed Nemanja Matic to defect to one of their title rivals. Matic fitted in seamlessly and the home side were not flattered by the late one-two when the substitute Anthony Martial slotted in the third goal, quickly followed by the brilliantly effective Pogba knocking another in from 20 yards. It was a tepid show from West Ham and they have now lost 11 opening-day fixtures in the Premier League era, more than any other club.\nAs the crowd serenaded Mourinho and Joe Hart, West Ham’s new goalkeeper, was reminded that it was a long way down since he was winning championships with Manchester City, it did not seem to matter too much that Victor Lindelof, the £31m acquisition from Benfica, was not even in the home squad because of his unimpressive form in pre-season.\nAnother manager might have felt duty-bound to involve such a costly signing. Mourinho does not operate with those kinds of constraints and Phil Jones was recalled alongside Eric Bailly to make sure Javier Hernández did not have a profitable return to Old Trafford.\nHernández scored 37 goals in 103 league games during his days in Manchester and one imagines he would have loved the kind of chances that Lukaku’s team-mates served up for the Belgian. Mkhitaryan’s expertly delivered free-kick for the second goal was the case in point. Rashford’s beautifully weighted pass for the first was another. These are the opportunities Lukaku thrives upon and, as long as it continues this way, he should get a hatful this season. Rashford was also involved in the second goal, having been chopped down by Zabaleta for the free-kick, and the teenager curled another shot against the post before Martial took over for the last 10 minutes.\nThese are early days but Mourinho, slowly but surely, seems to be assembling a side with no obvious weaknesses and Matic’s contribution for the first goal was a splendid snapshot of why he had been added to the payroll. Matic played with great control and it was his interception, cutting out Pedro Obiang’s pass, that sent Rashford haring away on the counter-attacking move that led to Lukaku scoring from 12 yards.\nWest Ham had defended stoutly until that point but they set about the afternoon with a distinct lack of adventure and there were only sporadic moments when their new-look frontline of Hernández, Marko Arnautovic and André Ayew flickered into life. Arnautovic had their best moment with a looping header that David de Gea tipped over the crossbar but the score was 2-0 at that stage and, for the most part, Slaven Bilic’s men were pinned inside their own half. “They were better than us in every department,” Bilic reflected. “We are very low.”\nMkhitaryan’s precise pass left Martial with the opportunity to stroke in the third goal and the away end was rapidly emptying as Pogba added the final flourish and Hart was beaten for the second time in three minutes. “The fans have reason to be optimistic,” Mourinho said.\n"

The 35-year-old is continuing his rehabilitation programme after the cruciate ligament injury suffered against Anderlecht in April but has told José Mourinho he would like to play again for the club he joined in 2016 from Paris Saint-Germain.\n\n\n\n\nJosé Mourinho says it’s ‘game over’ in Manchester United’s Gareth Bale chase\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMourinho is open to the idea of the striker being a part of United’s squad and it is now up to the Swede to prove his fitness. A new short-term contract would also have to be agreed but it is understood both parties are keen to compromise in order to conclude a deal to prolong Ibrahimovic’s Old Trafford career.\nIbrahimovic, who will be 36 in October, scored 28 goals last season and was by far the club’s most prolific goalscorer. United have signed Romelu Lukaku for £75m this summer and would not need Ibrahimovic to lead the line in the way he did but feel, with a Champions League campaign coming up, that he would add cover for Lukaku, Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial.\nMourinho hinted on the eve of the Super Cup against Real Madrid in Skopje, which United lost 2-1, that the former Juventus, Milan and PSG striker could rejoin the club this season. “Maybe he’ll stay with us,” Mourinho said. “He’s not got a contract but he’s still close to Manchester and the fact we are involved in the Super Cup now is also his merit.”\nUnited, who start their Premier League campaign at home to West Ham on Sunday, have also signed Victor Lindelof from Benfica and Nemanja Matic from Chelsea but have been frustrated in their pursuit of the Internazionale winger Ivan Perisic.\n"

        "text": "\nThe question was harmless enough but the response was revealing. In the King Power Stadium, with the pain of Leicester City’s late equaliser still raw, José Mourinho stared incredulously at his inquisitor and snarled back without pausing.\n“Do you think I’m worried with that now, in this moment? With captain and Paul and Paul and captain? No. Do you have any more questions about the game?”\n“It’s related to the game,” came the reply.\n\n\n\n\nPremier League fans’ half-time verdict - part 2: Manchester City to West Ham\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“No, it’s not related to the game,” said Mourinho, rising from his chair. “What do you mean the armband? What is the influence in the game?”\n“We’re just trying to do our job and get a line.”\n“Which line? The line of the captain? Pfff. That’s not a line,” the Manchester United manager shrugged dismissively as he started walking towards the door. “Any more questions? Merry Christmas, eh.”\nEven as Mourinho rants go, his reaction to being asked about Paul Pogba’s first Premier League match as United captain was one of the more bizarre matters over which to lose his temper. But this has been a month in which the 54-year-old has been involved in a tunnel bust-up at Old Trafford, walked out of a press conference accusing the media of a lack of respect for Bournemouth, and referred to Bristol City as lucky after a cup defeat. He is growing increasingly frustrated as Manchester City sweep all before them.\nAccusing his players of making “childish decisions” in the dying moments of Saturday’s match was an indication that Mourinho is quickly losing patience with some of the senior members of his squad, with Anthony Martial, Ashley Young and Chris Smalling – forced to play on with an injury because United had no substitutes remaining – the potential culprits he had in mind.\nIt brought back memories of his bitter attack on his Chelsea side after their defeat at Leicester a little more than two years ago. On that occasion Mourinho accused his players of betraying him as they suffered a ninth league defeat of the season despite having won the title a few months earlier – he was sacked two days later. Although there is a long way to go before he reaches that scale of meltdown, there is compelling evidence that the early stages of his notorious third-season syndrome may have arrived way ahead of schedule.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  A question about Paul Pogba, left, captaining Manchester United at Leicester prompted José Mourinho to lose his temper. Photograph: Plumb Images/Leicester City FC via Getty Imag\n\n\nFor a manager who has never failed to win the domestic title in his second season at any of his clubs, it is easy to understand why. Even with United starting the second half of the season in their highest position since they won the Premier League in 2013, Mourinho finds his team cut adrift of Pep Guardiola’s City. A lack of professionalism against Leicester cost them, with Martial and Jesse Lingard spurning opportunities to secure a win.\nBut the withering assessment that there was a “lack of maturity” is unlikely to have been well received in the dressing room, especially by Young, whom Mourinho accused of failing to get his message across. The England international has emerged as one of his most trusted lieutenants, captaining the side on more than one occasion this season, so it was surprising to hear him singled out.\nBut, as Mourinho admitted so publicly, the armband does not mean much to him. In the absence of the club captain, Michael Carrick, Antonio Valencia has been the regular choice for most of this season along with Smalling, with Pogba stepping in on Saturday. Perhaps that is part of the problem?\n\n\n\n\nJosé Mourinho rails against players’ ‘childish decisions’ after Leicester draw\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is difficult to imagine a United side containing Steve Bruce or Roy Keane succumbing to such a sloppy equaliser against 10 men with the last kick of the match and Mourinho’s inability to relay his instructions to his team via Young when Smalling was injured does not reflect well on the manager’s relationship with his team.\nA trusted captain can provide the crucial link between players and manager that appears to be missing at the moment – a role to which Pogba should be perfectly suited. His suspension for the Manchester derby was a bitter blow to Mourinho’s hopes of taking the game to City but with the midfielder back in the side it would make sense to entrust him with the captaincy for the long term.\nThe home fixture against Burnley on Boxing Day provides United with the chance of immediate redemption, and the subsequent games against Southampton and away at Everton must be won to stand any chance of keeping the title race alive. As Mourinho himself once said: “As the coach and leader you must be the master motivator of your team.” Now is the time for him to prove that his methods can still have an effect.\n"

This is the minimum demand and undeniable truth facing José Mourinho as he embarks on a second campaign leading the record 20-times champions.\nGiven the Portuguese’s backing in the transfer market, he has no excuses if they are not challengers. Last summer Mourinho acquired Paul Pogba for a then world record of £89m and followed that up this summer by buying Romelu Lukaku for £75m from Everton, a record between two British clubs, the central defender Victor Lindelof (£31m) and last week the midfielder Nemanja Matic (£40m).\nFactor in Henrikh Mkhitaryan (£30m) and Eric Bailly (£30m), who were also bought 12 months ago, and it is a £295m investment made by the Glazers, who own United. If Ivan Perisic or the AN Other forward Mourinho wants to complete his trading is recruited (for a minimum £45m), it will be close to £350m he has spent since taking charge.\n\nManchester United interactive\n\nDespite finishing in a lowly sixth place in the Premier League, last season was still a success. With Zlatan Ibrahimovic scoring 28 times in all competitions before a serious knee injury, Mourinho guided United to the EFL Cup and the Europa League. This last trophy completed United’s set of major honours and came with the precious prize of a Champions League place.\nAs the Europa League triumph left his men battle-hardened, Mourinho should set par performance in the continent’s elite club tournament at the quarter-finals, then back his managerial ability to see how much further he can take them. But it is the Premier League where the manager really believes his side can prosper. In Georgetown, Washington DC, before the final training session of the tour of the United States, Mourinho named Tottenham Hotspur as major favourites for the title while ranking United as having a fighting chance.\nDo not be fooled. Mourinho’s team is not perfect but has been built primarily for domestic competition. It is big and strong, a powerhouse outfit the manager will instruct to try and bully most opponents.\n\n\n\n\nLindelof’s struggles, Pogba’s leadership: Manchester United tour talking points\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA scan through his probable first XI illustrates this and points to weaknesses at left-back, No10, and in a wide attacking berth. The last two issues could be eased in a single acquisition if Mourinho obtains Perisic from Internazionale. Do that then United’s best side might read: De Gea; Valencia, Bailly, Jones/Lindelof, Blind/Darmian; Pogba, Matic; Rashford, Mkhitaryan, Perisic; Lukaku.\nThis 4-2-3-1 has no room for Ander Herrera so in a 4-3-3 to accommodate the Spaniard, Mkhitaryan would miss out and Perisic would play one side of Lukaku with Marcus Rashford the other. Mourinho also fielded a three centre-backs on tour and sees this as an option rather than a regular system for the coming campaign.\nWhichever way he goes, a formidable unit can be fielded on any match-day that would contain only a couple of players Mourinho has inherited and is lukewarm about – the centre-back Phil Jones and Daley Blind or Matteo Darmian, the potential left-backs.\nHis goalkeeper, De Gea, has a definite case for being the best in the world and of Antonio Valencia Mourinho says: “There is no better right-back in football.” Bailly has convinced he should be first-choice and not just a player with potential. Matic was an integral part of Mourinho’s last Chelsea title-winning team of 2014-15, Pogba is the Portuguese’s on-field personification, and of the front four of Lukaku, Rashford, Perisic and Mkhitaryan, only the last causes doubt.\n\nManchester United interactive\n\nOn Tuesday night in Skopje, United take on Real Madrid in the Uefa Super Cup final. After United were given a 1-0 schooling by Barcelona in their final outing in the States, Mourinho was open about the Catalan club and Real being on a different level to his side. The manager stated it is up to him to stymie the two Spanish giants with clever strategy. The encounter at the Philip II Arena in the Macedonian capital is a chance for Mourinho to do so but a more sure-fire way of achieving this is by beefing up recruitment. This should be straightforward but requires United to be more bullish. They must utilise the financial heft that was underlined by the £750m earned from the Adidas kit deal alone, plus Pogba’s presence as a statement of what United are building, to make a muscular move in the closing weeks of the transfer window.\nIf the ambition is to be the dominant Premier League force again and disrupt the Real-Barça-Bayern Munich continental hegemony, United need to target a player who would instantly improve them after scoring 18 Premier League goals last year, who is only 21, and has the requisite edge to perform at Old Trafford: Tottenham Hotspur’s Dele Alli.\n\n\n \n\n\nPlay Video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1:01\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Manchester: will the Guardiola-Mourinho rivalry finally kick off? – video\n\n\nThe major obstacles here are first, that Tottenham consider themselves rivals, and second, the supposed negotiating acumen of their chairman, Daniel Levy. If United were to offer, say, £120m – or 18 months of the Adidas cash – for Alli, then Levy would have to listen. In an instant the received wisdom he drives a near-impossible bargain would be blown away.\nOnly last week Mauricio Pochettino conceded the point. “The problem is so clear. We are not a club today that can compete with Manchester United and City for a player. We cannot fight,” the Spurs manager said. The subtext is that the reverse is also true. Tottenham could not resist if United made a British record offer for Alli.\nIt probably will not happen and if so a question should be asked: what is United’s true ambition if they are not prepared to ruffle a competitor’s feathers by trying this kind of move? In June Forbes rated the club the “world’s most valuable soccer team” worth $3.69bn (£2.79bn). What is the point of these riches if Ed Woodward, the executive vice-chairman, cannot call Levy and say, in effect, name your price? And if the bid did fail, United would still have reset the parameters of how Tottenham, Manchester City, Chelsea, Arsenal and Liverpool should view them in future windows.\nFor now, though, the coming campaign will be a first in 13 years without Wayne Rooney, who has departed for Everton. As he was a fading force United will not mourn the record goalscorer. Yet what upsets supporters is the lack of a title since 2013. That was claimed by Sir Alex Ferguson. The challenge for the Scot’s third successor is to land the big one again.\n\nWriters' prediction table 2017-18\n\n"

        "text": "\n1) Is the title race over after this result?\nThis 20th head-to-head meeting of the managers ended with José Mourinho on the wrong end of a defeat and Pep Guardiola the correct one. Indeed Manchester United lost for the first time in 40 matches at home, since Manchester City won at Old Trafford in last season’s corresponding fixture. Far more significant is City now lead by 11 points and whatever is said about there being 22 games and 66 points to play for, the title is there for Guardiola’s men to throw away. As Kevin De Bruyne had mentioned in the build-up, the victory means City have a near four-wins advantage and have now been victorious on the ground of the champions, Chelsea, and the current second-placed team. Unless the Catalan’s men implode he will claim City a third Premier League title in May.\n2) Released handbrake backfires for Mourinho\nWith the selection of Jesse Lingard, Anthony Martial and Marcus Rashford behind Romelu Lukaku, Mourinho could not be accused of parking the bus. If this threw up the poser of whether the trio of attackers would prove to be too gung-ho, the way Rashford raced past Kyle Walker and drew an early yellow card from the right-back was one answer. Then, when Rashford tracked back to help Ashley Young along United’s left another was given. Lingard’s closing down of Walker near City’s right-hand corner flag was another and the way Rashford slotted the equaliser also suggested Mourinho’s decision may be prescient. Yet against a relentless City it all amounted to zero as the three – either together or individually – were unable to come at their opponents as Guardiola’s attack did.\n\n\n\n\nWayne Rooney penalty earns Everton unlikely derby point at Liverpool\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3) Gabriel Jesus disappoints as he spurns chances\nIn dropping Sergio Agüero for the Brazilian, Guardiola traded a time‑proven lethal striker for an effervescent 20-year-old who had previously been No2 to the Argentinian. Jesus also has two goals fewer than Agüero’s 12 for City this season, and the way he spurned chances did not repay his manager’s trust. When put in by Raheem Sterling on one occasion, Jesus should have scored. Then a Fernandinho goal-bound shot hit him. There was a further scuffed attempt with the left boot and after 58 minutes Guardiola admitted his error by taking the Brazil striker off. But what must Agüero have thought when on came Eliaquim Mangala, a defender, for Jesus? The former’s crestfallen face at the final whistle spoke loudly.\n4) City’s centre-back axis is cause for concern\nRewind to early September and the league leaders’ glaring weakness in defence is shown up by a Liverpool who continually drove past Nicolás Otamendi with pace at the Etihad Stadium. Sadio Mané’s red card changed that contest and City scored five unanswered goals, yet here there was more evidence of the Argentinian’s fragility. So, too, regarding the injury‑ravaged Vincent Kompany, who was taken off at half‑time, as Fernandinho dropped to centre-back. Otamendi is a threat going forward, as was shown by his winner – a fifth goal of term – and hassling of Romelu Lukaku for David Silva’s opener, yet his mistake allowed Marcus Rashford’s equaliser. John Stones is unavailable with a hamstring problem, and if Kompany is ruled out again maybe City may finally prove vulnerable.\n\n\n\n\nLate Olivier Giroud equaliser spares Arsenal against Southampton\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5) No Pogba, no punch, no midfield control \nAfter the Frenchman returned from a long layoff due to a hamstring injury Mourinho admitted his team are weakened severely without him. Yet after six games back Pogba was suspended for red card at Arsenal so in came Ander Herrera, with the manager hoped his earlier admission would not come back to haunt him. It did. Before and after Rashford’s finish United lacked any control in midfield, when what Pogba offers is this and more – domination. Herrera is just not able to run a contest like the 24-year-old France international and the contest shone up this deficiency. Herrera was also lucky not to concede a penalty when grappling with Otamendi and was later booked for an obvious dive near the same player in City’s area.\n"

        "text": "\nOpinion has been divided on the wisdom of Chelsea selling Nemanja Matic to Manchester United for £40m. There are those who say top teams, especially defending champions, should never sell to direct rivals, and those who believe the money was too good to refuse down for a player who has just turned 29.\nIt is being argued that Chelsea have just signed an upgrade in Tiémoué Bakayoko for the same price, at least a player Antonio Conte regarded as an upgrade in the same position, and at just 22 the promising France midfielder offers many more years of service than Matic, whose sale effectively means the former Monaco player has joined for free.\n\n\n\n\nLukaku’s power and Rashford’s pace give Manchester United renewed hope | Jamie Jackson\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll of that makes sense, yet what is equally undeniable is that United were delighted to land Matic, a player José Mourinho knows well, and that along with Romelu Lukaku the two new signings made highly promising debuts in the first game of the season at Old Trafford. Never mind for the moment that United were only playing West Ham, or that it is usually unwise to read too much into the first game of the season, the question to be asked is why Chelsea are making life so easy for their former manager and his new team.\nLukaku, let us not forget, was originally a Chelsea player and was widely expected to return to Stamford Bridge when he left Everton. Perhaps so widely expected that Chelsea may have let the grass grow under their feet and failed to anticipate United making a pre-emptive strike. Conte was understood to be furious – when is he ever otherwise? – and has appeared to be unhappy with his employers ever since and ended up buying Álvaro Morata, all too clearly a second-choice target and one who was not trusted to start on the opening day.\nWe all know how that went. Morata did come on to start a belated fightback as Chelsea lost their bearings and most of their composure against Burnley, but as striking debuts go it was nothing to compare with Lukaku – “the manager wants me to be a leader for the team” – and the beginning-of-a-new-era feeling most observers noted at Old Trafford.\nMatic had as much to do with that as anyone, and it is probably worth bearing in mind that Mourinho was being linked with Eric Dier for most of the summer because he originally imagined the Serb would be off limits. “Generally I do not like to chase impossible targets,” the United manager explained ahead of the West Ham game. “There is no point being seen to make moves for players you cannot get. I could see when I first came to United that we needed a Matic-type player, but there are not many around and I did not think Matic would move. Then all that changed with a phone call. I heard that he wanted to join United and could make it happen.”\nSo either Chelsea set the ball rolling or allowed Matic to do it himself. Mourinho did not need asking twice. Like Lukaku, Matic had once been a Chelsea player who had struggled to get a first-team look-in. He was sold to Benfica in 2011 as part of the deal that brought David Luiz to London, and it is a measure of how highly he was rated by Mourinho that when the manager returned for a second spell at Stamford Bridge one of the first things he did was buy him back.\nSo Chelsea could not have been surprised by Mourinho’s continuing admiration for the midfielder. Perhaps not many other managers would have sanctioned £40m for a player of his age, but in the general scheme of things that money does not represent a stumbling block for United and even at that price Mourinho’s eyes must have lit up like a child presented with a birthday treat.\n“He is one of those signings you can make where there are no question marks,” Mourinho said. “He’s not an inexperienced young guy coming to a new country. He’s a very consistent player with five years in the Premier League behind him. You can trust him to perform.”\nThe noises coming out of Chelsea at the moment suggest someone at the club thought differently. Should Matic perform through the season as impressively as he started on Sunday there will be a certain amount of embarrassment at Stamford Bridge and a few questions to be answered.\nMost of the faults now being listed as reasons why his sale to United made good sense – it has been hinted that he is insufficiently mobile, ponderous on the ball and tactically inflexible – will strike Mourinho as positive recommendations. He knew precisely what he was getting, a disciplined performer who plays an uncomplicated yet effective game, one who has won two Premier League titles in the past three years and probably still has enough in the tank for more. As an added bonus, Matic is a muscular 6ft 3in, perfect for the physically imposing side Mourinho seems to be putting together at Old Trafford.\nChelsea still have N’Golo Kanté, and Bakayoko when he regains fitness, yet their hierarchy still seem to be struggling to come to terms with giving Mourinho exactly what he wanted. While every club has a duty to move out players to make way for younger or classier replacements, it is not yet clear that is what has happened at Chelsea.\nMatic would seem to most eyes to have plenty of shelf life left, and the possibility remains that Chelsea have not only strengthened a direct rival but weakened themselves.\nThey deserve to have all their best players fit and available before being properly judged, but they made a sloppy, inauspicious start and now have suspensions as well as injuries to deal with. Some are blaming Conte for a lack of leadership, others suggest Roman Abramovich could be more proactive, and the absence of clarity over who is making the decisions and why does not augur well for a successful title defence.\nConte’s great achievement last season was to simplify things. He took over a team with problems and found a solution everyone understood. Now it seems the problems are back and the future foggier than ever. Conte has even admitted as much. Over at United, on the other hand, the clouds are lifting. The consensus is that Mourinho now has a team capable of playing in the way he wants to play. A big, powerful yet graceful one. Chelsea need to keep an eye on that, because to a large extent they have been facilitators.\n"

        "text": "\nManchester United want to tempt João Mário away from Internazionale and are so keen on the Portuguese midfielder that they will offer his Italian employers Juan Mata in exchange. According to the Corriere dello Sport, however, “the Spaniard isn’t particularly keen”, while Inter “would absolutely be ready to take a seat at the negotiating table if Henrikh Mkhitaryan was part of the discussions”. Apparently Inter feel Mário’s performances have not justified the €40m (plus potential €5m in assorted bonuses and add-ons) they spent to lure him away from Sporting in 2016 but they also feel it would be a bit embarrassing to sell him at a significant loss. Therefore they have hit upon the cunning ruse of swapping him for someone else, thereby putting no particular monetary value on the deal whatsoever. Paris Saint-Germain are apparently also interested, with Javier Pastore potentially making the reverse move.\nJonny Evans has some decisions to make. West Bromwich Albion want their 29-year-old centre-back to sign a new contract and stay at the Hawthorns but Manchester City plan to recommence their pursuit of the former Manchester United man in January while a couple of other clubs – Everton and West Ham, to be precise – hope to pip Pep should the defender become available. West Brom, meanwhile, are also thinking about their forward line and have sent scouts to Belgrade for the Europa League match between Red Star and Koln, to cast their eyes over Richmond Boakye, who has scored 10 goals in 11 league games this season and has already caught the attention of Chelsea.\n\n\n\n\nManchester City’s winning run ends as makeshift side fall to Shakhtar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA group of Real Madrid players including Marco Asensio and Isco have a WhatsApp group where they discuss matters football, and according to Diario Gol have been remarking in particular upon Cristiano Ronaldo’s selfishness and laziness. “In this group they complain that Cristiano only runs when it benefits him, that he does not give his all on the field and that he is focused only on his own interests, not those of the team,” they report. Perhaps uncoincidentally, they report elsewhere that the Portuguese star’s position in the squad is “no longer untouchable” and that the club are readying a move for Chelsea’s Eden Hazard, who was phoned by Zinedine Zidane last week for an entirely-coincidental-honest-guv friendly chat.\nCould Celtic finally be ready to sell Moussa Dembélé? Brighton certainly hope so, and are “considering testing the water with an offer of £20m” for the French forward in January, writes the Mail. Meanwhile, the Sun reports that “Arda Turan has been snapped in London as serious doubts remain over his Barcelona future”, though this was not exactly a clandestine mission, the snaps having been uploaded to Twitter by Turan himself. Still, it might mean something. Meanwhile, Sunderland want Bolton’s Gary Madine and in the first drips of what may become a deluge of Everton-based rumour Sam Allardyce apparently wants to sign Steven Nzonzi from Sevilla and, more ambitiously, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang from Borussia Dortmund.\nArsène Wenger has ruled out the possibility of allowing significant departures in January, even though players such as Theo Walcott, Olivier Giroud and Jack Wilshere are all liable to be feeling a bit miffed about the number of matches they are not starting and wondering if someone somewhere might show them a little more love. “I want to keep the squad,” Wenger said. “We do not want to become weaker. I have to consider the interest of the player but [more important] will be the interests of the club.” Spoilsport.\n"

        "text": "\nIt was the cartoon, published on the Daily Telegraph website a few years ago, that probably demonstrated the perception at the time that the man in charge of Manchester United’s transfer business was straying dangerously close to getting the reputation of being a bit of a pushover.\nEntitled “Manchester United and the Transfer Market” and published shortly after the arrival of Ángel Di María and Radamel Falcao, the cartoon showed the club’s executive vice‑chairman, Ed Woodward, walking into a convenience store called Costless and asking to be shown the “very finest” chocolate they had for sale before handing over £80 for a Mars Bar.\nHe returned to the same store a while later and the shopkeeper, sensing another easy kill, offered him a packet of wine gums for £100. Woodward offered the “far more realistic price of £95” and they started haggling.\nShopkeeper: “£98.” Woodward: “£99.” Shopkeeper: “£110.” Woodward: “£100.” Shopkeeper: “Deal!” Woodward (triumphantly): “Still got it …”\nIt’s an easy laugh. Yet it’s not entirely fair to portray Woodward as a soft touch and, if we think back to his first transfer window in the role, he never really got the credit he deserved for the way he faced down Wayne Rooney and refused, point-blank, to bend to the requirements of Chelsea and Roman Abramovich.\nChelsea, you might recall, had lodged two bids for Rooney after José Mourinho’s return to Stamford Bridge in the summer of 2013. The player was doing all he could to make the move happen and Mourinho was under the impression it was only a matter of time. Yet Woodward held firm. Bending to player power, he concluded, would be weak in the extreme. It wasn’t a question of money. It was a case of self-preservation, assessing the dangers and looking after his own club’s reputation. Chelsea’s £50m signing of Fernando Torres from Liverpool was seen throughout the sport as a shift in dynamic between the two clubs. Woodward decided his position was irreversible and that he could not risk United going the same way.\n\n\n\n\nManchester United rout Swansea City as Romelu Lukaku sparks late burst\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost people would conclude that was the right decision when Rooney, at 27, was still capable of scoring 20 goals a season for the next three years. Yet it is also fair to say Woodward was under considerable pressure to change his mind. Rooney went to see him, making it clear he wanted to go, but it made no difference. And of course it was the sensible thing to do when the alternative, as Chelsea might yet find out with Nemanja Matic, risks a scenario where the selling club see a former player lift the Premier League trophy in another team’s ribbons.\nChelsea evidently thought they could take that risk, bearing in mind their favourable reaction when Mourinho, now their former manager, identified Matic as an ideal wearer of United’s colours and found out that his former club were happy to do business with his current one. Matic has fitted in seamlessly to his new team, immediately giving the impression his contribution to United’s season is going to be considerable, and it is easy to understand why throughout the sport there is an element of mystery why a club with Chelsea’s ambitions have been so obliging.\nTo put it into context, perhaps the best place to start is an interview last February in which Mourinho was asked whether it was possible in the Premier League for the top clubs to sign players from their leading rivals. “This is not Germany,” he pointed out. “In Germany, Bayern Munich starts winning the league in the summer. They go to Borussia Dortmund every year and buy their best player. One day they go there and [Robert] Lewandowski. The next year, they go there, Mario Götze. The next year, Mats Hummels.\n“Do you think I can go to Tottenham Hotspur and bring two Tottenham players to kill Tottenham? I can’t. I cannot go to Arsenal and bring the two best Arsenal players. I cannot go to Chelsea and bring two of the players that I love very, very much. That time is over. That time of attacking your direct opponents in the country is over. You cannot attack your rivals that way any more.”\nIt turned out he was wrong, or at least partly wrong, given that one of his favourites from Chelsea is now exerting his influence in a red shirt. Mourinho seems as surprised as anyone and there may come a time when Chelsea have to concede that maybe Woodward had the right idea. Why help out the team that could be going head to head against you for the title? Why facilitate a club who would never dream of being so generous in return? And how much will the £40m transfer fee matter to a man of Abramovich’s wealth if Matic’s contribution for his new team helps to return the championship trophy to Old Trafford?\nArsenal were guilty of an even more reckless form of business when they allowed Robin van Persie to move to Old Trafford in 2012 and handed over a player who had just won the Professional Footballers’ Association Player of the Year award. They seemed quite happy with the money they received for the player – £22.5m, initially – but not so much when he scored 35 times the following season and Sir Alex Ferguson’s team won the league with four games to spare. For that, Arsenal received a £1.5m top-up payment. Who would you imagine was the happier?\nUnited made a calculated risk of their own when Danny Welbeck went the other way during the Louis van Gaal era. Yet Welbeck was not a performer with Van Persie’s intuitive brilliance and there have been only a few other occasions – Mickaël Silvestre to Arsenal and Juan Sebastian Verón to Chelsea, being the notable ones – when the modern United have broken away from their position that it makes absolutely no sense to solve your rivals’ problems.\n\n\n\n\nJosé Mourinho: Chelsea are title favourites with no excuses for failure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnited even brought in lawyers in 2007 to prevent Gabriel Heinze from moving to Liverpool. Heinze had a written agreement that he could leave Old Trafford if a potential buyer offered £6m. He ended up employing Liverpool’s solicitors to act for him against his own club – an incredible story of politics, rivalry and legal manoeuvring – but it got him nowhere and Phil Chisnall remains the last player, in April 1964, to move from one club to the other, in the same week that BBC2 was flickering on to the nation’s black-and-white televisions for the first time.\nThe strange thing, perhaps, is that some of the other clubs with realistic aspirations of going for the title are nothing like as particular about who they do business with. Spurs, for one, have regularly pained their own supporters that way and Arsenal, similarly, have spent a number of years helping the Manchester clubs assemble title-winning sides.\nFor the reigning champions to risk the same, however, doesn’t make obvious sense. Matic might not have been an automatic starter after Tiémoué Bakayoko’s arrival from Monaco but the Serb has gone straight into United’s midfield and, at 29, could feasibly stay there for the next four years. It defies logic and the popular theory, namely that Abramovich apparently ticked off the deal after a personal request from the player, doesn’t make it any less perplexing. Very decent of him, you might think, but if the question is whether United would do the same in return then Rooney can probably provide the answer.\nCosta blank when it comes to blame\nIt shouldn’t be a great surprise, if you have followed the pattern of Diego Costa’s career, that this is not the first time he has failed to report for duty after a summer of self-indulgence.\nCosta was so out of shape when he turned up late for pre-season training one year at Atlético Madrid one of the journalists who covers the club, José David Palacio, recalls the player trying to strike a deal with the local media. “He tried to avoid the cameras as much as possible and insisted that we didn’t film his whole body,” Palacio says.\nCosta had been awol for the first four days of training and was made to issue a public apology in which he initially blamed his mother’s cooking. “It was just a breakdown in communication. I lost my Spanish mobile and didn’t realise that the club don’t have my Brazilian number. Otherwise they could have called me on that. But I came back the minute they called and I’m really sorry this happened. Something seems to go wrong every year. Problems seem to seek me out.”\nHe is right. Problems do seek him out. Yet Costa seems to labour under the misapprehension that it is merely misfortune and, in that regard, one imagines it will be a considerable relief for Chelsea when they have finally removed one of the more tiring characters in the business from their payroll.\nFA’s odd omission in Aluko inquiry \nThe FA’s decision to publish the barrister’s report relevant to the Eni Aluko “hush money” case detailed why the governing body had not upheld her complaints about an alleged racial remark and ruled there had been no wrongdoing by the England women’s team manager, Mark Sampson.\nWhat it did not address was the well‑sourced claim that the mixed‑race player he was said to have left “distressed” during the China Cup in 2015 – Sampson was alleged to have asked her how many times she had been in trouble with the police – was not among the people to be interviewed in the wake of Aluko’s varied complaints.\nIt feels bizarre, yet there have been no denials from the FA. Can it really be true? Can there really have been an allegation of that nature and an investigation took place without actually speaking to the player in question?\n"

        "text": "\nNo wonder this was the hottest ticket in town; this was a night the red half of Bristol will simply never forget. As the final whistle blew, a sea of Bristol City supporters stormed the pitch while manager Lee Johnson was still recovering after hurtling down the touchline, catching a delirious ballboy in mid-flight before swinging him around his hips, by which time the celebrations were already well under way. Bristol City had deservedly dispatched Manchester United for the first time since 1978, with a brilliant 93rd-minute winner teeing up a date with Manchester City in the Carabao Cup semi-finals.\nKorey Smith, the matchwinner who crashed home with only seconds remaining, was mobbed before leaving the pitch “like John Wayne”, according to Johnson while Joe Bryan, the Bristolian and academy graduate, who opened the scoring in equally emphatic style, was carried towards the dressing room. Johnson had urged his players to make themselves heroes but they did that and more, etching their names into history after felling the holders in the sweetest manner imaginable. In doing so, the Championship side have now beaten four Premier League opponents this season, more than both Swansea City and West Bromwich Albion. Another fearless performance like this and they might make that five.\n\n\n\n\nLee Johnson hails ‘special group’ after Bristol City beat Manchester United\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis was always going to be a special occasion, under the lights inside at a sold-out – revamped and rocking – Ashton Gate as the Robins duelled with United for the first time since 1980. The ambition here is to make these meetings a more regular occurrence, with City third in the second tier and vying for promotion. José Mourinho stuck to his word by naming a strong team here although David de Gea and Nemanja Matic did not travel to the West Country. Luke Shaw, however, made his first start since April.\nIt was Smith – a £350,000 signing from Oldham Athletic – and City’s one change, the incoming former United goalkeeper Luke Steele, who made the greatest impression, with the latter twice superbly denying the substitute Romelu Lukaku. Smith’s opposite number Sergio Romero, though, was kept more busy during a frenetic first half of action, with Josh Brownhill’s dipping drive forcing him to punch clear early on while defender Hordur Magnusson also went close.\nUnited, though largely underwhelming, twice struck the woodwork inside 21 minutes, through the returning Zlatan Ibrahimovic and then Marcus Rashford. Ibrahimovic then skewed a volley horribly wide and into the rebuilt South Stand. When Smith drove into the box he almost laid the ball on a plate for Bobby Reid only for Daley Blind to pour cold water on the move, intercepting just as the forward looked to pull the trigger.\nAden Flint, who has a knack for coming up with the goods having scored six times already from centre-back this season, did put the ball in the net when poking home after blocking Romero’s goal-kick but the referee, Mike Dean, intervened with the defender already wheeling away. It caused a kerfuffle on the touchline, too, with Mourinho’s assistant, Rui Faria, and Bristol City assistant coach Dean Holden briefly exchanging words.\nAfter the interval, a couple of quickfire late challenges on Paul Pogba and then Anthony Martial presented the visitors with the chance to test Steele. Test him they did, with the City goalkeeper diving low to his right to clear Rashford’s effort. Then City flew forward, with Reid flashing a shot into the side-netting after eluding Victor Lindelof.\nCity’s next move left a significant mark, though. Reid played a fine through ball into Bryan, who raced down the left before blasting the ball across Romero and into the corner of the net. United, as poor as they had been, were shell-shocked while the home dugout exploded to life as Johnson, Holden, assistant coach Jamie McAllister, kit man Scott Murray and goalkeeping coach David Coles celebrated wildly in an impromptu mosh pit.\n\n\n\n\nChelsea leave it late but Álvaro Morata finally sinks Bournemouth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAshton Gate was bouncing, but the joy was short-lived. Six minutes later, Pogba ran in to blockade of red shirts, winning a soft free-kick out of the midfielder Smith. Ibrahimovic stood over it before hammering it low around the wall and past Steele, who seemed to be caught unsighted. Ibrahimovic simply wagged his finger in celebration.\nThen came Lukaku in place of Blind but it was Bryan who found the next opening, his tame right-footed effort being easily gathered by Romero after he had read Reid’s nutmeg. Mourinho then introduced Mkhitaryan – but in place of Ibrahimovic – while City went for broke, summoning the former Bristol Rovers striker Matty Taylor in place of Magnusson.\nCity surrendered control in search for a winner, with Lukaku’s header forcing Steele into a superb stop while Bryan did brilliantly, as the last man, to prevent Rashford from squaring for Lukaku. But then Smith latched on to Taylor’s chipped pass to provide the most incredible of finales. The rest is now history.\n"

        "text": "\nAden Flint smiles at the realisation that Zlatan Ibrahimovic had not long collected another league title for Juventus when the Bristol City defender swapped Pinxton for Alfreton Town in a move that saw him lay the groundwork for the roads he was driving on as well as a career in professional football.\n“I started tarmacking when I was playing at Alfreton,” explains Flint. “I was doing stupid hours, plus going to a Tuesday and a Saturday game. One time I was working on the roads in the day in Nottingham, played a game at Alfreton on the evening and then drove to Grimsby for a nightshift, to tarmac. I got back at five in the morning. It was ridiculous. I don’t know how I did it, to be honest. It makes me tired just thinking about it now.”\n\n\n\n\nBristol City ride wave of emotion but Birmingham hit rock bottom\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThankfully those long days wearing a high-visibility jacket are consigned to the past and the 28-year-old can take satisfaction from the fact that he stands out for rather different reasons now, not least his reputation as one of the most prolific defenders in the Football League. Flint has six goals this season – averaging one every three appearances in the Championship – and has scored 35 times since signing for Bristol City four years ago, including a hat-trick.\nIt is a remarkable return for a centre-half and represents one of the biggest threats to Manchester United in Wednesday night’s Carabao Cup quarter-final at Ashton Gate, where Flint is relishing the chance to face the club he grew up supporting and a team who have conceded three times from set pieces in their past two matches.\n“I go up for a corner or a set piece and I’m not going to lie, I’m angry when the ball doesn’t come near me because I think if you put it near me, there’s a good chance I’m going to head it, and the majority of the time it either goes in the back of the net or it gets us a chance,” Flint says. “And when I say I’m angry when it doesn’t come near me, I actually start swearing at people when they don’t deliver it in the right place, that’s how much it frustrates me. But that’s how much I want to help the team as well.”\nWhat you see is what you get with the 28-year-old Flint, who is 6ft 6in – marginally taller than Ibrahimovic – and plays with great enthusiasm, endearing him to supporters. A late entrant into the full-time game, he knows a thing or two about grafting as well as playing football at the lower end of the pyramid, where pints are almost as important as points.\n“Pinxton [in Derbyshire] is my hometown village and about eight levels below the Conference North,” he says. “That was basically pub football before Alfreton. I did that from leaving school, played there for five months and then went to Alfreton, had a couple of years there, went to Swindon and then here. I’ve been making up for lost time. I came into it late and I want to play as long as I can and get as many games as I can – on Saturday it was my 300th career start, which is a nice milestone, but I want to add to that.”\nThat landmark coincided with a fourth successive Championship victory for Bristol City, who are third in the table and enjoying an excellent season. Lee Johnson’s side have knocked out three Premier League teams to reach the last eight of the League Cup and the excitement around the club is almost tangible. All 26,200 tickets have been sold for the United game, which means that Ashton Gate will host its biggest crowd since £45m was spent redeveloping the ground.\n“When I came the stadium was old and now it is state-of-the-art,” says Flint. “It shows the ambition that the chairman has got and what everyone at the club wants – they’ve got a vision and we’re building towards being at the top and being in the Premier League, and that’s what we all want. The team is fantastic, it’s got unbelievable spirit, but alongside that you’ve got some ridiculously talented players to go with it, and I think that’s a great blend and that’s why we’re doing so well.”\n\n\n\n\nAden Flint’s late strike helps Bristol City pull away from Sheffield United\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohnson, City’s head coach, joked that Flint must be “trying to get a move” when he heard that the defender had mentioned he was a United fan, although it turns out that he was a genuine supporter back in the day. Flint’s father followed them home and away and son was quickly hooked. “The Treble-winning season really meant something to me – you look at that team they had then: Beckham, Keane, Scholes, Giggs, Schmeichel, Yorke, Cole – ridiculous,” Flint says. “I wish I was playing against them – that would be the icing on the cake.”\nFor now, however, Flint is more than happy to settle for taking on Ibrahimovic – “Zlatan’s a footballing icon,” he says – and looking forward to trying to get on the end of one of those dead-ball deliveries that make his eyes light up. “There’s no point going up there just for the sake of it,” Flint adds. “Every time I want to put it in the back of the net, because there’s not a better feeling than running off celebrating.”\nCity won’t be lacking bottle\nJosé Mourinho’s time comes at a cost and Bristol City are more than happy to pay what it takes to keep the Manchester United manager on the premises after Wednesday night’s Carabao Cup quarter-final, even if it means parting with £450 for a bottle of red wine to “seduce” him into the head coach’s office.\nLee Johnson, Mourinho’s opposite number, revealed that he had left no stone unturned to ensure that the Portuguese is discouraged from making a sharp exit at Ashton Gate, right down to identifying the correct person to pour the bottle of Barca Velha 2004 that has set him back a small fortune.\nAsked whether he anticipated spending a bit of time with Mourinho after the game, Johnson replied: “Well, I hope so. I spent £450 on a bottle of wine. I had to raid my little girl’s piggy bank. This bottle of wine is being specially flown in from Portugal. We’ve done the due diligence and realised that José likes this particular bottle that has to be poured specially by an expert. So hopefully he’ll come in and have a little chat with me and I’ll try to pick his brain for five or 10 minutes, or as long as it takes to drink the wine.\n“I’ve been obsessed about making sure that we get this correct bottle of wine to seduce him into the office. We finally found it – it’s a bottle of Barca Velha Red 2004, £450. Maybe I’ll try and get a loan or two out of it.”\n"

Talks between United and Chelsea over a fee have taken some time, with the clubs initially substantially apart over the price.\nChelsea had set their sights on receiving £50m and it is not yet clear what the fee will be for the 28-year-old. They were particularly keen to drive a hard bargain with United after missing out to them over the signing of Romelu Lukaku.\nMatic’s Stamford Bridge exit had long been expected after the Chelsea manager Antonio Conte signed the France international Tiemoue Bakayoko from Monaco in £39.7m deal this month.\nA picture circulated on Twitter purporting to show Matic in United training kit and wearing No31, which has been vacant since the departure of Bastian Schweinsteiger. Chelsea had left Matic out of their tour to Asia to allow him to finalise a move. Next on Juventus’s list of midfield targets are Paris Saint-Germain’s Blase Matuidi and Sevilla’s Steven N’Zonzi.\nMatic would be United’s third signing of the summer following a £31m deal for the defender Victor Lindelof and the £75m move for Lukaku from Everton. Matic could make his debut against Sampdoria in Dublin on Wednesday or in the Uefa Super Cup against Real Madrid next week. Mourinho told MUTV: “I’m waiting for news. I know that he wants that very, very much and when a player wants very, very much the chance is bigger … so I think we have a chance but in football until it’s official, I saw so many things happen that I refuse to say more than I am telling you now.”\nMatic was a key component of Chelsea’s title-winning team in 2014-15 after Mourinho brought him back to the club from Benfica for £20.75m.\nUnited have also been linked with a winger and are keen on Ivan Perisic. Internazionale’s £49m asking price, however, has proved a substantial stumbling block.\nPerisic fits Mourinho’s requirements but the United manager may now be forced to look elsewhere for an attacking solution, with the club reportedly also interested in Everton’s Ross Barkley.\nMourinho, speaking after a 3-0 friendly victory against Valerenga in Oslo on Sunday , appeared to end Galatasaray’s hopes of signing Marouane Fellaini. The Turkish club were sufficiently confident of getting the midfielder that they had made plans for their president, Dursun Ozbek, or another board member to come to Manchester on Monday or Tuesday.\nAn agreement has been reached in principle with the 29-year-old Fellaini over a four‑year contract worth in the region of €4m (£3.6m), which would make him their highest-paid player.\nHowever, Mourinho said after Fellaini scored against Valerenga: “It’s easier for Galatasaray to get me than Marouane. If they need a manager, they can try and have a chance, but Marouane? Forget it. He’s too important for me.”\n• You can follow David Hytner, Fabrizio Romano and Emre Sarigul on Twitter\n"

Neither José Mourinho nor his players could take much pride in finishing second if it turns out Pep Guardiola and City are streets ahead in first. United are actually on a decent run of their own, with only one defeat in seven league games since they lost at Chelsea on Bonfire night, though there are no prizes for guessing the identity of the side that inflicted the most recent wound.\nUnited keep coming second-best to their neighbours and even though this victory narrowed the gap to 11 points rather than 14 at the top, that is still rather an ominous gap before the halfway point of the season has been reached. United have a perfectly respectable number of points for this stage of the season but City have already passed the half‑century. United have scored 39 goals, at an average better than two a game, yet City are averaging better than three.\nWhile there have been signs that Mourinho realises he is in a fight he cannot win, at least this was a fighting performance from his players. West Bromwich Albion are not exactly daunting opponents, they are in the bottom three and their first goal in four matches under their new manager came as a result of an untidy goalmouth scramble when United thought they were coasting to victory, yet they did their best to make life hard for their visitors. For the first half hour they presented United with two solid lines of defence, usually compact in their own half, with only Salomón Rondón offering a notional outlet up front. United will have seen similar set-ups before and they probably relished the challenge of coming up against a parked bus as a break from positioning the vehicle themselves.\nThe obvious flaw in such a basic gameplan is that it is difficult to respond if the opposition find a way through. City demonstrated that against United, and Mourinho’s players were sufficiently superior here to take a patient approach against Albion. For perhaps a quarter of the game there was a question of whether a midfield lacking Paul Pogba would be creative or forceful enough to break through the home barriers, and during that period, with Romelu Lukaku lumbering around in search of a pass or a useful opening, it was easy to make unflattering comparisons between United’s old-fashioned centre‑forward approach and City’s more fluent front-line.\nThen Marcus Rashford pulled the ball on to his right foot to cross from the left and in an instant Lukaku was transformed from over-priced passenger to deadly finisher as a perfectly placed header flashed into Ben Foster’s top corner. Lukaku may not be everyone’s idea of a £75m striker but there must be a reason why Chelsea and United were fighting for his services over the summer, and given a glimpse of a chance to win this match he took it, no problem.\nWest Bromwich were never likely to come back from going behind, given how deep they had been operating, and before they reached the interval and a chance to reorganise they had conceded again when Ahmed Hegazi’s deflection helped Jesse Lingard’s shot beat Foster. There could have been more from United, with Rashford showing up particularly well before he was substituted, yet there were also one or two nervous moments after Gareth Barry’s scrappy goal brought Albion back into the game.\nSo much so that Nemanja Matic ended up with a caution for time-wasting, while the home fans amused themselves with a few cheeky renditions of “Park the bus, park the bus, Man Utd”. Mourinho and his players will probably have to get used to that.\nThe title race may be all-but over, but everybody other than City could be in for a long and trying run-in.\n"

        "text": "\nJosé Mourinho has compared Manchester United’s struggle in the Champions League to having “a giant on our chest” before their return to the competition.\nUnited lost Tuesday’s Uefa Super Cup 2-1 to Real Madrid, who have won the European Cup for the past two seasons, the first club to do so in the Champions League era. United will enter at the group stage of the tournament when it starts next month.\nWhen on the summer tour of the US Mourinho was clear his side were not in the class of Real and Barcelona, after losing to the latter and managing only a penalty shootout win against the former in friendly matches.\nUnited won last season’s Europa League but Mourinho admits it is a challenge to try to catch Real, Barça and other continental heavyweights. He said: “Manchester United are one of the top three football clubs in the world, no doubt about it, but the football club is one thing and the team’s credentials going into a competition are another thing entirely. We have a giant on our chest, which is really heavy, but we don’t compare our potential to the biggest clubs in Europe right now.\n“We’ll take it step by step and be humble. The first step is to try to finish in the top three. If we manage that, we’ll try to finish in the top two. Then, when you’re in the Champions League last 16 draw, anything can happen.”\nDespite Forbes naming United in June as the world’s richest club, worth $3.69bn (£2.79bn), Mourinho claimed other teams have the finance to compete, again making his task harder.\n\n\n\n\nUgly but effective: Marouane Fellaini proves his worth to Mourinho again\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Because Manchester United is a real giant, it doesn’t matter if the club is somewhat far away from that level for three, four, five or 10 years. It doesn’t matter: the club will always be a giant. But our job is to try to bring the football club back to that stature. That’s really difficult these days,” he said.\n“Before, the giants were the powerful ones economically, and now there are small clubs in terms of prestige and history, who are giants economically. That changes absolutely everything. I want the team to be on a par with the club’s history, which is something I’ve been lucky enough to feel at every club – there was the same kind of feeling at Inter and at Real Madrid.\n“We are going to do that, step by step. Last season we won trophies. Playing against the European champions [on Tuesday], it’s like we’re back at the theatre, back at that level. This is where we want to be. We’ll improve the team and try to be at that level, to constantly be improving. And I think we’re going to reach that level as a football team in the next couple of years.”\nMourinho also stated contentment with Paul Pogba. “I’m more than happy [with him] I’m really happy. He was amazing in the [Europa League] final,” said the manager, the Frenchman having scored the opener in the 2-0 win over Ajax. “I’m totally convinced this season will be even better for him, and that playing in the Champions League against the best teams and players will take some pressure off him, because in the Europa League, he was obviously one of the two or three biggest stars.”\n"

        "text": "\nAbout 10 minutes before half-time, the plea went up around Old Trafford: “Attack! Attack! Attack!” It’s a chant that dates back to the 1960s. It was heard, for instance, at Wembley in 1968 when Manchester United beat Benfica to win the European Cup as fans revelled in the refusal of Matt Busby’s side to rest on a 1-0 lead even in a game so freighted with emotion and importance. By Louis van Gaal’s time, the chant had taken on a different tone: something between mockery of an approach based on risk-free possession and a demand for something more uplifting. It’s hard to interpret this latest outbreak as being anything other than a complaint.\n\n\n\n\nJosé Mourinho in post-match fracas over Manchester City’s ‘noisy’ celebrations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJosé Mourinho was always going to have his side sit deep. That’s just how he plays in big games and the evidence of City’s last three league games – and particularly Pep Guardiola’s evident frustration at the approach – was that City don’t find it easy against teams who set out with few ambitions but to deny them space. This City pose challenges few other teams have ever posed: Mourinho’s approach was both predictable and, up to a point, understandable. But only up to a point.\nThat he began with Marcus Rashford, Jesse Lingard and Anthony Martial behind Romelu Lukaku was misleading. Four forwards looks positive, but he did that at Internazionale as well, when he would field Goran Pandev, Wesley Sneijder and Samuel Eto’o behind Diego Milito and, in big games, watch them defend with great discipline. Mourinho’s greatest gift, perhaps, is his capacity to persuade forwards to defend. That, and the management of expectations.\nUnited’s front four did defend: clumsily and, as it turned out, counterproductively in the case of Lukaku, efficiently and diligently in the case of the wide men tracking the full-backs. At half-time, City had had 75% of the ball and United only three shots.\nLittle wonder, then, that some home fans became a little restive as they watched a string of long punts aimed in the vague direction of Lukaku, or at least the half of the pitch in which he was mournfully loping. Reactive football is, after all, as the great Russian writer Lev Filatov put it, justifying Krylya Sovetov’s use of a proto-catenaccio in the early 50s, the “right of the weak”. But United are not weak; they are the richest club in the world. Playing like that sits uncomfortably with their self-image. What may work at Chelsea or Porto or even Inter, where reactivity can be accepted as necessary to take on the establishment, doesn’t work when you are the establishment, as United are, as Real Madrid are.\nUnited had played like this against Tottenham, waiting for a mistake that did eventually come. They had played like this at Liverpool, waiting for a mistake that never came. Here, there were mistakes and they served to highlight how many more there might have been had United just applied a little more pressure a little earlier in the game. City, having dominated, became oddly sloppy in the five minutes before half-time. Their opening goal came just after a couple of uncharacteristic misplaced passes, as though they had mesmerised themselves with their possession. Three mistakes in dealing with one simple cross led to the equaliser. At no stage did City seem comfortable dealing with direct balls.\nNicolás Otamendi had one of his shaky days. Fabian Delph for once looked like a midfielder playing at the back, as did Fernandinho for the quarter of an hour he did so before being rescued by the introduction of Eliaquim Mangala. Lukaku and Rashford had chances even before the Ederson double save. With five minutes to go, City were rattled enough to take the ball into the corners, despite their manager’s oft-expressed ideological commitment to attacking football.\nCity were vulnerable and United, just as against Liverpool, not only did not take advantage but did not seek to take advantage. There is a line between reactivity and passivity and in the first half United were on the wrong side of it. When Mourinho did finally have a go, it was two hours too late and he was complaining about the volume of the music in the visitors’ dressing room. United are not, to use the metaphor Mourinho himself deployed in his first season back at Chelsea to pre-empt and explain the failure of a nascent title challenge, a “little horse”. They are Manchester United, the biggest, most successful team in English football, and their transfer spending is a net £250m in the two years he has been there. A team of that stature cannot be reliant on Paul Pogba – and certainly not on Marouane Fellaini.\n\n\n\n\nDavid Silva’s slow-motion grace proves far too much for Manchester United | Barney Ronay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven in the corporatised, sanitised modern Old Trafford fans expect more than that, and directors will come to. Fans, by and large, will accept any means if the ends follow. Sir Alex Ferguson was not the habitual cavalier many like to portray him as, but he won.\nResistance for now is limited but the bigger the gap at the top of the table becomes, the more stylistic questions are going to be asked: why betray tradition or self-image, romanticised as it may be, if the result is defeat? And particularly when the suspicion is that a more proactive, more palatable approach might actually have been more effective, might have exposed an opponent’s weaknesses?\nAnd this is the second season. This is supposed to be Mourinho’s golden time before third-season syndrome strikes.\n"

But reader, these are no ordinary circumstances. This is the 2017 summer transfer window, or as future historians will call it: The Beginning of the End. Now, crocked, good (sometimes very good) defenders can suffer serious injuries, sit on their backside for six months, watch their value sky-rocket, and then maybe get a lucrative move.\n\n\n\n\n‘Insulted’ Virgil van Dijk submits transfer request in bid to leave Southampton\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the world in which Virgil van Dijk lives. But enough about him, this introduction is actually meant for Tottenham’s Danny Rose, who hasn’t played a game of football since January, but according to the Independent, is fast becoming José Mourinho’s No1 target at Manchester United.\nWith deals for Ivan Perisic and Gareth Bale hitting the buffers, United are looking at more creative solutions for width going forward, and have sensibly settled on a left-back with a sometimes dodgy knee. With Rose approaching full fitness again, Daniel Levy is wary of losing his second high-profile full-back to Premier League title rivals this summer, but are reportedly willing to see how silly Ed Woodward is feeling. \nSpurs are keener to lose Moussa Sissoko, who is open to joining Turkish side Trabzonspor, according to their vice-president Gencaga Meric. “Sissoko is keen on joining, we have spoken with him and talks went well,” Meric told reporters in Turkey. “We have yet to convince Tottenham or their manager. Tottenham want to recoup most of what they invested in Sissoko but we want him on loan. We have made our offer and are waiting for a decision.”\nGiannelli Imbula has decided he’d rather spend his Tuesday nights basking in the balmy climate of the Mediterranean coast than in what-will-probably-be-wet Stoke, and has agreed a deal in principle with French champions Monaco. The problem is that the Champions League club haven’t agreed a fee: Stoke want to recoup most of the £18m they shelled out for him in January 2016, Monaco would prefer a loan deal with an option to buy. The stand-off continues. Stoke have agreed a £7.25m deal to bring loan hit Bruno Martins Indi back to the club on a permanent basis. \nLeicester City have forgotten that they have just spent £25m on Kelechi Iheanacho and will announce a £450,000 (plus add-ons) deal for 20-year-old Coventry striker George Thomas on Tuesday. \nSwansea have dipped their hand into the Arsenal bench lucky dip and come up with Carl Jenkinson. Arsenal want a permanent sale, but Swansea are thought to favour a loan deal. Fear not recently promoted clubs to the Premier League: Mathieu Debuchy, Kieran Gibbs, Calum Chambers and Jack Wilshere are still available!\nOn the continent, Bayern have gone full Bayern by attempting to lure Borussia Dortmund’s chief scout Sven Mislintat to the Allianz Arena, and Juventus are reportedly keen on Mateo Kovacic, who has been one of the best pre-season performers for Real Madrid. Nice look as though they are going to beat Celtic to the loan signing of Manchester City’s Patrick Roberts – just one day after signing Wesley Sneijder, woof! – which could clear the way for the French club’s Jean Michaël Seri to join Barcelona for €40m. \nMultiple choice round: which is true?\na) Philippe Senderos can speak six languages: English, Spanish, French, German, Italian and Serbian.b) Philippe Senderos, superstar of yesteryear is only 32 years old.c) Philippe Senderos has just signed for Houston Dynamo.\nThe answer is … all three are true!

        "text": "\nWith half an hour to go in this taut, thrilling, at times spiky Manchester derby, David Silva could be seen chugging around at the point of the Manchester City attack, not so much pressing the red-shirted defenders as rumbling between them with a stately kind of grandeur, like a royal frigate in shallow waters.\nWith Gabriel Jesus off and City leading 2-1 it was Silva, the most false of false No9s, who found himself shunted into that forward role. He has cut a more rotund, slightly more ponderous figure in the last year and a half, but remains a beautifully pure footballer. Here Silva was not only the slowest, least athletic, least physically imposing footballer on either team – he was also the best player on the pitch, so unhurried, so aware of the shifting planes and currents around him that at times he resembled a colts coach mixing in with the under-12s in training, able to peer above the heads, direct the play, call the next pass two steps ahead.\n\n\n\n\nManchester City defeat United with Otamendi strike and open 11-point gap\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a match that saw Manchester United’s own £90m centre forward Romelu Lukaku struggle – all ham-footed lay-offs and an inadvertent assist for both of City’s goals – Silva was a striking point of contrast. An oddball centre-forward perhaps, but also the compete oddball centre-forward. At one point in that second half Silva surged down the left channel, held the ball for Leroy Sané’s run and played a beautiful nudged reverse pass, a pass so gentle it seemed to belong in an altogether different game, to be startled to find itself out here surrounded by all this fury. Moments later Silva even took it on himself to make a curving, decoy run, Ian Rush-style, freeing space for Kevin De Bruyne behind him to surge forward and shoot at goal.\nIf this victory does end up a decisive step towards the league title it was entirely fitting Silva should decorate its best moments. More than any other player, and even as an inherited part, Silva embodies Pep Guardiola’s obsession with pass and move, with making a fetish of the ball, of trying to win every moment in the match.\nAnd yet Silva would perhaps struggle to find a role in the opposition here, a Manchester United team packed with speed and athleticism, but sent out at the start to defend deep and then break with speed.\nAnd what a start it was from United, who spent the opening half hour defiantly silencing their own crowd. This wasn’t just attack versus defence during those wasted opening 43 minutes, it was deep, maniacal, utterly paranoid defence. For long periods Old Trafford seemed to be staging a pub game on a windy day, the ball skirling inexorably towards the United goal, every clearance boomeranging back in the sleet.\n\n\n\n\nJosé Mourinho admits title race is all but over after Manchester City defeat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven United’s method of moving the ball forward from the back was extraordinary, something from the Wimbledon playbook under Egil Olsen, “clearing out” the midfield and sending swirling long passes towards the front three, 42 of them in the opening hour. The contrast was, of course, striking. With 20 minutes gone, Vincent Kompany varied the angle for City, skimming a long pass that flew straight through to David De Gea, while in his rectangle Guardiola went berserk, puffing out the wings of his shiny black bomber jacket as he signalled for more patience, more care, more of the same old Pep style.\nUnited were, of course, faced with a ticklish balance of attacking intentions, teased by some obvious weaknesses in City’s defence, tortured by the prospect of being torn apart by the rapiers at the other end should they overcommit to seeking out those tender spots. But this was something else, as demonstrated by the fact United scored from their first concerted attack in first-half injury time, Marcus Rashford finishing expertly after Fabian Delph had failed to cut out a diagonal pass.\n\n\n \n\n\nPlay Video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1:41\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Manchester City deserved derby win over United, says Pep Guardiola – video\n\n\nBy that stage United were already chasing the game. Later Nicolás Otamendi’s neat finish would take it away again. Fittingly, it was Silva who had scored the opener, albeit in the most unexpected way, scissoring home a loose ball after a corner. Up to that point Silva had been majestic in his more accustomed role, keeping the ball, directing City’s attacks, introducing urgency where required, and skipping away from Ander Herrera, with a decisive slow-motion grace. Some players have an extra yard in their head. Silva appears to have an entire practice pitch up there, with the whole game playing on fast-forward on a series of big screens.\nAt one point, as his legs began to slow towards the end, he could be seen calling out to Raheem Sterling and pointing, telling him where to run to take De Bruyne’s pass, trundling around the pitch like an auxiliary brain in a jar, making every part of the play he touched just that bit better; the most fitting of key parts on a day that saw City take a giant leap forward.\n"

China had seemed the most likely destination but Pep Guardiola’s preference is for America. José Mourinho is almost certain to take United to the US west coast and base the squad in Los Angeles, as he did last summer.\nOne stumbling block may be the clubs agreeing on a location to play. That was a problem last summer until it was agreed to stage the game at Houston’s NRG Stadium, which attracted 67,401 fans and ended in a 2-0 victory for United.\nMore immediate is the derby at Old Trafford on Sunday. Yaya Touré believes that if City win there and open an 11-point lead, the Premier League title race will still not be over. Touré was a member of City’s championship-winning side of 2011-12 and pointed to how they overhauled an eight-point advantage held by United.\n“I remember in 2012 when we won the league, United were first and had an eight-point lead, but we came back,” he said. “You have to be careful because the Premier League is such a tough league, you can’t relax. It will be tough in the second half of the season, especially against the sides who are fighting not to be relegated. We have to be aware of that.”\nAlthough Touré thinks United will be concerned about City, the midfielder warned that Mourinho’s team will try to hit them on the break.\n“This game can give us a lift for the future,” Touré said. “This year I think when you see United, they are going to be worried about us. That’s going to make them very dangerous on the counterattack and we have to be ready for that. Otherwise we will see the game they played against Arsenal [winning 3-1] a few days ago, so we have to be careful.\n“It’s going to be a tough game – a derby is a derby. I don’t have to explain about a derby. It’s about who wants it more.”\nCity’s 2-1 defeat at Shakhtar Donetsk in the final Champions League group game on Wednesday was their first in 227 days as Guardiola fielded a weakened XI.\n“We played against a good side,” Touré said of Ukraine’s champions. “On the counterattack, they were very good. So we need to improve. We have young players and they are still learning. It’s not easy for them because the Champions League is a tough league and Shakhtar, they needed to win.\n“Let’s see after the derby [the difference between City and United] because in football anything can happen. You just have to understand football and sometimes we can lose. We need to have a big performance on Sunday. It’s going to be difficult because the way you saw Shakhtar play, is the way United will play – counterattack, very fast and very strong. We have to be careful and, of course, we are going to train hard and try to be ready.\n“We don’t want to lose. We have to keep this kind of gap on United because now when I see United playing games against big teams, they always wait for a mistake to hit them on the counterattack.”\n"

        "text": "\nThis month Renato Sanches apologised for posting a video on social media of himself counting a huge wad of cash. It had been “tasteless” and “thoughtless”, admitted the 19-year-old midfielder after many people offered similar criticisms. The Mill isn’t going to hold that post against Sanches because the Mill did far more tasteless and thoughtless things when it was 19 and was just lucky that no one was interested enough to be watching. So the Mill is happy to give young Sanches a chance to learn and move on. And the Portuguese midfielder, rarely used by Bayern Munich, could soon have the perfect opportunity to show just how tasteful and considerable he has become, because Manchester United are thinking of lavishing yet more riches on him.\nWith Spurs still refusing to release Eric Dier, United are plotting a move for Sanches, who Bayern have made available for £40m. Milan are also interested but if the transfer to Old Trafford goes through, all Sanches has to do to show how much he has grown up is post a video of himself doing something that will amuse people rather than antagonise them. Maybe do a dance with Jesse Lingard or give José Mourinho a clip round the ear.\n\n\n\n\nLiverpool fail with £66m Naby Keïta bid as RB Leipzig owner rules out sale\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRafa Benítez reckons he can get the Republic of Ireland goalkeeper Darren Randolph to join Newcastle at a knockdown price now that West Ham have signed Joe Hart. Meanwhile, having lost Marko Arnautovic to the Hammers, Stoke plan to resume chasing Yevhen Konoplyanka, whom they first began pursuing way back when Stephen Ireland was a player. An alternative target for Stoke is Ashley Young, but he may be needed at Old Trafford just in case Sanches requires any further lectures in the pitfalls of social media.\nWatford fancy the Lyon winger Maxwel Cornet but, having already turned down a move to Spartak Moscow, the 20-year-old seems intent on staying in France for the time being.\nMeanwhile in Spain, Barcelona are planning a gigantic bid for Kylian Mbappé, both to irritate Real Madrid and to replace Neymar, who could really be on his way to Paris Saint-Germain. Barça need to keep some lolly to pay for Marco Verratti too, and the midfielder is dead-set on swapping Paris for the Camp Nou, so much so that he has hired Mino Raiola has his agent.\nLiverpool like the look of Werder Bremen’s Max Kruse, a striker who would give Jürgen Klopp an option that he does not currently have. One of these days Liverpool may also get round to completing a deal for a defender.\nWest Ham’s attempt to freshen up their squad will continue with a swoop for Jack Wilshere, for whom Arsenal are demanding £20m. Both clubs might need to have second thoughts there.\n"

        "text": "\nUnder other circumstances, the main cause for celebration would have been that Manchester United qualified for the Champions League’s knockout stages for the first time since David Moyes was a few months into his six-year contract and Marouane Fellaini was Old Trafford’s newest signing. As it was, in the lowest-profile match of a high-stakes week, sandwiched between games against Arsenal and Manchester City and when progress was all but guaranteed, the most important element could be the goal that might spur Romelu Lukaku into another scoring spree.\n“His work for the team every match is crazy,” said José Mourinho, a supportive voice during his £75m signing’s drought. “If I could choose goalscorers, I would always choose the strikers. If he can feel that happiness that strikers only get when they score goals then great.”\n\n\n\n\nWillian miss costly as Chelsea denied top spot by draw with Atlético Madrid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLukaku began his United career with 11 in 10 games. This was just his second in 13 subsequent matches and a first meaningful strike since September. It was beautifully taken and, besides a statistical significance, his equaliser should increase morale and momentum, not least his own. United were trailing, their 39-game unbeaten run at Old Trafford and 100% home record this season under threat, when Lukaku volleyed in Paul Pogba’s delightful ball.\nIf it was a reminder of how much United will miss their record signing on Sunday, when Pogba begins a three-match suspension for his red card at Arsenal, two goals in as many minutes were both fashioned by superb passes. A swift turnaround was concluded when the influential Juan Mata lofted a ball over the visitors’ defence. Marcus Rashford completed an unusual one-two by angling in the winner to earn the goal he had threatened from the off. He had struck the post in the fourth minute, springing the offside trap to meet Lukaku’s pass, and had used his pace to torment a CSKA Moscow back three with a combined age of 102 and his persistence to keep the goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev busy.\nRashford started, as Mourinho made six changes with City in mind. Even with seven players injured or rested it was notable that Henrikh Mkhitaryan was omitted altogether for the fifth time in six games. Luke Shaw, another who has felt Mourinho’s displeasure when marginalised, began for the first time in 219 days, almost scored his first career goal with a volley Akinfeev parried and drew rare praise from his manager.\n“It was a very positive performance, especially going forwards,” he added. “He was deserving of that opportunity for quite a long time and he is going to get more.” In the short term, however, demotion beckons as others return. Mourinho ruled Eric Bailly and Michael Carrick out of the derby, while adding: “Phil Jones has a chance, Fellaini a chance, Zlatan [Ibrahimovic] a big chance and [Nemanja] Matic is injured but will play for sure.”\n\n\n\n\nCeltic reach Europa League despite Simunovic gifting Anderlecht win\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheir absences meant progress was a squad achievement. “Fifteen points in a season returning to the Champions League is good,” said Mourinho. It would have taken a seven-goal defeat, which United have not suffered since 1931, plus a victory for Basel over Benfica to eliminate them. That always appeared improbable but a first home defeat since City’s last visit to Old Trafford was on the cards when CSKA led in bizarre fashion.\nVitinho’s shot went in via Alan Dzagoev’s back as United appealed for offside. Referee Gianluca Rocchi rightly ruled that Daley Blind, who had slid off the pitch in an attempt to cut out Mário Fernandes’ cross, had played Dzagoev onside. Uefa muddied the waters by crediting Vitinho with the goal but Mourinho conceded it was correctly given.\nThereafter, Sergio Romero was required to make a late save to deny Dzagoev an altogether more conventional equaliser, while Mourinho was left pondering if United’s reward for topping Group A will be a meeting with Real Madrid or Bayern Munich. “I am not the luckiest guy with draws,” he said sardonically. “It is better I shut up and forget it.”\n"

        "text": "\nIt was an occasion when Manchester United demonstrated a remorseless edge in front of goal and yet could count the goalkeeper, David de Gea, as their most influential player. And it was one in which the joy of a first Premier League away win over a big six rival under José Mourinho was undercut by a senseless red card for Paul Pogba.\nWhat a mixed bag it was for the France midfielder. He had set up Antonio Valencia’s opening goal and strutted about the Emirates as though he owned the place. But on 74 minutes he lunged at Héctor Bellerín and planted his studs into the Arsenal defender’s leg. It drew the inevitable censure and the kicker is that Pogba will be suspended for next Sunday’s Manchester derby.\n\n\n\n\nArsenal 1-3 Manchester United: Premier League – as it happened\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArsenal played a full part in a richly entertaining spectacle and they will wonder how they emerged with nothing. There were two principle reasons: the re-emergence of their defensive frailties, and De Gea. Arsenal rained 33 shots at the Spaniard’s goal, with 15 of them on target, but their only reward was Alexandre Lacazette’s close-range finish early in the second half to make it 2-1.\nAt that point, Arsenal looked set fair for the equaliser. But De Gea, who had made a string of excellent first-half saves, kept his best until last. His double stop to keep out Lacazette and Alexis Sánchez drew a sharp intake of breath. He finished with 14 saves, equalling a Premier League record. Is there even a question about his current pre-eminence in English football?\nJesse Lingard promptly added his second and United’s third on the counterattack and it was impossible to ignore the contrast in the attacking statistics. The visitors’ three goals came from four shots on target.\nArsenal had entered on a roll, their confidence pepped by the derby victory over Tottenham Hotspur and a feeling that they had located their groove – particularly on home turf. Theirs was a performance of vim and vigour but no team can offer such presents and expect to emerge unscathed.\nThe first was gift-wrapped by Laurent Koscielny. His floated cross-field pass for Sead Kolasinac was intercepted by Valencia and he moved it on to Pogba. Everyone in red was drawn to the midfielder – an illustration of the fear factor that has built around him – and, when he popped it back to Valencia, the defender had the time and space to shoot low through Petr Cech’s legs.\nUnited had scored only once in seven previous away games under Mourinho against big six clubs but here they were two up after 11 minutes. This time, Shkodran Mustafi was the Arsenal villain. Receiving possession as the last defender, he dawdled and was robbed by Lingard. The ball broke to Romelu Lukaku, who found Anthony Martial and his wonderful flick ushered in Lingard, who guided a first-time finish inside the far corner.\nTo add to their problem, Mustafi felt Lingard’s challenge and was forced off. “I don’t know what he has,” Arsène Wenger said waspishly when asked about Mustafi. “I don’t know what is wrong with him at all.”\n\n\n\n\nDavid de Gea brings greatness to bear for Manchester United amid Arsenal onslaught | Barney Ronay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWenger sent on Alex Iwobi, switched to 4-2-3-1 and almost immediately the flow of the game changed. It was a minor miracle how Arsenal did not score before the interval but De Gea refused to be beaten. Two of his first-half saves stood out. He managed to smuggle Lacazette’s close-range shot up and on to the crossbar – Granit Xhaka curled the rebound inches wide – while he pawed the ball away from the line after Sánchez’s free-kick had ricocheted off Lukaku.\nArsenal did not get the breaks but the crowd stayed with them and their belief did not drop. Eventually they got their reward when Aaron Ramsey touched back Mesut Özil’s cross and as United stopped and prayed for a flag, Lacazette shot past De Gea. Game on.\nThe outstanding Lingard hit a post on the break in the 52nd minute but it was Arsenal who looked the likelier scorer of the next goal. De Gea had other ideas. He had saved smartly from Iwobi before he threw out a hand to deny Lacazette and followed up by saving with his feet from Sánchez.\nUnited’s third was another horror show for Arsenal and, once again, Koscielny was implicated. He seemed to have Pogba under control only to be tricked and out-muscled by him on the touchline. Pogba crossed, Lingard tapped in.\nPogba would feel the red mist descend and there was still time for the referee, Andre Marriner, to wave away strong penalty appeals from the Arsenal substitute, Danny Welbeck, and Lacazette. Mourinho raged when Marriner chose only to caution Koscielny rather than dismiss him for a last-man foul on Lukaku. It was the game of the season, so far. When the dust settled, it was United who could smile.\n"

        "text": "\nManchester United have completed the purchase of Nemanja Matic from Chelsea for £40m on a three-year deal, with an option to extend for a further year.\nJosé Mourinho expressed his delight at signing the midfielder by telling United’s website: “Nemanja is a Manchester United player and a José Mourinho player. He represents everything we want in a footballer: loyalty, consistency, ambition, team player.\n\n\n\n\nTransfer window 2017 – every deal in Europe's top five leagues\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“I would like to thank him for his desire to join us because without that it would be impossible to have him here. I am sure our players and supporters will love him. A big welcome to our new No31.”\nMatic’s signing represents a significant boost to Mourinho after United failed in their efforts to purchase Eric Dier from Tottenham Hotspur. Juventus were also keen on Matic but the player, who will be 29 on Tuesday, preferred a move to Old Trafford and being reunited with Mourinho. He was a key component of Chelsea’s title-winning team in 2014-15 after being brought back to the club in January 2014. Chelsea were particularly keen to drive a hard bargain with United after missing out to them over the signing of Romelu Lukaku.\nMatic said: “I am delighted to have joined Manchester United. To work with José Mourinho once again was an opportunity I couldn’t turn down.\n\n\n\n\nNemanja Matic may be Manchester United’s most important summer signing | Jonathan Wilson\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“I have enjoyed my time at Chelsea and would like to thank the club and the fans for their support. I cannot wait to meet my new team-mates and to start training with them.This is a very exciting time for the club and I am looking forward to playing my part in creating more history for this great club.”\nMatic’s Stamford Bridge exit had long been expected after the Chelsea manager Antonio Conte signed the France international Tiemoué Bakayoko from Monaco in a £39.7m deal last month. A picture circulated on Twitter purporting to show Matic in United training kit and wearing No31, which has been vacant since the departure of Bastian Schweinsteiger. Chelsea had left Matic out of their tour to Asia to allow him to finalise a move.\nHe becomes United’s third signing of the summer following a £31m deal for the defender Victor Lindelof and the £75m move for Lukaku from Everton. The Serbian could make his debut against Sampdoria in Dublin on Wednesday or in the Uefa Super Cup against Real Madrid next week.\nMatic was a key component of Chelsea’s title-winning team in 2014-15 after Mourinho brought him back to the club from Benfica for £20.75m.\n"

After yesterday’s act of gross insubordination, in which the Rumour Mill poured scorn on the futility and utter pointlessness of its own existence, here we are at the start of another week, surveying the football landscape to see what’s being reported in the wide and crazy world of feverish football transfer speculation.\nThe Mirror reports that Ross Barkley will have to take a pay cut if he is to leave Everton for Tottenham as his suitors aren’t prepared to give him the £120,000 per week stipend he’s asking for to move to north London. Were Spurs to acquiesce to Barkley’s demands, he would become the highest paid player at a club where even Harry Kane is forced to try to make ends meet on weekly pay of £100,000, a sum that barely amounts to the London living wage.\n\n\n\n\nArsène Wenger: Mesut Özil standoff could work in Arsenal’s favour\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter winning their first trophy of the season with a 2-1 defeat at the hands of Sevilla and their 100% record, things got increasingly weird at Arsenal when Arsène Wenger spoke of how “ideal” it is that Mesut Özil has only a year left on his contract and is in a stand-off with the club. Reports from Spain suggest Barcelona could make a move for the German if they are unsuccessful in their attempts to prise Philippe Coutinho from Anfield for £85m.\nAlexis Sánchez, meanwhile, is still recuperating from his man-flu in Chile but expected to return on Monday night with speculation rife on the Manchester City training ground that he’ll soon be pitching up there for rondos. The Manchester Evening News reports that there is “anticipation within the City squad that the Chile international will head to the Etihad”. Sky Sports say Sánchez may pass the time on his flight back to Blighty inking a transfer request to present to the Arsenal hierarchy upon his return. In other Arsenal news, Kieran Gibbs may also leave the Emirates, having caught the eye of Watford manager Marco Silva.\nReports from France suggest Paris Saint-Germain right-back Serge Aurier is off to Manchester United, having been deemed surplus to requirements by Unai Emery. Sky’s fabled “sources” also say Manchester United have agreed a £40m fee with Chelsea for Serbian midfielder Nemanja Matic and are confident of sounding the “done deal” klaxon in the coming days.\nHaving rejected Roma bids of £20m and £32m for Riyad Mahrez, Leicester City bean-counters are staging an office sweep to see what random number the Italians will come up with next. That old adage about God never closing a door without opening a window is likely to be proved true when Manchester City striker Kelechi Iheanacho finally rocks up at the King Power Stadium. Meanwhile at West Brom, Tony Pulis wants Thomas Vermaelen to swap like for like and move from Camp Nou to the Hawthorns.\nDespite the wealth of talent in their own youth set-up, Chelsea are hell bent on taking 19-year-old Bayern Munich midfielder Renato Sanches to Stamford Bridge on a season-long loan and will pay whatever it takes to get him there. The Star reports that Sanches may choose to go to Milan instead, because he’s worried the presence of Tiemoué Bakayoko at Chelsea would mean he’ll spend too much time kicking his heels on the bench. Back in London following their money-spinning tour of Asia, Chelsea’s players will be given a few days off prior to next weekend’s Community Shield match against Arsenal.\n\n\n\n\nManchester United poised to complete Nemanja Matic signing from Chelsea\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMidfielder Darron Gibson is almost certainly bracing himself for an awkward conversation with Sunderland manager Simon Grayson, having been filmed by fans disparaging his club and several of his team-mates after a few sherries on Saturday night. The Republic of Ireland international almost certainly didn’t say anything that wasn’t true but is likely to face disciplinary action for bringing himself and the club into very public disrepute.\nIn nearby Newcastle, the Chronicle reports that Hearts are interested in bringing reserve goalkeeper Freddie Woodman to Tynecastle. Defender Massadio Haïdara may also be heading for the St James’s Park exit door, with 90s synth pop and dance outfit Saint Etienne rumoured to be interested in giving him a fresh start. Tim Krul, Achraf Lazaar and Henri Saivet have also been told they’re surplus to Rafael Benítez’s requirements as the Spaniard focusses on bringing in a new striker for the imminent Premier League campaign. The names of Loïc Rémy and Lucas Pérez have been mentioned in passing.\nThere, that wasn’t so bad. \n"

Yes, why not?”\nHowever, there is no concern among the United hierarchy that a manager whose longest spell at a club was just over three seasons during his first Chelsea tenure will depart in the close season. They feel he is energised by the challenge of managing United, who on Thursday announced record turnover of £141m for the third quarter of 2017, and by trying to claim the club’s first Premier League title since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in May 2013.\nTrying to overhaul Pep Guardiola’s City team, who have dropped only two points from the 33 on offer so far, is also invigorating Mourinho.\nThe manager believes Luke Shaw has a future at United even though the left-back has played only twice this season – as a substitute in EFL Cup ties against Burton Albion and Swansea City. Shaw has made only 20 appearances under Mourinho, though he did suffer ankle ligament damage in April that ruled him out of the end of last season and the start of this.\nShaw has not been named among the substitutes for some matches this term but Mourinho is hopeful the 22-year-old can fight his way back into contention.\nHe is one of five players, with Ander Herrera, Juan Mata, Ashley Young and Daley Blind, who are expected to have extra-year extension clauses in their contracts triggered by the club to take them to summer 2019.

There was then an off-the-cuff invite to watch training after the chat.\n\n\n\n\nJosé Mourinho: Manchester United are not at Real Madrid or Barcelona’s level\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMourinho, according to those close to him, “has been particularly happy” during a near-three week stay that has taken in Los Angeles, Salt Lake City, Houston, Santa Clara and Washington DC. The results helped: 5-2 versus LA Galaxy, 2-1 versus Real Salt Lake, 2-0 versus Manchester City and 2-1 on penalties versus Real Madrid, plus the 1-0 reverse against Barcelona. Following that defeat came the declaration that Real and Barça are different class: this is true. The assertion that Tottenham are the favourites for the league: hmm – Mourinho may be being cute as privately he quite fancies United’s chances.\n\n\n \n\n\nPlay Video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1:18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  José Mourinho satisfied with Manchester United's US tour – video\n\n\n2 Lukaku appears to possess the goods\nTo sanction a £75m outlay for a No9 means goals have to come instantly. Cue to the 38th minute of United’s second friendly, against Real Salt Lake. Romelu Lukaku executes some Fred Astaire footwork, removes a defender and the goalkeeper and hits the winner. Next, cue to the 37th minute of the derby with City in Houston. The Belgian rushes on to a Paul Pogba ball, makes a mug of City’s new No1, Ederson, then has tricky work to execute: scoop the ball in from an angle becoming more acute. Lukaku does and secures another impressive goal. Mourinho adores a big goal-machine of a centre-forward – see Didier Drogba and Diego Costa – so he will hope Lukaku keeps on keeping on when the real stuff starts.\n3 Lindelof has struggled\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  The defender Victor Lindelof needs to swiftly improve his form for Manchester United. Photograph: Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\nThe 23-year-old stands at 6ft 2in yet allowed Galaxy’s 5ft 9in Giovani dos Santos to outjump him at a corner as the Mexican scored his second in Carson. The same player had made Victor Lindelof appear amateurish earlier when ghosting inside the Swede for his first goal.\nLindelof was hauled off at half-time against City and Barcelona in an indication of how Mourinho viewed his displays. The inflated market means £31m is par for a Premier League-unproven centre-back but this is United and Mourinho so a near-instant return is expected. Marcos Rojo is a long-term injury absentee but in Chris Smalling, Phil Jones, Eric Bailly, Daley Blind and the emerging Axel Tuanzebe, Lindelof faces strong competition.\n4 Pogba cements status as de facto captain\nMichael Carrick is the official armband wearer but Paul Pogba is United’s heartbeat, a player who featured the most – with 270 minutes – and who is intent on pointing United forward. On the training ground, in the dressing room, at the team hotel and when in transit Pogba wears a near-permanent smile that puts a bounce into his team-mates. And his role in the acquisition of his friend Lukaku – he dubbed himself “Agent” – can hardly have upset Mourinho and the club. Expect him to have a defining campaign for United.\n5 The ‘missing’ player(s) United flew home without\nLukaku’s arrival in time for the opening day of tour training eased Mourinho’s frustration at having added only Lindelof to his squad. Fast-forward two and a half weeks to the end of the trip and the manager is yet to strengthen further. A theme of Mourinho’s media conferences in America was how two new players would be ideal, though he would settle for one. And that there is empathy regarding the difficulties faced by Ed Woodward, the executive vice-chairman charged with landing United’s targets.\nPrivately it is clear Mourinho wants two signings: a defensive midfielder (at the moment Chelsea’s Nemanja Matic is favourite) and a wide player, with Internazionale’s Ivan Perisic still on the radar. His patience with Woodward is bound to return to pre-tour levels should one or both of these not arrive in the coming week or so.\n"

        "text": "\nFollowing a weekend in which a Twitter spat involving self promotion’s Piers Morgan, scared popster Olly Murs, his waspish fellow crooner James Blunt, the real Toni Kroos and somebody masquerading as Kolo Touré was a surreal highlight, the Rumour Mill finds itself increasingly less sure what to believe anymore. Is Luke Shaw going on loan to Newcastle? The Mirror certainly seems to think so. Rafael Benítez is understood to be interested in ending the full-back’s Manchester United purgatory by bringing him to St James’ Park and José Mourinho should sanction a loan move.\n\n\n\n\nPremier League: 10 talking points from the weekend's action\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuch a move would free up a dressing room peg and car-park space for Atlético Madrid central defender José Giménez, a 22-year-old Uruguayan who is wanted by the Manchester United. Juventus are also interested in bringing Giménez, to Turin and Atletico will sell to the highest bidders. United may also have a fight on their hands to hold on to Anthony Martial, with Real Madrid believed to be lining up a summer bid of £80m bid for the 21-year-old. Out of sorts midfielder Henrikh Mkhitaryan may also be on his way out of Old Trafford if reports that Borussia Dortmund are interested in taking him back are to be believed.\nA summer target of Barcelona, Real Sociedad central defender Iñigo Martínez is now wanted by Manchester City. Barca made three separate approaches for the 26-year-old last August, before deciding against paying his €32m release clause and he has been monitored by City scouts in recent months. Elsewhere in Spain, Atlético Madrid are hitching their skirts in the direction of Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Javier Pastore, but will have to fend off interest from Inter to get him. \n\n\n\n\nThe Dozen: the weekend’s best Premier League photos\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEric Cantona has also urged Manchester United to come in for the PSG outcast. Pastore’s current employers remain interested in bringing Alexis Sánchez to the French capital and the Mirror say they’ve edged ahead of City in the tedious ongoing race to secure the Chilean’s services. Julian Draxler is another player who looks likely to end his association with PSG sooner rather than later and is being tipped with either a return to his native Germany or a move to Liverpool or Arsenal. The Gunners also remain interested in Monaco and France midfielder Thomas Lemar and will try to lure him to the Emirates again following the failure of their €90m August deadline day bid.\nIn managerial news, Martin O’Neill has emerged as the surprise favourite to sort out the mess at Everton. The 65-year-old has been in charge of Ireland since 2013 and has agreed a new deal with the Football Association of Ireland. With the feeling in Ireland being that he has perhaps taken the team as far as they can go under him after their failure to qualify for the World Cup, he could almost certainly take the Everton job with the nation’s blessing. \nMeanwhile at the Hawthorns, Alan Pardew looks likely to succeed Tony Pulis. And in news that suggests they may not realise Tony Pulis and Alan Pardew are currently available, Borussia Dortmund are not going to fire their under-fire and beleaguered manager Peter Bosz, because they can’t think of anyone better to replace him. \n"

        "text": "\nDespite Julia Roberts, an Oscar-winning member of Hollywood royalty, “measuring her excitement” beforehand, there was an under-capacity turnout for this International Champions Cup encounter in Santa Clara, three years after Manchester United and Real Madrid drew 109,318 to Michigan Stadium for a pre-season friendly.\nLevi’s Stadium appeared noticeably under its 68,500 capacity on Sunday, despite the official attendance being given as 65,109. Given Real’s, and to a lesser extent United’s, appeal to California’s large Latino population, there may be questions about why this was not sold-out. That 2014 match in Michigan involved Cristiano Ronaldo who, despite only entering towards the end of the match, was still a draw for US football fans. The forward is not here this time, instead he is in China doing promotional work for Real.\n\n\n\n\nJosé Mourinho guarantees David de Gea is staying with Manchester United\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the match, José Mourinho referred to the Santa Clara crowd: “I don’t know what to say [about the attendance] - is Sunday the best day? ... The price of tickets? I don’t know, Ronaldo not here? I don’t know what to say.” \nOn the field United headed into half-time on Sunday 1-0 ahead, courtesy of some dazzling work from Anthony Martial. The wide man careered into Real’s area, left Daniel Carvajal and Luka Modric like statues, and squared the ball to Jesse Lingard, who passed the ball past Keylor Navas in Real’s goal. The goal lit up a half that had flitted between either end, and came moments after a 41st-minute Lingard shot blazed wide of Navas’s left post.\n“He is a young player, still time to learn, still time to improve, still time to develop, and it’s also his personality, I can say he is training better than before, he’s working harder than before, it’s a question to bring his talent more in a consistent way,” said Mourinho of the 21-year-old Martial, who is an undoubted talent, but struggled last year.\n“Obviously we want more consistency in his talent, I think today was positive for him, that’s why I left him for 90 minutes on the pitch, he was enjoying [the game] and trying things, it’s important to try things in these friendly matches so it’s good for Anthony and his confidence.”\nReal are always a menace with the ball and when Lucas Vazquez took on Phil Jones in a foot-race towards Sergio Romero’s goal the centre-back could be pleased with how he killed the danger. After an early Andreas Pereira corner amounted to nothing for United, Real roved forward for the first time. Carvajal cut into the opposition area and the United defence were relieved to scramble the ball away.\nThis was Real’s opening game of their tour, while United were on their fourth. Mourinho’s men had won all of their previous three, 5-2 against Los Angeles Galaxy, 2-1 against Real Salt Lake, and 2-0 against Manchester City.\nZinedine Zidane’s outfit looked sharp despite their lack of match practice. Gareth Bale sold Marouane Fellaini a dummy and put Carvajal in along the right. Modric buzzed through midfield and pulled strings. And Karim Benzema, the No9, displayed a deft touch.\nFor United Lingard forced a sharp save from Navas, the No14 lining up along the right. Inside him was Pereira, the Belgian-born Brazilian given a chance at No10, though in a fluid system he and Lingard often interchanged.\nOn 18 minutes the Ronaldo-less Real burst into life as Benzema and Bale traded flicks and back-heels and split United open down the left. Later in the half, the two combined in similar fashion. Matteo Darmian may have caught some inspiration from his opponents: the left-back threaded a trequartista-like ball in behind. Lingard was the intended recipient but he failed to capitalise.\nFor the second half Mourinho made wholesale changes so that only Martial, Darmian and Fellaini remained. The manager’s mood may have soured six minutes in when one replacement, Ander Herrera, limped off with what appeared a hip problem. Mourinho has already lost Juan Mata to an ankle problem on the trip so he will hope there is no serious harm to one of his first-choice midfielders.\nThe Portuguese said: “At least [it must be] very painful because for him to come out it has to be painful, I want to wait but I say to the players no risk in friendly matches, if you feel something, that something is coming, a muscular injury, get out, the result is not important. But he was [in pain], maybe a muscle, I don’t know.”\nScott McTominay, Herrera’s replacement, was involved in a melee of bodies that led to a Real free-kick near United’s area. When the ball rebounded Henrikh Mkhitaryan broke and United seized the initiative. Play moved on and Daley Blind chipped an inviting ball into Romelu Lukaku but the centre-forward could only manage an air-shot.\nThat incident was typical of the game. The contest was played at a reasonable tempo but quality was often deficient. So, too, was the ‘challenge’ Victor Lindelöf administered on Theo Hernandez in United’s area after 69 minutes. The centre-back hacked the No15 down and Kevin Stott, the referee, pointed to the spot. Up stepped Casemiro to rifle the ball into the roof of David de Gea’s net.\nNext Smalling conceded a foul just outside his area, to the left. Up stepped Luis Miguel Quezada who aimed directly at De Gea, the No1 having to be alert to beat the ball away and keep the score level.\nBy the close Fellaini could look back on a golden chance that would have given United victory. McTominay swept in a sweet ball from the right. The Belgian’s run was clever; his awkwardly booted wide volley was not. \nThe International Champions Cup rules forced a penalty shoot-out. This proved a curate’s egg as Martial skied over, Mateo Kovacic missed, McTominay missed, Oscar missed, Mkhitaryan rolled the ball in, Quezada scored, Lindelof missed, Hernandez missed, Blind scored and Casemiro missed.\nIt meant United won the spot-kick showdown 2-1, though Zidane stated he was “satisfied”. His team next take on Manchester City in Los Angeles on Wednesday.\nReal Madrid (4-2-3-1): Navas; Carvajal, Varane, Nacho, Marcelo; Kroos, Modric; Vazquez, Isco, Bale; Benzema\nManchester United (4-2-3-1): Romero (De Gea); Fosu-Mensah (Blind, ht), Bailly (Lindelof, ht), Jones (Smalling, ht), Darmian (Valencia, 78); Carrick (Herrera, ht (McTominaym 52)), Fellaini; Lingard (Mkhitaryan, ht), Pereira (Pogba, ht), Martial; Rashford (Lukaku, ht)\n"

        "text": "\nManchester United did what was required by closing the gap to Manchester City to five points, until Sunday afternoon at least. The uneven form of José Mourinho’s side was again evident, yet all that matters as they play catch up with City is to apply as much pressure as possible on the Premier League leaders.\nCity are at Huddersfield Town in the 4pm kick-off and though they are firm favourites to claim victory, United’s deflected winner off Lewis Dunk gives them something to ponder.\nOf this ninth league victory of the campaign, Mourinho said: “You can say it was a bad performance. But it was bad because Brighton were very good from minute one to the last minute.”\n\n\n\n\nManchester City are giving more than just United the blues | Daniel Taylor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMourinho made seven changes, as only Chris Smalling, Paul Pogba, Anthony Martial and Romelu Lukaku survived from Wednesday’s 1-0 defeat at Basel, while Chris Hughton retained 10 of the Brighton XI that drew 2-2 with Stoke City on Monday, Solly March coming in for José Izquierdo.\nUnited’s frontline featured Marcus Rashford and Martial, only the second time Mourinho has started them together in the league this term, following the 4-1 win over Newcastle United.\nThis prompted the rare occurrence of the manager admitting a mistake. “I wouldn’t be surprised if the pundits said we played with too many attackers. But if they say that I would say they were right. Sometimes you play with too many and you lose control of the game,” he said.\n“We had a few problems because Pogba and [Nemanja] Matic were isolated in the midfield. It is a good risk and against Newcastle it was good because [while] we were not very solid defensively we were strong in creating. But today our creation was poor. They were not successful one against one. Marcus did not have a happy match at all.”\nAfter the 2-1 defeat at Huddersfield last month Mourinho complained of his players’ attitude. On Saturday there was a similar issue, certainly before the interval. Bruno Saltor, the Brighton captain, was able to cut through United’s rearguard along the right too easy before finding Pascal Gross. His shot was saved by David de Gea but the home side continued to slumber.\nThe opening half was akin to the Basel defeat: United dominated but were unable to score. Antonio Valencia did manage to stand a cross up for Lukaku but his header missed the target. They ended the first 45 minutes with a point-blank effort from the No9 being blocked near the line.\nThe second half began with Smalling being sold a dummy that left him in a differing postcode but Gross’s ball in was off target. Moments later, when Rashford attempted a similar trick on Gaëtan Bong, he ran into the left-back and fell to the floor.\nFor United to prosper Pogba needed to become more of the influence he was in the victory against Newcastle. Instead, it was the maligned Victor Lindelöf who fired them and the home crowd up with a sliding tackle on Gross. It left Gross prone and the Brighton support booing as those in red shirts played on but suddenly the Old Trafford crowd found its voice and atmosphere.\nThis ratcheted up further when Mourinho took off the anonymous Juan Mata for Zlatan Ibrahimovic. Yet while it remained goalless United remained in danger of a similar late defeat to the one suffered in Switzerland.\n\n\n \n\n\nPlay Video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1:21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  José Mourinho: 'We had too many attackers' – video\n\n\nNow, though, came Ashley Young’s intervention. A Rashford corner came to the left-back, he shimmied, then let fly and the ball went in off the unfortunate Dunk.\nHughton said: “It is not a corner but we did have an opportunity to clear the ball before that.”\nWhether Lukaku got the final touch for the corner did not concern United, though. What they had to do now was protect the lead and three precious points. While a Brighton breakaway featuring Dunk need a last-gasp intervention from the home defence, the first top-flight meeting between the teams in 34 years ended as United wished.\nBut there may, privately, be concern for Mourinho that the early season fluidity and barrage of goals has tapered off. The sole strike here took their tally to seven in the past six league outings, a paltry return following a prolific start of 21 in the opening seven. Asked if he knew why, he replied: “I don’t know.”\nCarrick can count on coaching role\nMichael Carrick has been offered a coaching role with Manchester United when he retires. On Friday the 36-year-old revealed he had undergone a minor heart procedure, after being ruled out since September owing to an irregular heart rhythm. The midfielder is back in training. José Mourinho said: “Michael as a person is more important than Michael as a player. We gave him the time to relax, to recover, to feel confident to make the decision, wants to play, wants to stop. He knows that my coaching staff has a chair for him, if he wants, when he wants. The chair is in the office for him. I want that, the board want that, the owners want that. Michael is in a comfortable position but he wants to play until the end of the season and now he feels confident to be back. He is one more option for us.”\n"

To play away from home and score four goals, we could have scored seven, eight; this was very, very good.”\nTwo first-half goals from Ashley Young set up the win, the second a sublime free-kick from 25 yards.

This is football.”\n“What we needed to do was go back to our defensive stability, which we lost when Matic had to come out. But the important thing is the three points”\nJesse Lingard capped the win with a lovely solo goal but again there was effort but no edge from Romelu Lukaku. “Lukaku needs a big contract with a new boots company; they need to pay him lots of money so that he can start scoring again,” Mourinho joked. “He is such an amazing player for the team, such a good professional.

        "text": "\nThe latest edition of a fixture first played in 1881 was the story of an unimpressive debut from Ederson, the £34.69m-priced goalkeeper, who was culpable for each of Manchester United’s strikes.\nErrors are a feature of close season football and Ederson may make more. Yet given Manchester City’s travails with No1s under Pep Guardiola the hope will be the Brazilian settles quickly.\nUnited and City had begun the 175th staging of this famous fixture by walking through billowing smoke into a darkened NRG Stadium lit up by a sea of supporters’ phones. The ballyhoo belied Jose Mourinho’s insistence in the build-up that this would be a glorified training exercise and so a virtual non-event of a Manchester derby.\n\n\n\n\nManchester United v Manchester City: pre-season friendly – live!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVincent Kompany took the opposing view. The City captain’s pre-game stance was that there can be no friendlies where these two rivals are concerned. To prove the point he took two minutes to clatter into his Belgium team-mate, Romelu Lukaku.\nThis was City’s opening tour match and United’s third. In wins against LA Galaxy (5-2) and Salt Lake City (2-1), Mourinho’s outfit operated at a relative canter. The upturn in tempo here was noticeable as two Premier League big beasts took turns to attack.\nThe red wave came first as Ander Herrera forced the opening save of Ederson’s City career and Lukaku’s surge-and-pass to Jesse Lingard was fluffed by the No14. Now came the sky-blue surge as Phil Foden dribbled forward and let fly a left foot shot that David De Gea had to eye carefully.\nLike Foden, Kyle Walker was making his debut. While the 17-year-old from Stockport cost City nothing and positioned on the left of City’s 4-3-3, the right-back cost an eye-watering initial £45m and operated in his normal right-back berth.\nIn a foot-race with Marcus Rashford Walker showed a prime quality he was acquired for – pace – and shepherded the ball out. On display, too, were further feisty challenges; Rashford and Henrikh Mkhitaryan joined Lukaku as United players who might inform Mourinho the showdown was being contested as it should.\nConsidering this was City’s opening outing since the 5-0 thumping of Watford on 21 May they could be happy with their sharpness. As the stanza wore on Guardiola’s men probed more though they were to end it behind due to Ederson’s mistakes.\nBefore those, Fernandinho leapt on an errant United pass and fed Patrick Roberts. The wide forward was in on goal and then pulled back by Chris Smalling. The referee, Ismail Elfath, failed to blow his whistle, and when possession came to Sterling, Smalling blocked the attempt.\nThe next incident involved Lukaku’s second strike in two games and derived from the one thing Guardiola did not want: an Ederson error. The Catalan’s problems at No1 number began with his bombing out of Joe Hart out last summer and moved onto his replacement, Claudio Bravo, enduring an awful 2016-17 campaign.\nEderson, then, is Bravo’s successor. When Paul Pogba flipped a precise pass into Lukaku out rushed the 23-year-old. But he failed to take ball or man, and from a tight angle the No9 swept home a neat finish.\nThis was on 37 minutes. United’s second came moments later and causes further scrutiny of Ederson. Mkhitaryan roved toward the area and switched play right to Rashford. He took aim and though the effort came hard and true the keeper appeared close enough to ball to stick out a glove. Instead, in it went, and United’s lead was doubled.\nThis was two goals in two minutes. Two yellow cards were about to arrive in the same time-span. Yaya Toure scythed down Mkhitaryan and saw yellow. Then Daley Blind did the same to Roberts and out came the card again.\nFor the second half Guardiola made seven changes and Mourinho made three. What did not change was the shaky nature of Ederson’s bow. From a position reminiscent of David Beckham’s halfway line beating of Wimbledon’s Neil Sullivan in 1996, Rashford launched the ball at City’s goal. The Brazilian scooted back anxiously and just managed to tip over.\nThe next time United attacked Ederson was beaten. But Lukaku’s pile-driver smashed back off the right post and to safety. Further substitutions followed that upset the flow of the match. Of interest here was the sight of Samir Nasri and Eliaquim Mangala in City colours. Each are for sale and as this is proving hard to do, they were being placed in the shop window in the hope to attract suitors.\nBy the close this 134-year-old encounter had created a small slice of Mancunian football history by being played overseas for the first time, in Houston, a city built on swampland, and which is the U.S.A.’s fourth largest.\nUnited triumphed but, as the cliche goes, this was for bragging rights only.

Pogba posted on his Instagram page on Saturday, saying: “See you tomorrow in training rlukaku9 bienvenue AgentP.” Lukaku’s trip has not gone entirely as planned, however, as he was arrested by Beverly Hills police over a noise violation and is due to appear in court on 2 October.\nHis transfer will be worth an initial £75m plus a further £15m of easily attainable add-ons linked to achievements and appearances. Rooney, who is notionally valued at around £10m, would also return to Merseyside after a glittering 13-year career at United, swelling the whole value of the deal on the table to nine figures. Chelsea had tabled their own offer for Lukaku’s services, seeking to re-sign a player they had sold for £28m in 2014.\nYet, while the Premier League champions felt their proposal was roughly equivalent to that on offer from Old Trafford, Everton disagreed, with the Rooney element complicating the process. While the former England captain and United’s record goalscorer was never formally considered to be returning to Goodison Park in part-exchange, his valuation had in effect been built into the Lukaku deal, pushing the overall value of United’s offer to the £100m Everton had always been seeking for the 24-year-old striker. The London club could not provide the same Rooney element in their own proposal and were clearly unwilling to inflate their bid to meet Everton’s overall valuation.\nEven by Friday night, however, Chelsea had feared Lukaku’s representative, Mino Raiola, was intent on pushing his client towards Old Trafford, where he successfully moved Pogba, Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Zlatan Ibrahimovic last summer. The London club, when submitting their bid, had indicated they were unprepared to match the agent fee – apparently amounting to eight figures – on offer to Raiola from United and, instead, felt as if they had presented Lukaku with a simple choice: push to join the club for whom he had initially been so anxious to play again, albeit against his agent’s financial interest; or sign for United in the knowledge Raiola will secure a bigger fee from the deal.\n\n\n\n\nRomelu Lukaku: £75m is never a bargain but Everton striker is worth it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe player, it seems, has opted for the latter. Antonio Conte, who had targeted Lukaku as his first-choice replacement for the outgoing Diego Costa, will be infuriated by his club’s failure to complete a deal, though, while his exasperation was initially made clear to the Chelsea hierarchy, his ire is now increasingly directed at Raiola and Lukaku. The champions must now decide whether to reignite their long-standing interest in Real Madrid’s Álvaro Morata – who had previously been targeted by United – or bid for the Torino forward, Andrea Belotti, whose buy-out clause is set at £87m. There is interest, too, in Arsenal’s Alexis Sánchez though the hierarchy at the Emirates stadium would be reluctant to lose the Chilean to rivals from across the capital.\nConte has been frustrated to date with his team’s progress in the transfer market, but the champions are close to confirming the arrival of Tiemoué Bakayoko from Monaco, and Antonio Rüdiger from Roma with both players due to undertake medicals.\n"

When Ed Woodward, the United executive vice-chairman, made his first approach to Daniel Levy, the Tottenham chairman – and made a preliminary offer of £25m – he was told in no uncertain terms that Dier was not for sale.\nUnited have continued to chip away, bidding £30m and then almost £40m but, in the context of an inflated market, the offers have served only to irritate Levy. Dier lost his place as Tottenham’s first-choice defensive midfielder to Victor Wanyama last season and he has been open to the prospect of the move to Old Trafford, where Mourinho would play him in his preferred position.\nBut Dier has not allowed the situation to affect him and Mauricio Pochettino, who values him enormously, not least because of his tactical flexibility, has been happy to see him put in the hard yards during pre-season. Dier played mostly in defence last season.\nMourinho has signed the centre-half Victor Lindelof and the striker Romelu Lukaku but he has been targeting a defensive midfielder and he is now convinced that he will sign Matic.\n\n\n\n\nPSG increasingly confident of signing Neymar and Alexis Sánchez\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnited have had a £35m offer for him rejected but Matic wants to go to Old Trafford and the Chelsea owner, Roman Abramovich, is willing to grant him his wish as a goodwill gesture in view of the player’s service to the club.\nAbramovich, though, will make United pay – with a fee of £50m having been mooted. Chelsea would be prepared to sell for less to a foreign club, with Juventus among the interested parties, but they continue to smart over how United hijacked their move for Lukaku.\nAntonio Conte has signed Tiemoué Bakayoko from Monaco for £39.7m and he will play him instead of Matic this season.

        "text": "\nDisaster struck for Manchester United with less than a minute of normal time remaining when Michael Lang prodded home to claim a win which means José Mourinho’s team will qualify unless they suffer a record home European defeat in their final Group A game against CSKA Moscow.\nFor that scenario to come into play Basel would also need to beat Benfica to then draw level with United and Moscow on 12 points. The remote chances of this left Mourinho calm about progression to the knockout stage.\n“I don’t think we need a point, I think we can even lose the match, it depends on goals [allowed],” he said. “In relation to this match, at half-time it should be 5-0. They didn’t have a shot, we had a huge percentage of the ball, created numerous chances and the game was easy to win. But you don’t score, the opponent survives, and in the second half you feel they have a chance and in the last minute they score.”\nThis was a fair summation of what occurred, except Mourinho’s team sleep-walked through the second half so the defeat was deserved. The manager made seven changes from Saturday’s win over Newcastle United. Those retained were Chris Smalling, Paul Pogba, Anthony Martial and Romelu Lukaku. Of the players drafted in the most notable were Sergio Romero, who replaced David de Gea, and Marcos Rojo, making a first appearance since the serious knee injury he suffered in April.\nMourinho’s side lined up as a 4-1-4-1 that had Ander Herrera in the holding role. As against Newcastle it was Pogba who sparked United into life. His clever ball put Lukaku in and Marouane Fellaini’s goal-bound header was eventually cleared by Manuel Akanji. Daley Blind delivered the corner on to Smalling’s head but the effort was weak and rolled to safety.\nUnited took hold of the game for a period as Jesse Lingard, Matteo Darmian, Pogba and Fellaini began to swap quick, incisive passes to move their side down the field. One of these forays led to a free-kick; Blind swung the ball in from the right but Fellaini was as profligate with his header as Smalling.\nRaphaël Wicky’s side again began to enjoy possession, though were unable to threaten their visitors. When they did advance close to Romero’s goal United closed the door. At the other end Blind took successive corners, from left and right, but nothing came of them.\nAfter Geoffrey Serey Dié fouled Pogba United had a dead-ball position 20 yards out. But Pogba’s attempt missed disappointingly. Equally remiss was the way Darmian hoofed a cross high into the sky from Lingard’s neat reverse pass. The ball eventually fell onto Blind’s left boot and he proceeded to smack this out rather than find a team-mate.\nUnited spent the closing moments of a soporific opening 45 minutes watching Dimitri Oberlin being equally wasteful from a 30-yard free-kick, Fellaini clip Tomas Vaclik’s left post with a close-range header and Martial sprint through from Herrera’s long-range pass. He could not finish, though, and after Rojo’s 25-yarder hit Marek Suchy’s head and rebounded off the crossbar, the teams wandered off with the game goalless.\nThere was a scare for United at the start of the second half when Renato Steffen was allowed time to pick a cross from the right but, again, it lacked quality. United roved upfield almost instantly and a quick Martial boot-shuffle and Pogba was in but he over-deliberated and the danger passed.\nThe contest had brightened, though. Darmian conceded a handball on the right and when Suchy’s ball in was headed out by Fellaini, Serey Dié flashed a shot just past Romero’s left post. Next up Mohamed Elyounoussi tried his luck from around 35 yards but it was a pea-roller that Romero collected easily. Steffen followed this by racing at a back-pedalling United rearguard, yet once more the shot went straight to the visiting goalkeeper.\nRomero did have to make a sharp save from an Oberlin flick-on and moments later he was beaten but Steffen’s cross-shot went wide of the right post.\nUnited had lost control and now came a series of Basel chances with Lang’s header off Romero’s bar and Elyounoussi’s spurning of the rebound the first of these. Mourinho swapped Marcus Rashford for Lingard and Nemanja Matic for Pogba but still Basel came at his team. After the manager brought on Ibrahimovic for Martial, Lang made his late intervention to leave Basel, along with CSKA, three points behind United. The home side worked it down the left to Raoul Petretta whose fizzing cross was met at the far post by Lang.\nMourinho refused to blame Blind for losing Lang. “Daley was blaming himself, it’s totally unfair,” he said. “I refuse that situation because we are a team in the first half, we should be winning five- or 6-0 and that was not Daley’s fault.”\n"

The Portuguese remains hopeful the transfers of the midfielder and centre-forward can be secured before Sunday. However, it is understood that Mourinho will be dismayed if Lindelof, a 22-year-old centre-back, is the only new player who will be on the flight to America and then relations between Mourinho and Woodward could become strained.\nMourinho is intent that United make a serious challenge for the Premier League title next season after finishing sixth at the close of his first term in charge. In order to do so the 54-year-old wanted to have at least three of the four key new players he wants integrated as early as possible.\nWoodward flew to New Zealand to attend the British and Irish Lions first test against the All Blacks at the end of last month and this caused some surprise among Mourinho’s staff. There is an acknowledgment that Chelsea’s desire to land Monaco’s Tiemoué Bakayoko before allowing Matic to leave and Real’s interest in David de Gea are stumbling blocks. But there is a sense that Woodward needs to rise to the challenge of securing their signatures before Sunday.\nMourinho said after the Europa League final victory on 24 May: “Ed Woodward has my analysis, has what I want, what I would like for more than two months. Now it’s for him, now for the owners and the people who work with him [to sort], so I just wait.”\nUnited play LA Galaxy on 16 July, Real Salt Lake City (18 July), Manchester City (21 July), Real Madrid (23 July) and Barcelona (27 July) in a hectic 11-day schedule, following a six-day training camp at in Los Angeles.\n"

They are second in the Premier League and are unbeaten at Old Trafford, where Burton Albion remain the only team to have scored a goal against them all season. They have the best defensive record in all four divisions, having conceded just four goals since starting out in August with a 4-0 win over West Ham.\n\n\n\n\nN’Golo Kanté seals Chelsea rout of Manchester United to ruin Mourinho return\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerhaps it is not so far a great season, given the recent defeat at Huddersfield, the cautious tactics at Liverpool and the fact that Manchester City are five points better off, but it could be a lot worse.\nJosé Mourinho could be in Antonio Conte’s position, for example, and goodness knows how unhappy he would be then. He could have just been savaged twice in Italy, first by Roma and then by the critics, after an abject performance led Chelsea to become the first English side to lose in the Champions League this season. He could have lost his first home match of the season, against Burnley. He could have needlessly alienated Diego Costa, then tried and failed to bring Romelu Lukaku back in the summer, only to see the Belgian striker opt for life with a major rival. He could have sanctioned the sale of Nemanja Matic to Manchester United, and then had to deal with N’Golo Kanté being injured when some big games came along.\nAt the very least the United manager should be able to enjoy himself at Stamford Bridge on Sunday afternoon a little more than he did last season when, it might be recalled, a Chelsea side on their way to the title wiped the floor with their former manager and his new team.\nHistory could repeat itself, you never know, but the momentum is with United at the moment and there seems little chance of another 4-0 drubbing. United have tightened up their defence, Chelsea have lost a lot of confidence and Conte no longer seems to know his most effective lineup, whereas last season he was sure of it.\nYet enjoyment appears to be eluding Mourinho this season. He is probably already working out how to respond to accusations of parking the bus if he gains a result at Chelsea with the sort of stifling tactics employed against Liverpool and Tottenham. His claim that he is not getting the credit he deserves for some impressive performances warrants closer examination, even if what he really means is that rivals such as Pep Guardiola and Mauricio Pochettino are garnering all the praise.\nIt is true that United neutralised a Spurs team who scored four against Liverpool and three against Real Madrid, but what Mourinho neglects to mention is that Harry Kane was missing at Old Trafford and Pochettino set out his own stall quite defensively.\n\n\n \n\n\nPlay Video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1:09\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Chelsea prepare to host Manchester United in Premier League – video preview\n\n\nThe glowing reviews of Spurs’ latest Champions League performance were still bothering Mourinho a couple of days later. “What is magic, what is phenomenal?” he asked. “The way Tottenham played against Real Madrid? I think I recently saw a team play exactly that way, and the reaction was negative. I was watching from the touchline [he is referring to the 1-0 win against Spurs] and I saw a team defending, pressing, controlling all the penetration, playing with five at the back but projecting the full-backs and going forward in quick transitions, and some people did not enjoy it.”\nThis is always the nub of the issue with Mourinho and his teams. One could say United were highly competitive against Spurs, well-organised and supremely professional, but magic would be a stretch too far. Whereas some of Tottenham’s displays this season have bordered on the sublime, as have some of Manchester City’s. Here, perhaps, is the basis for what is shaping up to be another winter of Mourinho discontent. He is perfectly well aware that playing the percentages is not really what United fans pay to see, though he is too much of a roundhead to come over all cavalier at this late stage.\nThe story of his career, an undeniably successful one, has been based on strategy, efficiency and risk-elimination. The Mourinho philosophy was perhaps best summed up in his own words after last season’s Europa League success. Once again responding to criticism of his side’s playing style, or perhaps that should be yet again, the Portuguese encapsulated his outlook in a short but memorable soundbite. “There are lots of poets in football,” he observed. “But poets don’t win many titles.”\nOne does not have to look too far across Manchester to spot the potential flaw in this argument. While Guardiola would probably not describe himself as a poet he does happen to think you should play in a certain way, with an emphasis on possession-based attacking football, and his team happen to be top of the Premier League. Unbeaten, in fact, with an enormous number of goals scored and fans swooning on a regular basis at the expressiveness and elegance of the football being played.\nIt would be foolish to say at this stage that Manchester City are going to run away with the title and leave Mourinho and his pragmatism looking like one of the more prosaic passages of history. It would be much wiser to leave judgment until later in the season, or at least until City have played Arsenal on Sunday afternoon. But it is a possibility, and one that could explain why Mourinho has been so tetchy of late. City are proving resistant to his template for football achievement, just as Barcelona did when he was in Spain.\n\n\n\n\nBigger, relentless, pitiless: are Mourinho’s Manchester United the real deal? | Jonathan Wilson\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnited were installed as early title favourites because of Mourinho’s enviable record of second-season success, though this is Guardiola’s second season at City, too, and all the signs indicate that lessons have been learned since his first campaign. City ended up with nothing last season, while United claimed the League Cup and the Europa League, but titles in the sense of finishing on top of the table are what both managers crave.\nWhile Mourinho was miffed last Saturday that a huge step in the right direction was not recognised as such, everything United do at the moment is put into perspective by City’s healthy lead. That may change on Sunday, though the date looming large in Mancunian diaries is 10 December, when City visit Old Trafford.\nThe renewal of the Guardiola-Mourinho rivalry from Spain did not really happen as predicted last season because both clubs spent time off the pace. Next month’s derby will not just pit the poetry against the prose, it could see some of the el clásico needle transported to the north of England.\n"

It is a big match but not because of that. It is a big match because they are the champions. It is a big match because we are Manchester United. No more than that.”\nMourinho suffered his heaviest Premier League defeat last October at Stamford Bridge when United went down 4-0. He introduced an element of levity to proceedings when asked how his players have grown since then. “Maybe [Marcus] Rashford, two centimetres,” he replied. “Scott McTominay, three centimetres.”\nMourinho is due in Spain on Friday to face accusations of tax fraud, which he denies.

I’m sure they respect that but if not I don’t really care.”\nThe champions’ decision to allow Matic to join United caused surprise. “The only thing I can say is that I am happy to be part of this club,” he said. “I’m happy to be working with Mourinho. That’s all I can say. As I said, when I played at Chelsea I give always my best to help the team but now Manchester United is my club and I will try to win there.”\nMatic’s 45th-minute shot led to Mile Svilar’s own goal in United’s 2-0 win over Benfica at Old Trafford on Tuesday. The victory gave Mourinho’s team 12 points from four games, and one more point would guarantee qualification for the knockout stages. Chelsea lost 3-0 at Roma but Matic is wary of Antonio Conte’s side.\n“We know we must respect them,” he said. “They are a good team, they’re champions and it’s going to be a hard game for us, but we also have our own qualities.”\nUnited have 23 points, five fewer than the leaders, Manchester City, and Chelsea are four points further back. “The Premier League is difficult,” Matic said. “It doesn’t matter if you’re first with five points, even seven or 10. You lose two games and the other teams are there, so it’s important not to lose points, of course, but there’s a long way to go.”\nThibaut Courtois believes Chelsea’s chances of retaining the title rest on defeating United. “This is a must-win game,” the goalkeeper said. “Manchester City are already nine points ahead of us, Manchester United four and Tottenham one. We must win games like these to remain at the top and close to the other ones. We will try to get the three points and will give our lives for it on Sunday.”\n"

It is a standard greeting, an anodyne pleasantry, so of course José Mourinho, who did not get where he is today by being standard or anodyne, chose to subvert it.\n“I hope you enjoy the game more than some of you did against Tottenham,” was how the Manchester United manager addressed his public, continuing the needless bickering with the club’s supporters he began after the narrow league victory on Saturday.\n\n\n Quick guide José's home truths  \n\n\n Show \n\n\n Hide  \n\n\n\n\nChelsea (Nov 2014)\n\n'At this moment it’s difficult to play at home because playing here is like playing in an empty stadium'\n\n\n\nManchester United (Jan 2017)\n\n'The fans – they also have to do better … So my invitation is don’t come to the theatre, come to play, play with us'\n\n\n\nManchester United (April 2017)\n\n'Did the supporters know it [how much the players were struggling]?

It was easy to know that was a goal because it was the first time I really understood the stadium was full'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas this helpful?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you for your feedback.\n\n\n\n\nMourinho may have had a point in arguing that his replacement of Marcus Rashford with Anthony Martial was ultimately what won United that game, whether the crowd liked it or not, but what supporters found much harder to understand was his allegation that there was not enough love around the place for Romelu Lukaku. The way Mourinho told it you might imagine the fans had been on the striker’s back, venting their disappointment that his early-season goals had dried up, when nothing could be further from the truth.\nMost people were unaware of any sort of anti-Lukaku negativity until Mourinho mentioned it in a television interview. Similarly his hushing gesture at the end of the Spurs match was not directed at any section of the crowd, none of whom were grumbling by that stage anyway, but down the barrel of the nearest television camera. The manager was confident such an action would be picked up and commented on around the world, which it was, but now United fans are beginning to ask why he would rather pick a fight than celebrate a victory, and why he seems to be seeing problems where none really exist.\n\n\n\n\nManchester United make Benfica’s Mile Svilar suffer again despite penalty save\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo reiterate, no United supporters were complaining that they had not enjoyed Saturday’s game, though some felt Rashford did not deserve to be brought off. And the levels of affection or appreciation for Lukaku would be best measured by the crowd reaction when he scored or engineered a goal, which he did not manage against Spurs, even if he did win an important header to send Martial on his way. Mourinho can hardly expect Old Trafford to go into raptures when the striker sees a shot blocked or a header come back off a post.\nGoodness knows what Lukaku makes of it all, it must be slightly deflating for a £75m striker to hear his manager urging paying spectators to be more conspicuously grateful for his presence, though the Belgian did not appear to let it affect his game. Presumably he felt that demanding to take the early penalty Martial won against Benfica would have amounted to trying too hard to win favour with the crowd, though he might have had second thoughts once he saw the weak attempt from the winger that allowed Mile Svilar to partially redeem himself for his error in Lisbon.\n\n\n \n\n\nPlay Video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1:41\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Some people speak too much, says José Mourinho – video\n\n\nAfter half an hour of somehow failing to find the big fella up front United suddenly presented Lukaku with two openings in two minutes. He missed them both, but not badly, first forcing a save from Svilar with a left-foot shot then heading over the bar when he found himself a bit too far under Martial’s cross to be able to attack the ball. The crowd applauded politely on both occasions, as one might in the circumstances.\nOne of the things Mourinho could do if he seeks a livelier atmosphere at Old Trafford is import Benfica’s supporters, volubly behind their team from beginning to end. Another, slightly more practical thing perhaps, would be to organise his side so that their main goalscorer sees a little more of the ball. Lukaku was isolated for most of the first half, though he was able to claim involvement in supplying Nemanja Matic for the shot that gave United an interval lead. The former Benfica player will not be able to claim it as his first for Manchester United: his shot struck the foot of a post, though the 18-year-old goalkeeper who provided an unwitting decisive touch probably feels it is about time his Champions League luck changed.\n\n\n\n\nMourinho programme notes suggest tension with Manchester United fans\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLukaku possibly feels the same. Given the chance to increase United’s lead in first-half stoppage time the striker powered into the area with only Svilar to beat, though delayed his shot a fraction too long and allowed Rúben Dias to put him off his stride. With his next opportunity he miscontrolled Daley Blind’s pass, then a Juan Mata cross failed to reach him, there was a burst of speed down the touchline after an hour and all the time Lukaku was still coming back into his own half to assist the defence. As Mourinho says, he works hard in games. But anyone can see that; no one was actually saying he doesn’t. He just needs a goal after six games, as was shown by his eagerness to take the second penalty before being overruled. “I think the manager decided,” Matic said. There’s a surprise. So much for being untouchable.\n"

When Jonathan Moss, the referee, blew for full time Mourinho put a finger to his lips and gestured to the nearest camera.\n\n\n\n\nJosé Mourinho’s game of chicken will pay off until the opponent does not blink\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reason was unhappiness at fans booing Anthony Martial’s introduction for Marcus Rashford and also for their muted backing of Romelu Lukaku. Mourinho could shush fans, inform the press that supporters need to “relax a little bit”, and criticise to MUTV their treatment of Lukaku, because his team had just claimed a vital victory over a title rival. United and Tottenham entered the match level on 20 points, five behind Manchester City. By Saturday evening Mourinho’s men retained the same deficit but Spurs were eight points behind following City’s win at West Bromwich Albion.\nMourinho could also upbraid fans because his decision to swap Martial for Rashford was sweetly vindicated by the Frenchman being the scorer of the 81st‑minute winner and Lukaku providing the flick-on for this.\nThe manager’s public utterances are often described as a diversionary tactic. This, though, can be an over-complicated reading of a someone whose every word and antic is exhaustively analysed.\nCertainly on this occasion the questioning of the Rashford-substitution boos and Lukaku’s poor reception was not to deflect attention given United were victorious. So, the reason may be simple: Mourinho was being Mourinho, a man whose stance is that he has the right to have a say on everything – including his own fans – just as they do about his team.\n\n\n Quick guide José's home truths  \n\n\n Show \n\n\n Hide  \n\n\n\n\nChelsea (Nov 2014)\n\n'At this moment it’s difficult to play at home because playing here is like playing in an empty stadium'\n\n\n\nManchester United (Jan 2017)\n\n'The fans – they also have to do better … So my invitation is don’t come to the theatre, come to play, play with us'\n\n\n\nManchester United (April 2017)\n\n'Did the supporters know it [how much the players were struggling]?

Jeers that accompanied his removal were understandable, especially as he was among United’s best performers. Mourinho acknowledged the point.\n“They [fans] pay the ticket they can do what they want,” he said. “They can boo a player that doesn’t deserve to be booed, they can boo a player who is working like an animal, even though the game is not going in his direction. They can boo – they pay their tickets, they can boo the manager.”\nMourinho is a serial moaner about atmosphere, which further underlines how he is following form. After a 2-0 EFL Cup win over Hull City at Old Trafford in January, he compared the atmosphere to “the theatre”. Liverpool were up next and the 55-year-old wanted their fiercest rival to be entering a cauldron.\nOld Trafford is rarely a bear pit, though. Sometimes, maybe, but there is difficulty recalling a match-long vibe of heightened emotion and noise. Saturday offered an illustration. When a Lukaku header hit a post suddenly the stadium came alive – showing how sleepy it had become.\nOld Trafford does generally boast a loyal crowd. It required a relative age before the support turned on David Moyes and Louis van Gaal during their unhappy tenures. So, considering United appear genuine title contenders for the first time since Sir Alex Ferguson retired, Saturday’s reaction was jarring – especially as the Stretford End had earlier been quick to regale Mourinho when their Spurs counterparts sang a ditty that abuses him.\n\n\n \n\n\nPlay Video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1:41\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Some people speak too much, says José Mourinho – video\n\n\nA sense is that Mourinho’s request for fans to have more faith in him and his players is an apt move: all the Portuguese wants is for United to succeed, and the fans can be a telling factor in this.\n\n\n\n\nManchester United’s Anthony Martial rises to occasion to sink Spurs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the dire 2-1 defeat at Huddersfield Town and 0-0 draw at Liverpool, the Spurs result has United back on track. As Nemanja Matic said: “We dropped points there and it was important for us to win again to show we want to fight for the title, that we have quality and I am happy we did it. It was a big result, against a great team. Tottenham, the last few years, play really good football, they have a great manager, the idea of their football is good.\n“I think that the title, you win in the let’s say ‘small games’ but also if you want to be first you have to win games like this, especially when you play at home you cannot drop points. It’s important for us, it’s a lot of pressure on us but we managed to score and to win.”\nUnited got their goal following the booed switch of Martial for Rashford. Mourinho is paid to make these decisions, and for them to work. Maybe Saturday will help to convince supporters to trust the way he works a little more.\n"

But one of them ended up at Manchester United instead, and the other might as well – the Daily Star report that a £35m fee has been agreed between Monaco and the Mancunians for the midfielder. And what might make this development even more upsetting for Chelsea is the fact that they indirectly caused it themselves, by deciding not to sell Nemanja Matic to United because they were in a wild huff over Lukaku’s decision to remain in the north, thus forcing them to seek midfield reinforcements elsewhere. When Tottenham were also unwilling to part with Eric Dier, attention switched to France.\n\n\n\n\nTransfer window 2017 – every deal in Europe's top five leagues\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChelsea will get over the disappointment the only way they know how: by liberally and only vaguely discriminately spraying transfer cash across Europe. Some of it may well be heading towards Madrid, with the Spanish outlet Diario Madridista claiming that they “are obsessed with signing Danilo”, Real’s Brazilian right-back. The move has come “at the express request of Antonio Conte, who wants the defender at any price”, apparently. Real aren’t keen to sell, inevitably, and the €24m that they have so far been offered is not enough to convince them. Also in Spain, AS are reporting that Chelsea are to offer €80m for Álvaro Morata, that it might be enough to convince Real to sell, and that, Lukaku be damned, “he was always Conte’s first choice”.\nUnited, meanwhile, still have a few cheques left in their book. One of them might be winging its way to Internazionale, whose Croatian wideman Ivan Perisic set tongues wagging by liking Paul Pogba’s Instagram post delighting in Romelu Lukaku’s move to Manchester and then posting a picture of himself in an airport. Apparently £45m might be sufficient for Inter to usher him out the door, though his manager, Luciano Spalletti, might make the process difficult. “You keep talking about Perisic and his desire to leave,” he told the press on Sunday, “but we are Inter and we can choose to make different decisions to the ideas of the players.”\nTalking of chequebooks, Everton recently found theirs down the back of a forgotten cupboard in a dusty Goodison Park storeroom and now they’re going absolutely wild. Next through the door will apparently be Gylfi Sigurdsson, the Swansea superman, for whom they have already had three bids rejected: a fourth offer of £32m could finally seal the deal, says the Mail.\nOn the subject of multiple bids finally bearing fruit, Arsenal could be close to a deal with Monaco for Thomas Lemar, with the Mirror reporting that the Gunners are totally convinced the winger wants to head to London, and believe that £45m will be enough to convince his club to let him leave.\n\n\n\n\nWayne Rooney and Everton are well placed for a fruitful and warm reunion | Nick Ames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJames Rodríguez has been the subject of constant transfer gossip pretty much since the start of the last World Cup, a switch to a Real Madrid team who didn’t really need him in 2014 having only temporarily stopped the flow of stories, but this could be the week that it finally ends. The Colombian apparently wants to finalise his future within the next couple of days, pitting Manchester United and Chelsea against each other once again but this time with Paris Saint-Germain also involved. A fee “in the region of £62m” will be required, again according to the Mail.\nFinally Leicester are ready to sell the midfielder Tom Lawrence, whose loan move to Ipswich last year ended with him being named player of the season, to Derby County for £7m. Another loan move that could lead to something more permanent is Steven Berghuis’s to Feyenoord, who having had the Watford winger last season now want him back for good. “We hope he signs,” said their manager, Giovanni van Bronckhorst. “He also wants to play for Feyenoord. But we still have a few weeks to get deals done.” And Glenn Whelan could be on his way to Burnley, who would be willing to pay £2.5m for the 33-year-old. \n"

        "text": "\nOne of the hallmarks of the best José Mourinho teams was that capacity to engineer specialist victories seized from the most demanding venues. Think back to his emergence on the international scene in 2003-04 with Porto. His unfashionable team delivered a cool 1-1 draw at Real Madrid and then came that touchline sprint at Old Trafford after a last-minute equaliser en route to lifting the Champions League trophy.\nIn his first spell at Chelsea he set up his side for wins at Liverpool, Tottenham and Manchester United to power the cruise to the title. On to Internazionale’s treble and a 2-0 masterclass to beat Bayern Munich in the 2010 Champions League final. Then, with Real Madrid, a crucial clásico win over Barcelona at the Camp Nou that all but sealed La Liga. The examples are manifold. It is not difficult to close the eyes and half-imagine a stereotype away-day masterclass scripted by Mourinho in his pomp.\n\n\n\n\nManchester United pay for their meek approach against Chelsea | Jonathan Wilson\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn his return to English football with Chelsea, the 2-0 win in April 2014 at Liverpool – where Steve Gerrard’s slip had allowed the visitors to open the scoring – served as a perfect reminder of the classic Mourinho blueprint. It illustrated how to frustrate opponents who love to express themselves, get an unyielding foothold in a match, wait for the moment to pounce and break some hearts while his team’s beat makes the decisive noise.\nFor modern managers who have created a methodology that has delivered success the temptation is to stick with it. United’s performance at Stamford Bridge on Sunday in a 1-0 defeat was not altogether surprising. Mourinho was never likely to send his team out to go for the jugular. Even though United are second in the table, even though Chelsea appeared to be in a vulnerable position on the back of shaky results and reports of friction, Mourinho reverted to type for an important challenge and sought to keep the game tight as his platform. It did not come off.\nIn Mourinho’s last 10 matches against top six Premier League opponents away from home, which dates back to April 2015 when he was the manager of Chelsea, his teams have scored only once. That is one goal in 900 minutes (plus a bunch of stoppage time) of football. This kind of statistic, given that he is employed by clubs clearly aiming to win the Premier League, has to be alarming. Yes, there are a respectable mix of 0-0 thou-shalt-not-be-beaten-or-else draws in there but the knack for pivotal performances in these fixtures is off kilter. United are high in the table, best placed to challenge the league leaders Manchester City, but Mourinho could not help but go into the Chelsea game prepared to box cautiously. His brain has always worked that way.\nIf one spools back to the day he was appointed United manager, the killer question was always going to boil down to how successful the mix of philosophies would turn out. In an ideal world one would take the best of Mourinho’s strategic work and ruthless drive, and the core of the attacking spirit that is woven into the fabric of United as a club, and create the right balance for a winning formula. But at times there seems some kind of disconnect. It was evident in that dreary draw at Anfield and to an extent in United’s more rigid display at Chelsea. Not many teams win the league without pulling the odd rabbit out of a hat in tough away games and United’s reticence to be too ambitious does not look like helping them bridge the gap City have opened up.\nDespite being well manned in midfield they conceded the central battleground. Despite selecting two attackers they were too often isolated. No midfielders seemed willing to gamble with a forward run past them and the creative instincts did not fire. United seemed more uptight as a team than they were at the start of the season when the goals flowed and opposition were steamrollered with a sense of fun prevailing on the pitch.\nThe lack of a midfielder of Paul Pogba’s quality, character and presence is impacting on the way they tackle these games. His return from injury cannot come soon enough. Even so, the dependence on still playing the Marouane Fellaini card to rescue a difficult hand tells of a broader story. United have spent £322m on transfer fees since Mourinho arrived and perhaps should have a more progressive game plan in those crucial games that can tilt a season’s storyline.\nUnited have lost only twice this season and in a normal campaign with their points haul they would not be so far off the blistering pace being set across town by City. It is well within their powers to go on a winning run between now and the intriguing derby set for next month. But until Mourinho can rediscover the clinical edge he used to instil in his teams for big away matches, it is hard to see how he can pick a more equal fight with Pep Guardiola. That solitary goal in 10 meaty away tests is a problem that needs to be solved.\n"

Then he stays sitting on the toilet for the entire day. The Mill’s frantic banging on the bathroom door is an epic symphony to his ears. The Mill ends up messing itself. Mourinho looks in the mirror and smirks. He is a champion again.\n\n\n\n\nTransfer window 2017 – every deal in Europe's top five leagues\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat nightmare story may sound like a trumped-up excuse for wetting the bed and, OK, fair cop. But it is also true that Mourinho’s approach to football matches seems to be about frustrating and humiliating the opponent, as if all Mourinho really wants to do is stop the other team from doing what they want to do. Bearing that in mind, Manchester United’s latest manoeuvre in the transfer market might really tickle him. Because word is that United are going to disburse a world record fee to sign Romelu Lukaku, solving their striking problems and, crucially, thwarting Chelsea’s plans. Could Lukaku turn out to be a more mobile version of Zlatan Ibrahmovic? Don’t be silly. Could he at least lead the line well for United and convert some of those chances that they kept missing last season? Probably. Could he score for someone else if United have him? Absolutely not. Result!\nThus United may make getting Lukaku one of the conditions of allowing Wayne Rooney to go on his Proustian tour of Goodison Park.\nTo be honest, the Mill has been expecting United to wade in with a bid for Virgil van Dijk this summer just to annoy Liverpool but there’s no indication of any such move just yet. Mourinho isn’t even making a move for Philippe Coutinho but that sure doesn’t mean that Liverpool can rest easy: because Paris Saint-Germain are said to be preparing a bumper bid for the Brazilian. The French club is trying to sweeten the deal by chucking in Lucas Moura, knowing that Jürgen Klopp can’t resist a nimble winger.\nSpeaking of French clubs, Bordeaux are hopeful of ending Nampalys Mendy’s short stay at Leicester. And Marseille want to continue their revamp by prising Munir El Haddadi from Barcelona and Carlos Bacca from Milan.\nSean Dyche’s attempt to turn Burnley into the 27th county of the Republic of Ireland will continue apace as he completes the signing of Jon Walters, who will join Robbie Brady, Jeff Hendrick, Stephen Ward and Kevin Long on the playing staff at Murph Moor. On the way out of Burnley, meanwhile, is Andre Gray, presumably to make room for Niall Quinn. Gray is expected to resurface at West Ham.\n\n\n\n\nWayne Rooney back at Everton would be a fairytale – but it may well end in tears | Paul Wilson\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuddersfield’s preparations for their first top-flight campaign since before Britain joined the European Economic Community will continue with the capture of the defender Mathias Jorgensen from FC Copenhagen.\nWatford want to rekindle their relationship with Nathaniel Chalobah, who previously won hearts at Vicarage Road during a loan spell away from Chelsea, who continue to like him at arm’s length.\nBirmingham are hopeful the esteem in which Southampton hold Harry Redknapp will help smooth through a loan bid for the striker Sam Gallagher. The Mill fancies that it might be wise to have a back-up plan for that one.\n"

        "text": "\nClose your eyes, sit back and think yourself back to the 2008-09 season. These were happier times. Innocent times. Sir Alex Ferguson was still warming the bench and indeed the dressing-room air at Manchester United; Arsène Wenger could still be relied upon to qualify Arsenal for the Champions League; and Roy Hodgson’s stock was riding high as he guided Fulham to seventh place in the Premier League and qualification for the Europa League. Who wouldn’t want to go back to 2008-09? Hodgson certainly would, which could be why he seems so keen to sign Carlton Cole.\nThe Englishman, now 33, was still a promising young pup then, and on his way to a best-ever single-season league-only goal return of 10. Since then he has been released by West Ham, signed by West Ham again, released by West Ham again and had spells at Celtic (five games), Sacramento Republic (four) and Persib Bandung (five), the Indonesian side and current answer to the question “where the heck is Michael Essien these days?”. However Crystal Palace, Hodgson’s latest employers, are neck-deep in a striking crisis and any out-of-contract player with Premier League experience, two legs and no crutches is therefore of interest.\n\n\n\n\nFrom Michael Essien to Carlton Cole: the story of five former Premier League players in Indonesia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManchester United have despatched scouts to Italy, where they are busily monitoring the Roma midfielder and long-term friend of the Mill, Radja Nainggolan. “Mourinho is understood to be making plans for Michael Carrick’s retirement,” reports the Mirror, “and the Belgium international is his first choice. But United are also scouting young people who you might not already have known about for several years, and had a representative keeping a close eye on Keinan Davis during Aston Villa’s 4-0 win over Burton Albion on Tuesday night. They’re not the only ones keen on Keinan, as Arsenal, Everton, Swansea, Stoke and Brighton also had scouts at the game. \nUnited scouts have clearly been busy, with news also breaking that they have been avidly pursuing the Sarpsborg midfielder Krepin Diatta. “I’ve spoken to Manchester United’s scouts twice,” the 18-year-old told Norwegian television. “First at the Under-20 World Cup, and again after the game against Brann. To join them would be a dream come true. I think I’m good enough, but we’ll see what happens in the future.” The Sarpsborg sporting director, Thomas Berntsen, has also been chatting about Diatta, insisting “that there are many clubs” watching him, that “he is the most exciting young player in Norway” and that “he will cost a lot of money, without any shadow of doubt”.\nElsewhere, Internazionale have abandoned all hope of signing Shkodran Mustafi from Arsenal in January, because they won’t be able to. And the forgotten Watford defender Brice Dja Djedje, left out of the club’s Premier League squad yet again, has vowed to force through a move to Marseille in January. “I hope to leave Watford,” he said. “I can’t bear it any more. It has crossed the line. I’m at my limit.”\n"

        "text": "\nJosé Mourinho has refused to commit his long-term future to Manchester United, with the manager stating that in football the “future is tomorrow”.\nThe Portuguese is nearing the halfway point of a three-year contract signed in 2016, yet despite this meaning he enters its final year next summer, Mourinho is not currently prepared to commit to staying on further.\n\n\n\n\nDejan Lovren accuses Romelu Lukaku of deliberately kicking him in the face\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Guardian understands Mourinho will extend his tenure at Old Trafford if he is offered a sizeable pay rise but publicly the 54-year-old pointed to the terms he agreed to when becoming manager. “The answer is exactly that – nothing is happening, I’m at Manchester United, I have a contract and that’s it,” he said as he prepared for his side’s Champions League group match at Benfica on Wednesday.\nAsked if he would like to sign on beyond summer 2019, Mourinho replied: “I don’t think there is an answer for that. I’m not in conditions to answer to that because there is nothing to answer; I have a contract and that’s it. I have my contract that ends in May/June 2019, we are in October 2017, so I don’t know what to say.”\nMourinho praised Paris Saint-Germain at the weekend and stated that he did not see himself finishing his career at United. He moved to clarify these comments here. “The only thing that I told and is true and there was not misinterpretation of my words is I am not going to end my career at Manchester United,” he said.\n“I ask how is it possible in modern football that a manager is going to last 15 or 20 years. I think Arsène Wenger is the last one. It is impossible for us to last for so long. If in this moment I want to finish my career in four or five years, my ambition would be to end my career at Manchester United.\n“I think I’m going to be 15 years minimum in the job [as a manager] and I think it’s impossible to stay 17 years in the same club, even if you want, even if you try. I think Wenger will be the last one to do that; that was my answer [at the weekend]. I don’t think I’m going to end my career at Manchester United. After that people try to be clever, malicious. I didn’t think about signing a new contract but I don’t think about leaving, too.”\nRegarding the claim by Liverpool’s Dejan Lovren, who said Romelu Lukaku deliberately kicked him during United’s 0-0 draw at Anfield on Saturday, Mourinho said: “You know I read something [about this] but there is a bit of contradiction there,” he said, “because he says: ‘Let’s move on and forget what happened,’ but then he spends 10 minutes about what he thinks happened and didn’t happen.\n“So for me these are words without any meaning and the FA committee [which has taken no action] is there to analyse and make decisions, so no comment.”\nUnited are top of Group A and face Benfica having taken maximum points from their opening two fixtures while Rui Vitória’s side have lost twice, to CSKA Moscow and Basel. Yet Mourinho, who left the injured Eric Bailly back in Manchester, remains wary of the Portuguese champions.\n“Nobody knows what’ll happen. Benfica could win 12 points and finish with the same possibilities as everyone else,” the manager said. “What I was trying to show yesterday was Benfica are much better than CSKA Moscow and Basel. I think the players were convinced in the meeting we had in the morning that results aren’t the real indicator of the value of a team.\n“I think qualification is out of the question [if they lose], so I believe Benfica need to make a point without question. The strategy that Rui will choose, offence or defence, I don’t know. But I have studied Benfica the best I could. I’ve been getting to know them to make a thorough analysis of their play. Rui has done many different things in the Champions League.”\nIn addition to Bailly, Mourinho remains without Paul Pogba, Marouane Fellaini, Michael Carrick and Zlatan Ibrahimovic. Luke Shaw and Marcos Rojo, returning from lengthy lay-offs, travelled to Portugal’s capital and trained on Tuesday afternoon, though neither is expected to start.\nMourinho said of his plans for Wednesday evening: “I will not tell you the team. First, because the players don’t know yet and second, with so many injuries, I think that should be something that you can view with almost a guarantee of success because our options are so few that it is easy for you to guess the XI.”\nAshley Young should be in the side and the 32-year-old is enjoying a renaissance at full-back. “It’s one of those things as a professional player now that you have to be able to play in different positions and be versatile,” he said. “I’ve found myself playing at full-back, enjoying it and playing well. Wherever the manager wants me to play, I go out and give 100%. Whenever I pull on the United shirt I look to do as well as I can.”\n"

With him [I am] very pleased.”\nMourinho voiced his disquiet to MUTV, United’s in-house broadcaster which is always careful to avoid controversy. It underlines his unhappiness that he gave the response to a question that made no mention of how Lukaku had been greeted by fans.\nThe discontent follows Mourinho’s criticism of those fans who booed Martial’s replacement of Marcus Rashford.

Asked about that he said: “Some people speak too much. You know, calm down, relax. Relax a little bit. Don’t speak too much – speak, speak, speak. You know, relax.”\n"

Then we imagined meeting him, handing him a pen and paper and asking him to write down all the reasons he should shun his suitors and stay at Spurs. In this made-up scene Rose paused to think, chewing the top of the pen as he did so. Then he bit the top off and swallowed it before scoffing the rest, too. He wouldn’t be needing that pen. He took the sheet of paper and made it into a plane, as if to say that it can fly down the wing at Wembley for Spurs instead, because he’s off to Manchester. And why not?\nNot that Mauricio Pochettino is bothered. Because he has a cunning plan, albeit one that depends on Rose opting for United instead of becoming Benjamin Mendy’s stand-in at City. Because if Rose does choose Old Trafford, then Spurs will use that as leverage to reunite Luke Shaw with Pochettino, the man under whom he broke through at Southampton.\n\n\n\n\nArsenal may sell Mesut Özil and Alexis Sánchez in January, says Arsène Wenger\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Olivier Giroud also has a nice choice to make.

Sorry Olivier. \nManchester City don’t need to watch Arsenal to know they like Alexis Sánchez. They’re confident they could get the Chilean in January for around £20m. But they may have an even better option: because news from Catalonia is that Lionel Messi might actually fancy a move to City now that they’re steamrollering everyone in the league. That’s a challenge that Messi can relate to. But he hasn’t yet made his mind up and would welcome hearing precisely how much Barcelona want him to stay, especially in the wake of the departure of Neymar. Talk of an £80m bonus for signing a new deal might also add up to a compelling project. \nLeicester are planning to signal their intent to climb out of the Premier League basement by signing … the 34-year-old free agent Bacary Sagna. Shucks, they might as well raid Sunderland while they’re at it: word is Ellis Short will listen to offers for his most valuable players if he doesn’t manage to offload the entire club pronto. For the avoidance of doubt, yes, Sunderland do have some valuable players. Didier Ndong, Lamine Koné, the list goes at least that far. \nWest Brom hope that Grzegorz Krychowiak will perform a tricky balancing act, playing well enough to help them have a good season this season but not so well that better clubs will want to buy him when Paris Saint-Germain put him up for a permanent transfer next summer.

Mourinho was particularly unhappy, stating his players’ attitude was poorer than for even a friendly under him. After seeing Herrera’s interview immediately after the match Mourinho said all his players should publicly explain themselves. His side host Tottenham Hotspur in Saturday’s early game, with the north London side level with United on 20 points, but he is sure the attitude at Huddersfield was an aberration.\n“To play badly and lose matches, I think that can happen again,” Mourinho said. “It happens during a season. You cannot play well all the time; you cannot win all the time; you cannot even be lucky all the time. So to lose again, I think it is going to happen but in terms of the attitude that we didn’t like and knowing the players and what good people they are, I believe it was an isolated case.”\n\n\n\n\nManchester United v Tottenham Hotspur: match preview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsked if he had taken exception to Herrera’s words, he said: “I was surprised but happy because it is not easy for the players to recognise and admit.

So, contrary to imaginary sources that tell you everything we do here, I can promise you that since the match I have not spoken one word, or spent a single second talking about that match. There is no need.”\nMourinho was also dismissive of claims made in Mauricio Pochettino’s book, Brave New World, that he had a “compromising” conversation with Eric Dier after United beat Spurs 1-0 at Old Trafford last season. Pochettino writes that Dier told him Mourinho had been interested in signing him since the previous summer.\n“If it is Mauricio’s words or it is his ghost writer’s, I really don’t know,” Mourinho said. “What I do know, is that every season, during the summer, before every season he calls me and I call Mauricio and we ask about each other’s players to see if they are available or not. I don’t know why I should speak to Dier on a football match day in the tunnel, maybe it is to try and sell books. Maybe his ghost writer wants to make some money. I just have a very good relationship with him. He’s one of the guys I’ve known for many years and we’ve always had a very good relationship.”\nPochettino wrote: “Mourinho and I had finished our interviews at Old Trafford and the players were doing their warm-down. When José was done with the press, he stood by the entrance to the tunnel and regarded the returning players.\n“He greeted Moussa Sissoko and hugged Dier. They passed by me en route to the dressing rooms, laughing, speaking in Portuguese. Maybe it is a common Mourinho tactic but he put Eric in a compromising position.

He always says hello.’ As for the Mourinho incident, ‘What could I have done?’ Eric asked me. He [Dier] told me about United’s interest since last summer [2016] and I explained the situation to him clearly.\n“Ever since that conversation, Eric admits that he could have waited for Mourinho to be out of sight before heading to the dressing room.”\nMourinho claimed on Friday he always wanted to sign Nemanja Matic, who joined from Chelsea in the summer, ahead of Dier. “I have the player that I really wanted to have, probably I have the player I didn’t think it was possible to have but we got the player I really wanted,” he said.\nMourinho added he was more concerned that the injured Marouane Fellaini sign a new deal than Luke Shaw do so. Fellaini’s terms expire in the summer. “I’m worried about Fellaini and not about Luke Shaw, because Fellaini finishes his contract and Luke Shaw doesn’t,” he said.\n"

The 22-year-old fears he will not be given a meaningful first-team chance again.\n\n\n\n\nJesse Lingard double has Manchester United strolling past Swansea City\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShaw was part of United’s squad on the pre-season tour of the US, where he followed his own training regime as he recovered from ankle ligament damage. The defender, who made his England debut in 2014, was intent on forcing his way back into Mourinho’s plans but the manager does not feel Shaw has done enough to merit a return to the starting XI since achieving full fitness.\nShaw has featured only twice this season, as a replacement in the Carabao Cup. The second of those appearances came in Tuesday’s 2-0 win at Swansea City. Yet Shaw was allowed only four minutes by Mourinho, who preferred to start Axel Tuanzebe, a 19-year-old who had yet to feature this term and had previously made five career appearances.\nShaw is considering his options, though it is thought a move as early as January, on a permanent basis at least, is unlikely.\nIn April Mourinho openly questioned Shaw’s ability, saying the player was far behind team-mates and that even a place on the bench was difficult to justify. After Shaw failed to be named as a substitute for a 0-0 draw with West Bromwich Albion on 1 April, Mourinho said: “I cannot compare the way he trains, the way he commits, the focus, the ambition. I cannot compare. He is a long way behind.”\nShaw was signed in 2014 for £27m, then a world-record fee for a teenager. Yet on that summer’s tour of the US, Mourinho’s predecessor, Louis van Gaal, claimed Shaw was overweight, and the former Southampton defender then suffered a succession of injuries.\nThe worst of these was a double leg break in September 2015 at PSV Eindhoven which ruled him out for the rest of the season.\nShaw returned last season but made only 20 appearances, the last in a 1-1 draw with Swansea on 30 April before he suffered ankle ligament damage.\n"

        "text": "\nCristiano Ronaldo has always loved Manchester United. We know this because he left the club to spend his peak years elsewhere, and now that they are over, is looking to return. The likelihood is that three Champions Leagues and three Ballon d’Ors later, he has at last come to acknowledge the famous saying that “when you leave United, the only way is down”, and as such has instructed Jorge Mendes to negotiate his back passage; strike that, reverse it; his passage back.\n\n\n\n\nMilan’s Donnarumma has fake money thrown at him in Under-21 match for Italy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuite what caused this sudden and remarkable change of heart is unclear, but the deal is also expected to include Álvaro Morata, with David de Gea moving in the opposite direction. For this, United will pay a round £183m, though Ed Woodward is doing all he can to increase the fee; Real Madrid will use the money to buy Antonio Valencia, Gabriel Obertan, Michael Owen and the boy Mame BiramDiouf.\nShould United succeed in selling the world’s best goalkeeper for roughly £3.62, they plan to bring in Gianluigi Donnarumma to replace him, a development that will have few opponents should it bring the seminal work of Paul Young to English terraces. Donnarumma has, it seems, burnt his bridges at Milan by hankering for a better job that pays him more money; on Sunday, a “Dollarumma” sign was displayed behind his goal during the Italy-Denmark game at the European Under-21 Championships, and play was briefly suspended when a load of fake dollar bills were thrown into his goal. The Mill understands that those responsible were grown adults. \nElsewhere, Chelsea are looking to add to their plucky squad of incredibly expensive and talented underdogs. Permitted to spend a mere £112.88m last summer, Antonio Conte is ensuring against such appalling parsimony this, refusing to sign a new contract until things are as he would like them. In particular, he would like Alex Sandro from Juventus, deemed an upgrade on Marcus Alonso, and Tiemoué Bakayoko from Monaco, a proven expert in conceding possession in dangerous areas. \nLiverpool, meanwhile, are still haggling with Roma over Mohamed Salah, who moved to Italy less than a year ago for “just” £15, but one half-decent season later, is apparently worth more than double that. A bid of £28m was rejected earlier this month, but it is thought that a deal has now been done for £35m; on Sunday, a friend of the player “took to Facebook” to wish him luck at Anfield, and there can be no more compelling evidence than that. \n\n\n\n\nChelsea to step up efforts to sign Alex Sandro and Tiemoué Bakayoko\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcross Stanley Park, the People’s Club continue to chuck money at Evertonians who are born not made; last week, £55m or so was spent on Jordan Pickford and Davy Klaassen, and this week Sandro Ramí­rez will join from Málaga. Nor is Ronald Koeman finished there. Though he retains his disgust at the venality of a system in which Romelu Lukaku can want to further his career by leaving Goodison, he has charitably suspended it with regard to those he’d like to arrive, so has asked the club to pursue Swansea City’s Gylfi Sigurdsson, Burnley’s Michael Keane, and Milan’s M’Baye Niang. \nFinally, Southampton are keen on Tottenham’s reserve centre-back, Kevin Wimmer. Though doubts persist about his ability to defend, this would at least make the headline “Wimmer’s Way” more likely, and for that we can only be grateful. \n"

        "text": "\nManchester United really, really want to sign Álvaro Morata, because he’s dead good. At a mere £50m he’s also – and this is important, because after all United have debt to service – cheaper than their other potential line-leading frontman recruits, Everton’s £100m-rated (by Everton) Romelu Lukaku and Torino’s Andrea Belotti (who has just scored more than 20 goals in a season for the first time, so that’ll be £87m please), though Alexandre Lacazette could emerge as an alternative. Real Madrid’s Spanish bench-warmer could end up England-bound as part of a complicated player/cash/other-stuff exchange deal also involving gifted gloveman David de Gea, though Morata himself says he’s perfectly happy in Madrid for the time being. As for Lacazette, he yesterday issued perhaps the football world’s most feeble come-and-get-me plea to English clubs: “The Premier League is interesting,” he enthused. “That does not mean I will go, and that does not mean I will refuse to go.”\n\n\n\n\nVirgil van Dijk tells Liverpool he wants to join them from Southampton\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile a Morata-De Gea swaperoo remains a possibility United have to identify potential replacements for their current goalkeeper. According to the Mail, “they have the likes of Manchester City’s Joe Hart on a list of names that also includes some from abroad with Gianluigi Donnarumma of Milan and Inter’s Samir Handanovic also discussed”. The same newspaper believes that United are interested in Renato Sanches, who doesn’t appear to be as good as Bayern Munich thought he was going to be but about whom José Mourinho enthusiastically gushed last summer, while his fellow Allianz Arena flop Douglas Costa is a £30m target for Tottenham and Juventus.\nMorata might be happier to flee the Bernabéu should Real complete a mooted record-smashing €135m deal for another striker, Monaco’s Kylian Mbappé, which would effectively relegate him to third choice behind the young Frenchman and the older Frenchman Karim Benzema and would also frustrate Arsenal, who were just about ready to demonstrate their financial might with a meaty €100m bid. Arsène Wenger and Ivan Gazidis, Arsenal’s chief executive, set tongues a-wagging when they were spotted at Nice airport – just an hour’s drive away from Monaco, and that’s if you take the scenic coastal route – on Monday.\nVirgil van Dijk’s future dominates today’s papers, with the Sun reporting that “Jürgen Klopp is convinced he will beat Manchester City and Chelsea” to the Dutchman, the Mirror announcing that it was the German’s “charisma and enthusiasm” that ensured “Liverpool have won their heavyweight scrap”, and even this newspaper joining in, declaring the Reds have been “informed by the Southampton defender that Anfield is his preferred destination”. Now all Liverpool need to do is actually table a bid for him, and for it to be accepted. Which given that Southampton aren’t terribly keen on selling would appear to be a significant obstacle, though the offer of Mamadou Sakho in part-exchange might help. According to the Independent, Van Dijk and the Roma winger Mohamed Salah will be the first two bricks in a large transfer wall for Liverpool, who by the time they’re finished hope to have signed seven new players. Happily the report contains the word “bumper”.\nCeltic may say that Moussa Dembélé is not for sale, or at least not yet, but Milan want to test their resolve. According to the Daily Record, “Milan bosses held an informal meeting with Dembélé’s representatives a month ago, but are now looking to arrange a follow-up discussion.” Should that meeting go well, all the Italian giants would then have to do is actually table a bid for him, and for it to be accepted, though the same paper believes Chelsea and Borussia Dortmund are the Frenchman’s most likely destinations.\n\n\n\n\nFootball transfer rumours: Alexandre Lacazette heading for Liverpool?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTalking of Chelsea, Eden Hazard’s ankle injury might convince them to seek another creative attacking genius, even though the Belgian won’t be out all that long and would have been on holiday for much of that time anyway. Real’s James Rodríguez, almost certain to move somewhere this summer, is apparently an option, while Ángel Di María’s name might also crop up.\nOn his way out of Stamford Bridge meanwhile is the juvenile goal machine Tammy Abraham, who seems set to take his shooting boots to Newcastle, after Rafael Benítez convinced both the player and his parent club that they could look after him better than rival bidders Brighton. Benítez, says the Telegraph, will now turn his attention to sorting out the opposite end of his team, with a move for the recently-released Manchester City shot-stopper Willy Caballero looking likely.\n"

        "text": "\nThe front page of today’s A Bola carries shock news that will send Europe’s biggest and richest clubs into a frenzy: “Cristiano Ronaldo wants to leave Spain!” they squeal. “The decision is irreversible and he has already told the Real Madrid president”. It seems the player is “outraged” by the charges of criminal tax fraud that have landed on his doorstep this week and is planning to take his revenge by personally snubbing their country of origin. Manchester United and Paris Saint-Germain could both be interested in sealing a – deep breath – £157m deal for the 32-year-old.\n\n\n\nolhaoquete2igo \n(@olhaoquete2igo)\nABOLA - 16/06 #RealMadrid pic.twitter.com/iAt1viuWgD\n\nJune 16, 2017\n\n\nIf he does take the former option he wouldn’t be the only Portuguese player moving to Manchester, with the £15m-rated Benfica midfielder/striker Anderson Talisca also on his way to the club, according to Anderson Talisca. “I’ve had a good season and Mourinho has a love for me,” he roars in the Mirror. “I will not lie. His love is old and I like his work. He’s a great coach and I hope everything works out. My representatives are dealing with the situation. Soon, they’ll have news.” The good news is that United still have Benfica on speed dial, having sealed a deal for Victor Lindelof on Wednesday. The bad news is that they signed Lindelof, not Talisca.\nIvan Perisic is also on his way to Manchester United, according to “sources close to the player” and the Manchester Evening News, who reveal that the Croatian midfield schemer “appreciates” and “enjoys” Mourinho’s management skills – which is another way of saying he didn’t watch much of United last season – and would be happy to leave Internazionale. Fortuitously, Mourinho also appreciates Perisic, and “a source close to the potential move” has told the Mail that despite a hefty £44m asking price “we’re looking at it going through within weeks”.\n\n\n\n\nEverton kick off spending spree with Jordan Pickford and Davy Klaassen signings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd the Mill’s final United update of the day concerns their negotiations with Álvaro Morata, with whom they have apparently agreed a massive £350,000 a week contract. This adds up to a little over £90m over the course of a five-year deal, which given that they may end up paying a £90m fee for the player – though £78m might do it, according to some papers – amounts to a £180m outlay, for a player who started 41% of Real Madrid’s league games last season, and only one of 13 in the Champions League. Meanwhile Arsenal are ready to send Olivier Giroud to Monaco if it will help them take Kylian Mbappé in the other direction. Which it won’t, because he’s going to Madrid.\nTottenham have joined the chase for Lazio’s Keita Baldé, the £30m-rated, 22-year-old forward who also figures prominently on the Everton and Liverpool shopping lists, according to the Mirror. The player “is understood to be holding out for a move to Juventus”, but should his desires turn out to be unrequited a rival suitor could swoop. Meanwhile Chelsea are ready to hand Napoli all the loose change jangling around their purse – some £52.5m once you add it all up – for Kalidou Koulibaly, who they tried to sign last summer and are ready to bid for again. Asked about the speculation, Koulibaly’s agent apparently said: “Chelsea? I don’t want to talk about this now.” \nM’Baye Niang, the French forward who starred very sporadically while on loan from Milan to Watford last season, could soon make a permanent move to England – though to Merseyside, rather than Hertfordshire. Sources spotted him at Everton’s Finch Farm training ground on Thursday, and a £15.7m transfer could now be sealed within days.\nWatford hope to boost their Niangless creative ranks with the signing of the Liverpool winger Lazar Markovic, who worked with their new manager, Marco Silva, at Hull last season with some success. They will have to fight off Zenit St Petersburg and “clubs in Portugal”, according to the Sun, who assert that Markovic is “one of a handful of fringe men Jürgen Klopp will look to flog” this summer. The bad news for the Hornets is that this will be no bargain buy: they may scarcely have played him, they may be looking to flog him, but Liverpool want £20m for him anyway.\n"

        "text": "\nManchester United are watching the Cristiano Ronaldo show with renewed interest after the Real Madrid striker made it plain he is “outraged” at what he feels is unfair treatment by tax authorities and is now determined to leave Spain.\nThe 32-year-old feels he is being singled out for disproportionate treatment after prosecutors accused him of defrauding the authorities of €14.7m. A source close to the player claims the “outraged” Portugal international “feels great indignation” following the public speculation about his tax affairs and a sense of “injustice” at the allegations – which he contests – and he has made a decision to leave the country.\nRonaldo, who signed a new five-year contract in November, has made no secret of his affection for United – the club he left to join Madrid in 2009 after six years at Old Trafford – and José Mourinho, who shares the same super agent Jorge Mendes, would relish his return as he seeks to build a team capable of a title challenge and a successful campaign in the Champions League.\n\n\n\n\nCristiano Ronaldo: Portugal pair give backing to captain amid speculation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnited remain one of the clubs with the financial muscle to offer a competitive package for Ronaldo – they are predicting record revenues of up to £570m this year – and his return would be a dream commercial move.\nHe has a €1bn (£880m) release clause in his current Madrid deal and United – now without Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s wages on the books and the potential to lose Wayne Rooney’s financial burden soon – would be able to meet Ronaldo’s wage demands of around £400,000 a week. Paris Saint-Germain could match United’s offer but the Old Trafford move presents Ronaldo with his fairytale moment and a far grander stage on which to perform. The potential availability of one of the world’s most marketable players will also naturally alert the Chinese Super League clubs.\nReports that Ronaldo wanted to leave Real were sparked on Friday in the Portuguese newspaper A Bola. It claimed his decision was “irreversible” and that he has already told his Madrid team-mates that he wants to leave.\nThe root of Ronaldo’s anger stems from Spanish prosecutors’ lawsuit against the player, accusing him of defrauding tax authorities of €14.7m by hiding his image rights income between 2011 and 2014. Ronaldo has categorically denied any wrongdoing. Real backed that assertion, saying they were confident the Portuguese forward had acted legally.\nFollowing the tax allegations, Ronaldo posted a picture of himself with his fingers to his lips on Instagram with the caption: “Sometimes the best answer it’s to be quiet.”\nEarlier this week Ronaldo’s agency Gestifute released a statement which read: “There is no tax evasion scheme ... There has never been any hiding nor any intention to hide anything.”\nRonaldo’s frustrations at his treatment come after leading Real to three Champions League titles, scoring twice in last month’s final against Juventus in Cardiff as they became the first club to retain the trophy. He also became only the second player to score in three different finals and remains the competition’s record goalscorer with 105.\nBarcelona’s Lionel Messi took a similar stance in threatening to quit Spain in 2014, also claiming he had been singled out for special treatment, when he was accused of concealing €4.1m from the authorities. The Argentina international was found guilty and subsequently lost an appeal against a 21-month prison sentence – under Spanish law sentences under two years are usually suspended – and a €2.1m (£1.8m) fine.\n"

United are second in the Premier League to Manchester City by two points, top their Champions League group after two matches with a maximum six points and continue their defence of the EFL Cup next week at Swansea City.\nThe team remain unbeaten and their form and style of play have been the most impressive in the four years since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in May 2013. United have recorded four 4-0 wins in the league and conceded only two goals – the division’s best defensive record. There have also been two 4-1 victories, in the EFL Cup and Champions League.\n\n\n\n\nJuan Mata: ‘People underestimate football.

Despite the French club’s ongoing interest and the Portuguese’s admiration for them, Mourinho remains content at United and currently has no wish to leave for PSG or anywhere else.\n"

        "text": "\nManchester United seemed destined for an unwanted replay before Jesse Lingard again took responsibility, scoring a superb eighth goal in his past 10 appearances with six minutes remaining, which was followed by Romelu Lukaku sealing the win at the end of normal time.\nJosé Mourinho’s side had appeared unable to kill off Derby County, as towards the close Marcus Rashford crashed the ball off the right post, Lukaku’s header hit the left, and Paul Pogba missed a sitter. Yet Lingard’s swerving long-range shot showed them how to do it and so United move on content.\n\n\n\n\nAntonio Conte says José Mourinho has memory problem in fierce attack on rival\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf Lingard, whose season tally is now 11, the manager said: “He is in a clear evolution. He’s comfortable in the position he plays, improving with the progressive style of the team, which makes him feel even more like a fish in the water. He’s the opposite of Marcus because Marcus scores unbelievable goals in training and missed unbelievable chances in games. I’m not worried with Marcus because his good moment will arrive. Jesse won’t lose his stability. He’s mature, he understands the game better.”\nMourinho made five changes, drafting in Sergio Romero, Daley Blind, Chris Smalling, Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Rashford. Gary Rowett’s XI showed six different personnel from their previous match, the 1-1 draw with Sheffield United, with Tom Lawrence, Andre Wisdom, Alex Pearce, Sam Winnall, Marcus Olsson and George Thorne all selected.\nUnited made a crisp start. Luke Shaw and Pogba moved the ball along the left. The Frenchman beat a Derby defender and switched possession to Lingard, who should have scored, instead lifting the shot over Scott Carson’s goal.\nYet following a flurry of United chances, the visitors stroked the ball around. Lawrence, the No10 in Rowett’s 4-2-3-1, broke up the middle and reversed play to Winnall but the centre-forward was stymied. The contest had an attractive flow. Lingard and Mkhitaryan put Rashford in and after a trick to create space the striker missed a glaring chance to open the scoring. Mata’s free-kick was saved well by Carson to his right and from the ensuing corner United found themselves back-pedalling. Mkhitaryan took this short and suddenly Shaw was passing back towards the centre-circle.\nWhen the ball found its way to Johnny Russell he coasted down the left and found Martin Olsson’s head, the left-back forcing Romero to tip over. As the half-hour approached United became sloppy. Mkhitaryan gifted possession to Derby, Winnall raced forward and the Armenian was fortunate to see the attack fizzle out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Scott Carson stretches to save Juan Mata’s free-kick. Photograph: Jason Cairnduff/Action Images via Reuters\n\n\nThe same was true of United’s initial momentum: their display had flattened and they were now vulnerable. The lack of ruthlessness Mourinho can bemoan was evident when a Rashford glancing header from Mkhitaryan’s ball hit Carson’s left post. The No19 was at close range so had no excuse for missing. It was a repeat story when Mata picked him out and he could only head straight at the keeper.\nAs the interval neared United kept pressing. A Pogba free-kick drew “oohs” from the home support as Carson saved sharply to his right. Yet at the break the tie remained deadlocked.\nMourinho believed a change was required so Lukaku, who missed the win at Everton due to a head injury, replaced Mkhitaryan for the second half. The Belgian took his customary No9 berth, Rashford moved left and Lingard went in behind Lukaku.\nDerby, though, made the brighter start. A Lawrence free-kick from the right found Tom Huddlestone who was unlucky not to score with a shot. From here United mounted a first attack of the period. Pogba and Lukaku combined and when the latter lost the ball he quickly claimed it back. Up stepped Herrera whose attempt was deflected for a corner.\nThis enlivened United. Pogba dug a route into Derby’s area and when the ball arrived at Mata’s feet he pulled the trigger and Carson beat the ball away. The passage reflected United’s dominance at the start of the contest.\n\n\n\n\nVirgil van Dijk crowns Liverpool debut to see off Everton in Cup derby\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Rashford corner from the left found Lukaku’s head but he could not direct it and the same player’s cross moments later was missed completely by Mata’s head.\nAll of this illustrated a troubling lack of requisite quality in the danger area and when Lawrence fired at Romero, who dived to his right, this was as accomplished as anything United had produced.\nMourinho’s men quickened the tempo yet a hint of desperation remained. Rowett brought on Matej Vydra for Winnall and Derby’s manager may have seen a credible replay move into sight. But Lukaku’s second confirmed victory and a potential warm weather break in Dubai.\nAccording to Mourinho, this rests on Stoke City not drawing with Coventry City in their tie as United are due to face them on Monday week. If the Potters do have a replay then United’s league meeting with Mark Hughes’s side is moved to Saturday week and may curtail or even mean there is no trip.\n"

Since then United have beaten Everton 4-0, Burton Albion 4-1, Southampton 1-0 and CSKA Moscow 4-1 before the victory over Roy Hodgson’s bottom-placed side.\n\n\n\n\nMarouane Fellaini double sinks Crystal Palace as Manchester United march on\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlong with Pogba, Mourinho is also missing Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Marcos Rojo and Michael Carrick, and the manager had been without Phil Jones and Marouane Fellaini for the trip to CSKA.\nYet Mourinho said: “When we moan all the time about injuries it looks like we don’t trust the other people and we have to. We never miss the players that are injured, that’s our way of seeing. They are injured, we don’t think about them. It’s an opportunity for others, is a moment for others to step up and to get the chance, so I think that’s good.”\nUnited’s sixth win from seven league outings kept them in second place, only behind Manchester City by a goal difference of one. This is Mourinho’s second season in charge of United and he has previously won the championship in the second term of all of the clubs he has managed.\nYet asked if he can see similarities between United and those other title-winning teams, he said: “It’s too early. Seven matches. It’s too early.”\nJuan Mata, who scored the opener against Palace, echoed Mourinho’s view. “We need to try to focus on each game and not think farther,” the Spaniard said. “We are happy with the start of the season, we cannot lie. And we arrive at the international break in a very good moment, scoring a lot of goals, not conceding in different competitions, so we know we have a good start but as well the manager is telling us all the time, and we know it, that it’s just the beginning and we need to keep calm.”\nWhile that was Mata’s opening goal of the season, Fellaini took his tally to four by registering twice against Palace. Romelu Lukaku completed the scoring to make it 12 in 10 appearances since the Belgian signed for £75m from Everton in the summer.\nIn all, United have scored 21 times in the league and 32 in all competitions. Last year they lacked a cutting edge in front of goal and Mata is unsure what has changed.\nHe said: “We are being more efficient. We are not training more on finishing than last season; it’s just down to confidence. Maybe it’s true that last season Zlatan was scoring almost every game and we tried to help with some goals but he was very responsible for our attack and this season everyone seems to enjoy the offensive duties. I don’t know the reason. It’s just – we are putting the ball in the back of the net.”\nOf Lukaku, Mata said: “It’s a lot of goals, especially when you come to a new environment. I knew he would score a lot but I didn’t know he would do it so quick, that’s true. He gives a lot more to the team, too, but for a striker it’s important to score, especially when you see other strikers are scoring.\n“I believe that is what he feels and he’s a good lad, a very humble lad and everyone likes him in the dressing room, so we are happy for him.”\nAfter the international break United travel to Liverpool. Last year’s corresponding fixture was a 0-0 draw but Mourinho insisted he has yet to plan for the match.\n“I didn’t even think about it, I just ended this game,” the 54-year-old said. “I’m not even thinking about Liverpool, I can promise you that; I didn’t have a second to think about the Liverpool game.”\n"

        "text": "\nIf nothing else, Liverpool should probably take it as a compliment that Manchester United would choose to approach the game this way. It was the second successive season this fixture has ended goalless and it did not need a suspicious mind to deduce that José Mourinho had decided that would be enough to make it a satisfying day – and to hell with anyone who might question his lack of adventure.\nHis team had averaged three goals a game from their previous seven Premier League fixtures but this was the first time they had faced a side in the top-12 places. Mourinho altered his tactics accordingly and the second half, in particular, was an exercise in defensive parsimony directly in front of the Kop. Liverpool were unable to break them down and Mourinho has already made it clear what he thinks about the people who might blame him for ruining games as a spectacle. For the story of this match, refer to what he said after last season’s Europa League final against Ajax: “There are lots of poets in football, but poets don’t win many titles.”\n\n\n\n\nJosé Mourinho defends Manchester United tactics after Anfield stalemate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe tends to know what he is doing but it was a risky strategy and it would have been intriguing to see Mourinho’s back-up plan if one of those Liverpool attacks had found a way behind United’s defence.\nInstead, the home side did not have the wit or creativity in decisive areas and, unfortunately for Jürgen Klopp, three points have never been awarded for moral victories. Liverpool have won only one of their last eight games in the various competitions and it all seemed rather flat at the end. “What did José Mourinho say?” Klopp wanted to know. “That we were the more defensive side? That would have been funny.”\nMourinho has heard it all before and will reflect on a job well done, no matter how much it grates with him when he is accused of putting together teams that do not play the classic United way. They did not manage a single noteworthy attack in the second half but the most extraordinary statistic of the afternoon was that it was not until the 17th minute that Romelu Lukaku managed a touch of the ball.\nLukaku is often accused of lacking his best work in the more challenging assignments but his failure to score here owed more to the circumstances. The Belgium striker had one chance in the first-half when he aimed his shot too close to the Liverpool goalkeeper, Simon Mignolet, but he was isolated for most of the game and perhaps there was a measure of frustration in the challenge that sent Joe Gomez flying close to the touchline.\nInstead this was an afternoon where Phil Jones and Chris Smalling demonstrated their improvement under Mourinho, Lukaku could be seen helping out in defence, Anthony Martial spent most of the game inside his own half and in the one moment of old-fashioned excitement there was another reminder about David de Gea’s extraordinary ability to prevent the ball from going into his net.\nAnfield was already rising to its feet when Roberto Firmino deceived Nemanja Matic inside the penalty area and Joël Matip reached the cross first. The Liverpool defender made a solid connection, eight yards out, but in that split second De Gea was already adjusting his body, jutting out his left foot to block the shot on the goal-line. It was an exceptional piece of improvisational goalkeeping and when De Gea rose to his feet he still did not have a hair out of place. What an incredible keeper he has become.\n\n\n \n\n\nPlay Video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n2:21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  José Mourinho and Jürgen Klopp react to Anfield stalemate – video\n\n\nThat apart, there was not a great amount of penalty-area activity during a first half that was far too hectic to expect either side to pass the ball with their normal accuracy. Mohamed Salah showed, in flashes, some lovely, deft touches but there was so little time on the ball, with a challenge never too far away, it was difficult to build possession. Both sides were guilty of not taking enough care of the ball and perhaps that was inevitable when everything was so fast and furious.\n\n\n\n\nLiverpool 0-0 Manchester United: Premier League - as it happened\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second half was a more controlled affair, with Liverpool pressing forward, forcing a succession of corners but without ever giving the impression they were wearing down their opponents. Klopp’s men played many passes, but never the killer one. Gomez came the closest with a clipped pass into Emre Can’s path but the German’s shot went into the Kop and, after that, there were only sporadic moments when De Gea was threatened again.\nMourinho brought on another centre-half, Victor Lindelof, in the final exchanges for Ashley Young, a converted defender playing here as a right winger, and the game huffed and puffed to its end under the glare of the autumnal sun. It was the first time ever there have been back-to-back 0-0 draws in this fixture and Klopp was asked afterwards if he would ever set up a team in the way that Mourinho had. “You could not play this way at Liverpool,” he replied, “but it’s OK for Manchester United.”\n"

        "text": "\nThe only good news for Roy Hodgson was that his second visit to Manchester in a week did not result in another 5-0 scoreline. It could have done but Manchester United were not exactly going flat out here. There was simply no need. That is the bad news for stricken Crystal Palace. There is so much of it that it is hard to know where to start.\nProbably the third minute, by which time United had taken the lead and the visiting manager was already staring glassy-eyed into space in the manner perfected with England last summer.\nA sublime turn by Marcus Rashford on the left wing had sent Joel Ward so far in the wrong direction that the Palace full-back practically had to pay to get back in, and left free to cut in along the goalline the England forward had the time and composure to look up and find Juan Mata waiting near the penalty spot for a goal to mark his 200th Premier League appearance.\nIn truth the game went a bit flat after such a sparkling start, with Palace doing their damage limitation work well and keeping two disciplined defensive lines behind the ball. It took United half an hour to find a way through, though when they did the danger again came from the left. This time it was Ashley Young in an advanced position, easily avoiding Andros Townsend’s token resistance to send over a cross to the far post, where Marouane Fellaini was able to sweep in a close-range volley.\nPalace made it to the interval without further mishap, yet in the 10 first-half minutes that remained after Fellaini’s goal United could easily have doubled their lead. Rashford struck a post just before the break, but the passage of play that best summed up the task facing Hodgson came a couple of minutes earlier, when Townsend needlessly conceded a corner because he could not find a team-mate to help him out, and Chris Smalling missed the target at the far post with a free header from Mata’s cross. All Palace had managed by way of attack in the first period was a shot from their stand-in striker Bakary Sako that David de Gea beat away, though it was significant that even when United made mistakes at the back, such as the clearance from the goalkeeper that went straight to Jeffrey Schlupp, their opponents were too timid to take advantage.\nHodgson’s second half began as badly as his first, with whatever he had said to his players in the dressing room rendered irrelevant by the free-kick Rashford arrowed into the area for Fellaini to score his second with a header on the six-yard line. Wayne Hennessey had to get down low to stop Young adding a fourth a few minutes later, after Palace had rather dozily allowed the left back to arrive unchallenged in the area to accept a short corner.\nAny semblance of a contest over, the only questions that remained as the game went into its final half hour were whether Palace might manage their first goal of the season and whether Romelu Lukaku could break Louis Saha’s record by scoring in each of his first seven league games. One of those possibilities seemed much more likely than the other, but Lukaku seemed to have missed his big chance when the ball broke to him off Jesse Lingard and he put a low shot the wrong side of a post, with the crowd so confident of his finishing prowess a goal was already being acclaimed.\nThat left Palace a window of opportunity but though Townsend went close with a free-kick from a long way out, it was not that close and Lukaku had the last laugh when Ander Herrera and Anthony Martial presented him with an unmissable chance five minutes from time.\nSo United ended up visiting the top of the table after scoring four for a fourth time in September, while pointless and goalless Palace must sit out the international break on the bottom with Chelsea to come when Premier League fixtures resume.\nIt is perfectly true, as Hodgson pointed out, that a team in Palace’s position is bound to miss players of the calibre of Wilfried Zaha and Christian Benteke, though at the end of a one-sided game one was left wondering what the chasm between the sides might have been like had United been able to call upon Paul Pogba and not had a Champions League trip to Moscow in midweek.\n“We’re Crystal Palace, we score when we want,” was the defiant chant from the travelling supporters. If only it were true.\n"

It means some all-too familiar faces keep the Mill churning at this time of year and one is them is Alex Sandro, the Juventus wing-back, whom Chelsea remain terribly keen on signing in the new year. Juve had the temerity to knock back bid after bid during the summer; they probably won’t make the same grievous error again and good old Premier League brute force looks likely to win out in short-ish order.\nAlexis Sánchez has kept the Mill fed and watered for an entire summer, so when no bigger an authority than Dani Alves says “it’s possible” that the Arsenal forward might join Paris Saint-Germain, we thrill in the subsequent column inches while crossing our fingers that it doesn’t actually happen for a good while yet.\n\n\n\n\nBarcelona chief executive talks up January bid for Philippe Coutinho\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow for a dispatch from Manchester United, where Anthony Martial’s good recent form may not be enough to make him a pawn in their plot to sign Ivan Rakitic from Barcelona. He could be offered up by José Mourinho as particularly flavoursome bait in order that the Croatia playmaker might be freed up to buccaneer up at Old Trafford.\nYou might recall another time and place where Mourinho was quite willing to get shot of Juan Mata. He doesn’t want to make that mistake twice and instead will reward the midfielder’s rejection of a huge-money move to China – club unspecified, although that minor detail would doubtless have followed – by triggering an extra year on his United contract.

Rafa Benítez also retains an interest in long-time target Dennis Praet, the Sampdoria midfielder and sometime Belgium international.\nWhat hope to Crystal Palace have of avoiding the drop? Perhaps a little more if they go back in for Cenk Tosun, the Besiktas and Turkey striker whom Frank de Boer – remember him? – tried and failed to do a deal for in August. Coincidentally Roy Hodgson has exactly the same target in mind and would be super-keen on getting it wrapped up when the window opens. It may be too late by then – or Tottenham may firm up some tentative interest and, should it be at all possible, darken the clouds hanging over Selhurst Park.\n"

        "text": "\nJosé Mourinho ended up being sent to the stands in stoppage time, though this was still the kind of victory to make him purr. Manchester United are enjoying their best start to a campaign in six years even if a contest they had initially threatened to dominate, bullying their hosts into submission, went on to become a far sterner test of their resilience. Southampton rallied impressively after the interval and it was the visitors who were left clinging on, though their manager will still have delighted in rugged success.\nMourinho has always valued wins that have to be chiselled out and orchestrated shrewdly from the bench. He had flung on Chris Smalling and resorted to a back five before the end in an attempt to contain the hosts, Mauricio Pellegrino having exhausted his own team’s firepower from the bench. Even Fraser Forster ventured upfield at a set-piece while Mourinho was still shaking the hands of Southampton’s coaching staff having been sent to the stands, apparently for encroaching on to the pitch.\nThe final whistle would have sounded by the time he returned to the dressing room, leaving him to praise his team as “solid, with good solidarity, organisation and spirit, and amazing points”.\n\n\n\n\nÁlvaro Morata strikes treble for Chelsea in crushing defeat of Stoke\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt felt a significant win. Those around second-place United secured more riotous successes on Saturday but, in the manner it was achieved, this was arguably as impressive a result. Retreat to last season and United might have wilted, shipping an equaliser to record another of those horribly wasteful and familiar score draws. As it is they are four points better off than at the same stage last season having demonstrated they can scintillate or grind out results dependent upon the occasion. Phil Jones and Eric Bailly flung themselves at anything that moved, while Nemanja Matic and Marouane Fellaini offered a measure of authority in central midfield. Oriol Romeu should still probably have equalised, conjuring two headers and a shot wide of David de Gea’s far post having eased himself clear, but United heaved and succeeded in keeping their opponents blunted.\nThe management will wonder why their initial dominance had been eroded. “What pleased me was the pragmatism, but we were really tired at the end,” said Mourinho. “And nine of them didn’t play in midweek [in the League Cup], so for nine of them it’s not even an accumulation of fatigue. The weather was beautiful and even if you train at 11am, 12pm or 3pm in Manchester we don’t get this weather. Seriously. The last time we had this was in Los Angeles in preseason and then in Macedonia [for the Uefa Super Cup], and I think they felt [it]. I saw some players not sharp.

Photograph: Dylan Martinez/Reuters\n\n\nThat more than justified his late move to five at the back, once Manolo Gabbiadini had been introduced, and six in stoppage time.\nMourinho, sent to the stands against Burnley and West Ham last season, could offer no explanation for his own dismissal. He had been exasperated that too many of his players had ventured upfield on the counter, and appeared to enter the playing area before accidentally bumping into the fourth official, Mike Jones. “Craig [Pawson, the referee] told me to leave, so I left,” he said.\nHe was barely more forthcoming on the travelling support’s insistence on airing that infamous Romelu Lukaku chant once again, following it up with “We’re Man United, we’ll sing what we want”. The only terrace song Mourinho claimed to have heard was one from the Southampton fans telling him where to go, and described the travelling support as “amazing”.\n\n\n\n\nOumar Niasse hits brace from bench to give Everton victory over Bournemouth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnited’s rearguard ended up seeing them home, but Lukaku was their match-winner. The forward had bruised Maya Yoshida and Wesley Hoedt during a one-sided opening period and eventually scored his sixth goal in six Premier League games for his new club midway through the half.\nAshley Young patiently waited to squeeze space from Dusan Tadic on the flank before flinging over a cross to the edge of the six-yard box. Lukaku had already held off Hoedt, the Dutchman crumpling to the turf but not complaining of a foul, and Ryan Bertrand was in no position to choke his header. Forster did well to push that effort out, but the Belgian merely converted the rebound into the empty net.\nSouthampton had appeared fragile at that stage, but will take heart in how they recovered their poise – presumably to the satisfaction of the new owner, Gao Jisheng, who was watching for the first time from the directors’ box – for all that they have now gone scoreless in nine of their past 11 home league matches. They are “getting better”, according to Pellegrino.\nAs are United. “We are better this season than last, but this is nothing,” said Mourinho. “It’s just a start.”\n"

Real Madrid’s Álvaro Morata is another option currently under consideration.\nAtlético, meanwhile, have lost their appeal against a transfer ban that is preventing them from signing players until January 2018. The ban strengthens their need to keep hold of Griezmann but weakens their ability to do so – they will find it far harder to persuade him to stay.\nIf a club pay his €100m (£87m) release clause, Atlético will not be able to do anything to prevent his departure.

Any club who wish to sign him know that if they pay the release clause, the deal can be completed unilaterally.\nGriezmann had hoped to avoid that eventuality, claiming that his future lay in the hands of the Atlético president, Enrique Cerezo. Although it is complex, the clause offers a way of completing a transfer against his wishes, if Griezmann and United are prepared to push that through.\n"

        "text": "\nIf this really was an audition for Europa League final places, then Sergio Romero has confirmed his name on the Manchester United team sheet. Granted only a second Premier League start of the season – in place of the rested David de Gea – the goalkeeper not only saved an early penalty from Manolo Gabbiadini, he kept out everything else Southampton threw at him.\nThere were several eye-catching saves, not least from James Ward-Prowse’s perfectly guided effort on the hour and, having started in each of United’s Europa League knockout ties, Romero has his eyes on the final against Ajax in Stockholm next Wednesday.\n\n\n\n\nJosé Mourinho: Manchester United’s last Premier League game should be moved\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMourinho has said he will start with him and Romero’s CV has certainly come to read well. This was the Argentina international’s 17th appearance of the season in all competitions and his 11th clean sheet. He has been beaten only six times and, when he has featured, United have won 13 and drawn four.\nIt might sound strange for a manager to consider starting his No2 goalkeeper in a European final, particularly given De Gea’s status, and it will raise the inevitable questions about the Spaniard’s future at Old Trafford. Real Madrid continue to cast covetous glances but Mourinho explained his goalkeeping options were not normal and it was not difficult to see why he has such faith in Romero.\n“I don’t go with the ‘if he [De Gea] leaves’ because I hope he doesn’t leave,” Mourinho said. “We need two top goalkeepers and a top young goalkeeper [De Gea] and this is what we have. We have the Spain and Argentina national team goalkeepers and, for me, it’s amazing, especially because of their personal relationship. I never saw two goalkeepers to be so friendly. Everything has gone very smoothly during the season. Everyone was accepting my decisions.”\nIt said everything about United’s performance and ambition that the goalkeeper was by far their best player. It is now certain the club will finish with their lowest number of Premier League wins in a season but Mourinho was more concerned with avoiding injuries before the Ajax final. Worryingly for him, Marouane Fellaini came off with a hamstring problem, which the midfielder assured him was not a tear, while Juan Mata also took a knock.\n“Mata was just contact, no problem at all,” Mourinho said. “Marouane says that, from his experience, he doesn’t think it is a tear. So, trusting in him, he should be OK.”\nClaude Puel had needed a victory given the uncertainly surrounding the Southampton manager’s job prospects and he deserved one on the balance of play. But his team lacked cutting edge and their goal drought at St Mary’s goes on. For the first time in the club’s top-flight history, they have failed to score in four straight home games.\nPuel remains on thin ice and it has reached the point where it would be a surprise if he survived his end-of-season review. It had sounded ominous to hear Ralph Krueger, the chairman, refuse to offer him the slightest of assurances on Tuesday and, equally, it was not a good look when the home crowd jeered his late substitution of Ward-Prowse. There was a smattering of boos from them at full-time.\nPuel’s likely dismissal would look harsh if he finished in eighth position and when it is factored in that he took Southampton to only the sixth major cup final of their history. Even Mourinho admitted they did not deserve to lose the EFL Cup to his team. But the stodginess of Puel’s football has worked against him, even if this was not a bad performance.\nThe penalty was awarded in the fifth minute for a handball against Eric Bailly, even if it looked to have been outside the area, but Romero sprang low to tip away Gabbiadini’s kick. It was Southampton’s third penalty miss in five matches. The first half also featured Bailly working Fraser Forster after a storming run into the box and Anthony Martial dragging wide of the far post.\n\n\n\n\nSouthampton 0-0 Manchester United: Premier League – as it happened\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSouthampton raised the tempo at the start of the second half and Romero distinguished himself further. Dusan Tadic’s free-kick exploded like a shell but Romero beat it away while, shortly afterwards, he did likewise with a low shot from Oriol Romeu, who had been teed up by Nathan Redmond’s cute cutback.\nSouthampton could lament a miscued volley by Jack Stephens at the far post, following a corner, while Romero made his best save to keep out Ward-Prowse’s curler from the edge of the area. His composure throughout was fortifying.\nUnited looked wobbly, their defensive efforts last-ditch but they flickered towards the end. Chris Smalling led a break up the right and, when he crossed, Wayne Rooney held it up before laying off to Mata, who sent his shot high. Martial went the closest for the visitors with a trademark curler for the far corner. It came back off the inside of the post. Victory would have flattered United in the extreme.\n"

        "text": "\nThe six Glazer siblings who own the majority of Manchester United will be paid £18m as a dividend by the club this year, following £15m last year, according to their latest financial statements. The accounts for the three months to 31 March of Manchester United plc confirm the dividend, an annual 18 cents on each share owned, will be paid again in 2016-17.\n\n\n\n\nJosé Mourinho says season will not be failure if Manchester United lose final\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe five sons and one daughter of the late Malcolm Glazer, who bought United with £525m of borrowed money in 2005 and loaded that debt and interest on to the club to repay, own 131m shares, a club spokesman confirmed. The dividend of 18 cents adds up to $23.58m payable to the family which, due to the fall in the value of the pound against the dollar following the referendum vote for Brexit last year, is worth £18.3m. That makes a total of £33m that the family members will have shared in the two years since the dividend was first announced in September 2015.\nThe strength of the dollar had a negative effect on the debt position of Manchester United plc, which is registered in the Cayman Islands tax haven and floated on the New York stock exchange (NYSE). The club’s net debt, still the original Glazer borrowings plus interest, bank charges and professional fees which have cost United more than £700m in the 12 years since the takeover, increased £17.6m last year to £366.3m. The United plc statement to the NYSE said this was entirely due to the fall in the value of the pound, and the actual dollar amount owing remains unchanged.\nUnited, who are sixth in the Premier League but have reached the Europa League final against Ajax, made £127.2m in the quarter, and have increased their projected income over the 2016-17 financial year to £560m-£570m, despite no income from the Champions League this season. The bulk of the enhanced income from 2015-16 is in broadcasting money earned from the Premier League’s new £8.3bn TV deals for the three years from 2016-17, of which United earned £113m in the nine months to 31 March, £20m more than the same period last year.\nDespite that increase, United declared a loss over the period, of £3.8m, with total expenses up £27.6m, including a £10.3m, 18.3% increase in the wage bill to £66.5m for the quarter. United’s spokesman declined to comment on the £18m dividend payable to the Glazers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Manchester United board members Avi Glazer, left, and Joel Glazer at Old Trafford during the 2015-16 season. Photograph: Jon Super/AP\n\n\nThe United executive vice-chairman, Ed Woodward, said: “As we near the end of the season, I am delighted we have picked up two trophies [the Community Shield and the League Cup] and look forward to competing for a third in the Europa League final, the only trophy we have never won.\n“We are forecasting better full year financial performance than expected and as such have raised our revenue and profit guidance. We look forward to a strong finish to 2016-17 on and off the pitch.”\nJosé Mourinho is giving his players days off on an “à la carte” basis as he looks to keep the squad fresh for the Europa League final in Stockholm. United travel to Southampton for Wednesday’s penultimate Premier League game with Paul Pogba to miss the game because of his father’s funeral. Mourinho also has four long-term absentees owing to injury: Marcos Rojo, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Ashley Young and Luke Shaw. Timothy Fosu-Mensah is battling to be fit for the final following a dislocated shoulder.\nRegarding resting players before the final, which if won also awards Champions League qualification, Mourinho said: “It’s all so difficult. I am giving one-day holiday, à la carte, if you understand what I mean. Monday Daley Blind, one day off, Monday Henrikh Mkhitaryan one day off. Ander Herrera one day off. But the guys who played 90 minutes [in Sunday’s 2-1 loss at Tottenham Hotspur] I cannot give one day off if I want them to play against Southampton.\n“It is à la carte and trying to have the people the best they can be. So this is a period in one week when I have to give one day off and now I give a day off to Antonio Valencia. It has to be. And against Crystal Palace [the final game] two or three more and against Southampton two or three more and that’s to try to arrive in the final in the best possible conditions.”\nPogba may return for the visit of Palace on Sunday, though the decision is being left to the midfielder. Mourinho said: “I don’t think Paul has the conditions to play. We have left him completely free to be back when he thinks he’s ready.”\nMourinho had previously confirmed that Sergio Romero will retain his regular Europa League starting berth against Ajax. The Argentinian will also play in one of the final two league outings.\n\n\n\n\nAjax return to the Cruyff ideals as Peter Bosz leads new generation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Now we need everybody,” Mourinho said. “Fosu-Mensah is the only one who has a little chance to be ready for the final and even this kid is trying everything to be fit because the others are impossible. What I want from the last two league games from the players is a good attitude, a positive approach and team spirit. An understanding that some guys have to sacrifice themselves for the good of others.\n“A final is a final and we have to go to the final with everything like Ajax does because they have finished the season and they do not have any more football to play until the final.”\nMourinho was impressed with Anthony Martial in the defeat at Spurs. “Yes, he was good. He was OK against Arsenal – against Celta he didn’t play because the options were different but he’s fine, he’s fine and he’s one of the guys for who it’s very important to play 90 minutes,” said the manager. “Chris Smalling, Phil Jones, Juan Mata, it’s very important for them to play 90 minutes.”\n"

It’s the same old journey, just even more tedious, long-winded and painful than usual. But we’ll get there in the end.\n\n\n\n\nManchester City set to pay world record £34.9m for goalkeeper Ederson\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe list of players Manchester United fancy continues to grow and grow. Internazionale winger Ivan Perišić is the latest diacritic-heavy name on the list. United have been given a price of £36m for the Croatian international, a fee they consider a bit steep despite his ability to go outside a man. So imagine how Chelsea feel: they’ve been quoted £48m for some reason. \nUnited are also after Paris St-Germain midfielder Blaise Matuidi. They have been for some time, but the 30-year-old has refused to sign a new contract with the French giants, and José Mourinho’s eyes are suddenly on stalks. \nIt hasn’t really worked out for Claude Puel at Southampton. Just a top-10 finish and the club’s first League Cup final for 38 years. He’s waiting to be bundled out of the door in disgrace, and has set up a contingency plan with St Etienne just in case he’s read the runes correctly. \nManchester City are close to stealing off with another of Monaco’s young stars. Having already signed Bernardo Silva, they’re now in for left-back Benjamin Mendy. Across the road, Mourinho, having also expressed an interest, fumes impotently. \nAll change at Woking. \nAtlético Madrid are stepping up their interest in FA Cup final goalscoring hero Diego Costa. You can still be a goalscoring hero on the losing side, right? It’s all about taking part. \nHere’s another rumour we’ve heard before, but it’s a quiet day, so. West Ham United are ready to place a £20m order for Manchester City striker Kelechi Iheanacho. The Hammers also want Sunderland keeper Jordan Pickford, and are preparing a £25m cash-plus-player package to fend off Everton. The identity of the player they’re planning to offload to Wearside is as yet unknown. Former Newcastle favourite and boyhood Toon fan Andy Carroll? Please let it be former Newcastle favourite and boyhood Toon fan Andy Carroll. \nBirmingham City wheeler-dealer Harry Redknapp is very interested in Aberdeen winger Jonny Hayes, who came as close as anyone this season to undoing the Celtic Invincibles at Hampden on Saturday.\nAnd the toilet on the bus to Exeter St Davids is out of order, apologies for any inconvenience but that’s the way it is.\n"

        "text": "\nJosé Mourinho’s dark mood was not transformed entirely – Paul Scholes and the so-called “kings of rock and roll” got it in the neck after the game – but the same could not be said of Manchester United’s second-half display at Everton. Clinical, classy and confident; Mourinho’s men welcomed in the new year in a manner that seemed beyond them during their festive slump.\nSuperb finishes from Anthony Martial and Jesse Lingard brought United a first win in five matches and a return to second place in the Premier League. A 12-point gap remains between themselves and Manchester City but, after a slow-burning start and despite missing several key performers, they imposed their quality and superiority over Sam Allardyce’s ambitionless team. It needs to be a benchmark for the remainder of the campaign or those kings of rock and roll – presumably the “Class of 92” – will be playing the record that so irks the United manager.\n\n\n\n\nEverton 0-2 Manchester United: Premier League – as it happened\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“From the first minute to the 70th we were improving, improving, improving,” said Mourinho. “We controlled the ball, we crossed a lot, the goals were phenomenal, Juan Mata’s shot hit the post and there was an amazing save by the kid [Everton’s Jordan Pickford]. We found a way to play without Romelu [Lukaku] and Zlatan [Ibrahimovic] and we played really well.”\nThe first half lived down to expectations, reflecting the dour recent form that both teams brought into a contest played on a wet and windy Merseyside evening, but United gradually took command with Paul Pogba to the fore. Mourinho’s new captain almost fashioned a breakthrough when he broke into the Everton area but his low cross eluded several team-mates who were waiting to convert. The midfielder also tested Pickford with a 30-yard drive that the Everton goalkeeper tipped round his post while Martial forced a fine low save from the £30m summer signing.\nAllardyce once again deployed his team purely to contain. The end result was a second consecutive defeat and a second home game in succession without an Everton shot on target. Goodison’s patience is wearing thin and Allardyce’s attempts to sign Cenk Tosun from Besiktas have stalled with the Turkish club now demanding more than the £25m agreed in principle last week.\n“I presume we will know in the next 24 hours if we are successful or not,” said the Everton manager of the Tosun deal. “We need a bigger goalscoring threat than we have at the moment. Our attacking powers are limited. I knew that before I arrived and that’s why I’ve worked so hard on keeping clean sheets. That’s our main objective, to make sure we pick up more results by not conceding goals and hoping we can score one to win a game. Our ratio of chances created is very limited.”\nMercifully from a United perspective there was improvement after the interval as they built momentum and forced the home side ever deeper. Better movement and distribution was key to their strong start to the second half and Mata twice went close to opening the scoring from distance. The Spain international’s first attempt from 25 yards was pushed over by Pickford. His second, a left-footed drive after cutting inside, flew beyond the goalkeeper but struck a post.\nEverton’s reprieve did not last long. The breakthrough had developed an air of inevitability, such was United’s dominance, and was executed with a touch of excellence. At the end of a sweeping counterattack Pogba picked out Martial in more space than he should have been allowed just outside the Everton penalty area. Central, and 20 yards out, the striker took aim for the top-left corner of Pickford’s goal and found his spot perfectly. Martial’s seventh goal of an inconsistent campaign was a fine way to end a barren run.\n\n\n\n\nJosé Mourinho turns on Paul Scholes after Paul Pogba shines at Everton\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAllardyce responded to falling behind by introducing Aaron Lennon and James McCarthy for Yannick Bolasie and Rooney respectively, the latter switch attracting audible derision from the Gwladys Street end. United responded by remaining on the front foot and Pogba twice almost doubled their lead, forcing another good stop from Pickford at close range and just failing to connect cleanly with Martial’s inviting cross moments later. Pogba was a persistent threat roaming in from the left and teed up Lingard for a low shot that Everton’s keeper, yet again, foiled.\nIn fairness to the Everton manager his double substitution sparked a much-needed reaction from the hosts. Oumar Niasse headed wide when Mason Holgate’s cross found the striker unmarked in front of goal and Everton belatedly exerted pressure on the United defence, but the game was put out of their reach by another supreme finish. Pogba, inevitably, was involved, playing Lingard into space on the left before wheeling away in celebration as the winger cut across a weak challenge by Michael Keane and curled an unstoppable finish into the top corner.\n“Boys jump or they don’t jump,” said Mourinho when asked of Lingard’s increasing influence. “It is one thing to be a talent and another to be a very good player. Some players are not capable of that jump, they go from great potential to normal player, but I think Jesse is making that jump.”\n"

Roberto Martínez, who bought Lukaku from Chelsea for £30m in 2014 when Everton manager, recently claimed the Merseyside club would hope to treble the fee and although United are unlikely to pay that much, the Merseyside club will hold out for more than £60m for the player.\nIf United, currently sixth in the Premier League table, do not qualify for the Champions League this may put Chelsea in pole position, with Antonio Conte also intent on bringing the Belgian back to his former club.\nLukaku is represented by Mino Raiola, who is also the agent of Paul Pogba and Henrikh Mkhitaryan, two players that joined United last summer along with Zlatan Ibrahimovic.\nThe Belgian is the Premier League’s top scorer, his 24 goal-total three better than Tottenham Hotspur’s Harry Kane. Mourinho wants a proven finisher and centre-forward who can be a focal point for the attack in the same style as Ibrahimovic or Didier Drogba and Diego Costa, the latter two No9s being used in this way when the Portuguese managed Chelsea.\nDuring his second spell at Stamford Bridge, Mourinho allowed Lukaku to go on loan to West Bromwich Albion and Everton before sanctioning his sale to the Goodison Park club in July 2014. But the 54-year-old is now convinced of Lukaku’s quality and was intent on signing him even before Ibrahimovic’s serious knee injury that may have ended the 35-year-old’s career at Old Trafford.\nIbrahimovic’s surgeon believes the Swede is capable of playing for years to come. “I can tell you he’s in superb shape in all things,” Freddie Fu Ho-keung told the South China Morning Post. “Healthy morphology, the quality of the bone and muscle, everything is as good as you can possibly see.\n“He’s one of the top athletes I’ve ever touched, he is in superb shape. He can still play for many years, he’s so healthy, so strong.”\n"

        "text": "\nAntoine Griezmann has struck fear into the hearts of idle rumourmongers everywhere by hinting that he might stay at Atlético Madrid after all, because he wants to “win trophies with this team”. Encouragingly, the news hasn’t held anyone back, with news of his imminent departure, as part of what the Times’ big headline describes as “United’s £200m spree”, on most of Friday’s back pages.\nIt turns out the details of the “£200m spree” in Friday’s paper are very much identical to the details of United’s less fully-costed spree that have been all over the same newspapers for months now. The Star features Griezmann prominently in its list of the players United have identified to correct “a lack of swagger and stardust” in their current side and insist his £86m buyout clause “will not stop United from writing a cheque”. \n\n\n\n\nFootball transfer rumours: Manchester United chasing Bayern Munich duo?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso on their shoping list: Real Madrid’s Raphaël Varane, Monaco’s Tiemoué Bakayoko, Chelsea’s Willian, Romelu Lukaku of Everton, Eric Dier of Tottenham and Burnley’s Michael Keane. The Independent agrees, saying a move to sign Griezmann is “well under way”, with United honchos “confident” of success and “determined to avoid a long public saga”. Given that this one has already been going for at least eight months, they’ve already made a right hash of that. The BBC says that “United are likely to limit their summer spending to three or four key signings”, so just a third of an entirely new team, while the Times says “up to four” new arrivals – signed at a cost of some £200m – will include “a defender, a central midfielder, a forward and possibly a No9”.\nMilan aren’t hanging around: having already convinced Álvaro Morata to agree a £7.5m-a-year (after tax) contract, leaving the Rossoneri to simply rummage around the back of the sofa in search of £35m or so they need in order to convince Real Madrid to play ball, they are now working on target No2. And that target is a certain Marko Arnautovic, who both Milan and Paris Saint-Germain consider worth the £15m Stoke are asking and believe – to use the Sun’s phrase – he is “a special talent capable of changing games with his off-the-cuff skills”. Mark Hughes has meanwhile taken a fancy to the £3.5m Nancy centre-back Modou Diagne, who “would relish the chance to move to the Premier League”, according to the aforementioned tabloid.\nWayne Rooney has decided to swap Britain for Beijing – or somewhere else in China that doesn’t alliterate quite so nicely – with the Mirror announcing that the deal could be done in a matter of days; the transfer window is due to open on 19 June. “Rooney’s advisers expect to negotiate a £600,000-a-week deal for him,” it announces. That’s six hundred thousand pounds a week. The Mail knows of “at least two £50m offers” for the pug-faced poacher, though it thinks that works out at a relatively meagre £480,000 a week. Or he can join Everton on a little under a third of that, a possibility that “could persuade him to stay” in this green and pleasant land. Diego Costa’s £60m move to the same country could be scuppered by a new 100% tax on enormous international transfer fees being imposed by the Chinese FA, which would turn it into a £120m move that represents particularly poor value for money, even for China’s soccer spendthrifts.\nAlexis Sánchez is mulling over yet another contract offer, with Arsenal’s latest proposition being that they pay him only £270,000 a week. “However,” the Mail notes, and happily for the charming Chilean, “the offer is loaded with incentives.” Alternatively he could just go to Bayern Munich, Juventus or Paris St-Germain.\n\n\n\n\nWilfried Zaha signs new five-year contract with Crystal Palace\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWest Bromwich, Leicester and Everton are all interested in Troy Deeney, or at least they will be until they hear that Watford want £35m for him. The Mail has uncovered an escape clause in the striker’s contract that allows him to leave if the Hornets can bank a clean £25m as a result, but given the amount of money they will have to pass on to his former club, Walsall, any offer will need to comfortably exceed that amount if his departure is to be green-lit.\nWatch out Glasgow! News is a-breakin’ that Rangers want to sign the midfielder Carlos Peña, who is known in his native Mexico as “Gullit” – after examining several photographs the Mill can only assume this is because Mexicans have forgotten what Ruud Gullit looked like – and has something of a reputation for his hard-partying ways. “They tell so many lies about me,” Peña says of the media. “I have just started to ignore all the things coming out. It’s gossip. They say I’m a drunk and chase women. I don’t care. It doesn’t hurt me because I know they are lies.” The media is full of gossip, you say? Never!\n"

        "text": "\nAs Manchester United’s players celebrated with the Europa League trophy, José Mourinho brandished a red flag. He walked in front of his squad and tried to plant it into the pitch. The pole, though, was too flimsy and bent, leaving Mourinho to prop the flag awkwardly against a hoarding reading “Stockholm Final 2017”. As a metaphor for his first season at United it could hardy have been bettered: grand gestures thwarted but the job eventually, just about, done.\nIt was a night replete with symbolism. Deep into injury-time at the Friends Arena on Wednesday night, the Ajax winger Amin Younes picked up the ball on the left. He glanced up and had just made as though to jink inside when he was clattered by the horizontal form of Wayne Rooney making an effective if clunking challenge that put the ball out for a throw-in. That it could be his last ever touch in a United shirt felt hugely appropriate; he has throughout most of his career had a pleasing commitment to the necessary but unglamorous work.\n\n\n\n\nManchester United’s Paul Pogba sets up Europa League final win over Ajax\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut it also said something about Mourinho’s United and how they overwhelmed Ajax in a generally underwhelming final. This is the most expensive football squad ever assembled, and yet it ended with Marouane Fellaini playing as a lone striker.\nWhether that matters or not depends on perspective. In the immediate context, it probably doesn’t. Mourinho’s celebrations, kissing the trophy before it was presented to Rooney and then pretending to run off with it as the players celebrated in front of the United fans, suggested just how much this meant to him, just how essential victory and qualifying for next season’s Champions League is to United’s rebuilding work. Winning was the critical thing; the how can come later.\nIt’s not, though, as simple as that. Mourinho is not a manager who occasionally adopts a policy of pragmatism to achieve a specific goal, before switching to something more expansive. Rather, he revels in discarding aesthetic expectations, in scorning “the poets” whose idealistic abstractions “win every match”. This season Mourinho attacked the “Einsteins” who were opposed to him; railing against the arts and the sciences, he truly is a man under siege. Wednesday’s win, Mourinho said, was “a victory of the pragmatism, a victory of the humble people, a victory of the people who respect the opponents, a victory of the people who try to stop the opponents and exploit their weaknesses”.\n\n\n \n\n\nPlay Video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n0:32\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Paul Pogba dedicates Europa League win to Manchester attack victims – video\n\n\nIn that sense, this was a Mourinho masterclass. Ajax have thrilled this season with their high pressing and the fluency of their play, but United thwarted that. As their coach, Peter Bosz, said: “I didn’t see that Ajax here.” Mourinho has, with some fury, dismissed the veracity of certain claims in Diego Torres’s biography of him, but the seven-point plan laid out for winning big games held true here. United minimised their risk, let Ajax have the ball and seized on their mistakes. “High pressing was difficult because Manchester United only played long balls, didn’t take any risks and played only on second balls,” Bosz said. “I think it was a boring game.”\nPerhaps for neutrals it was but that will not bother Mourinho. “There are lots of poets in football,” he said, “but poets don’t win titles.” Avoiding risk was one part of the strategy; the other was to cut off the supply to Kasper Dolberg.\n\n\n\n\nLack of a Plan B for Ajax costs them dear when chasing Europa League final | Michael Cox\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Ajax wingers Younes and Bertrand Traoré had respectively completed the most and the 10th most dribbles in the Europa League this season. They managed seven each on Wednesday, but the end product was a solitary key pass apiece. They got the ball, they ran with the ball and they found themselves without an option. So isolated was Dolberg that the first time he touched the ball was to kick off after Paul Pogba had given United an 18th-minute lead.\nThe question is whether in the longer term that is enough. The suggestion that there is something hubristic about looking to impose your style on opponents rather than stopping them from playing was characteristic Mourinho propaganda. He understands that the anti-establishment, underdog shtick he employed so successfully at Porto, Chelsea and Internazionale won’t really work at United, just as it quickly palled at Real Madrid once the urgent goal of toppling Pep Guardiola had been achieved. You can’t be one of the two richest clubs in the world, with a noodle deal in every territory, and pretend your reactive football is a necessary gambit in the face of an overwhelming inferiority of resources.\nSimilarly, United will accept the “humble” approach for as long as it seems necessary. The four seasons since Sir Alex Ferguson’s retirement have been turbulent. If this is what it takes to get the club back on track, so be it. But if this is, as seems likely, another summer of significant expenditure, directors and fans will soon start to expect at least a little poetry to enter Mourinho’s soul and United’s play.\n"

And having become only the second English club to complete a clean sweep of the major European prizes, they’ll make like the first, Chelsea, and embark on a serious summer spending spree. Admittedly they’d have done this whatever the result last night, but after doing a comprehensive number on Ajax, they’ve earned the right to spoil themselves a little, huh.\nThe president of Atlético Madrid has gone on the radio to insist that Antoine Griezmann hasn’t asked for a move, and in any case nobody in their right mind would stump up the striker’s £85m release clause. United chief executive Ed Woodward stifles a yawn, licks the side of his thumb, and begins the big count. One, two, three...\n\n\n\n\nJermain Defoe set for return to Bournemouth on £20m three-year deal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnited are also very interested in £50m Ross Barkley, having enjoyed good experiences of nicking off with Everton’s best young talent in the past. They’d also like Renato Sanches and Douglas Costa from Bayern Munich, though Juventus fancy that double swoop too, while Tottenham Hotspur will rival them for Costa. And they’ll also tighten up that stingy defence even further, with bids for Burnley’s Michael Keane and Benfica’s Victor Lindelof.\nBut it’s not all good news for the new Europa League champions, because Barcelona are after last night’s man of the match Ander Herrera. Hey, swings and roundabouts.\nCeltic, one cup-final victory away from an unbeaten domestic season which would knock the Preston and Arsenal invincibles into a cocked hat, fancy snaffling some more young Premier League talent on loan, having done pretty darn well with Manchester City’s Patrick Roberts this season. Brendan Rodgers has a good idea what 20-year-old Liverpool winger Harry Wilson is about, so he’ll do.\nBack in 2014, Derek McInnes led Aberdeen to their first trophy in 18 years, the Scottish League Cup. If he manages to ruin Celtic’s entire season at Hampden on Saturday, he’ll have won their first Scottish Cup for 27 years. Whatever happens in the big game, he deserves reward and recognition. All he’s getting, however, is a job offer from Sunderland. It’s not much to show for a life’s work, is it.\nNewcastle United are in for Sporting Lisbon midfielder William Carvalho, a former hot new thing whose star has slightly faded of late, and 18-year-old Caen winger Yann Karamoh, whose star is very much rising. Ah Newcastle ... a beautiful star ... the Rumour Mill misses the old Broon-sponsored kit, Ossie Ardiles, the irregular stripes, all that. Wonga and Fun88 just don’t cut it.\nWest Bromwich Albion are also interested in Carvalho, plus Manchester City striker Kelechi Iheanacho. These attempts by Tony Pulis to take things up a notch and recreate some 1978-style sass-ball may be scuppered by either Everton, Southampton, West Ham or Borussia Dortmund, all of whom fancy the City substitute striker themselves.\nJust in case that one falls through, West Ham have lined up Juventus striker Mario Mandzukic, though Besiktas are doing their best to jigger that deal too. It’s going to be a long summer for the Hammers. It’s going to be a long summer for us all. The transfer window isn’t even open yet. Good grief.\n"

Security teams from Liverpool and United have been working with their Russian counterparts in an attempt to avoid problems for the estimated 2,000 away fans expected in Moscow.\nHowever, the head of the Russian Football Union’s security committee, Vladimir Markin, has warned there will be severe penalties for anyone found guilty of hooliganism.\n\n\n\n\nSadio Mané returns in Moscow but Klopp puts Liverpool balance before art\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarkin told the Tass state news agency: “I don’t want to scare anyone but I warn those who plan to come here not to support their side and see the country but to commit hooliganism: the law is the same for all, not just for Russians.

Last month Amazon outbid Sky, paying a reported £10m a year, for the UK rights to the ATP tennis tour, its first major live sport acquisition outside the US. Woodward noted Amazon now streams an NFL game on Thursdays and that Major League Soccer has a deal with Facebook to show 22 games a season and he told investors Facebook and Amazon had been interested in bidding for the IPL cricket rights.\nAsked if he expects the tech giants to bid in the next round of Premier League rights sales, which is expected to open before the end of this year, Woodward said: “Absolutely, I think they will enter the mix; anecdotally, there was incredibly strong interest in the last cycle. We are hearing that around the Premier League table and we are also hearing that from a European perspective in terms of interest in the Champions League and Europa rights. I do think we are going to see an increasing engagement from these and we would welcome the interest.”\nWoodward announced another year of record income made by United in the last financial year. The 2016-17 accounts for Manchester United plc, which is registered in the Cayman Islands tax haven and floated on the NYSE, showed total income of £581m. That was a £66m increase on 2015-16, even though United did not compete in the Champions League last season, having failed to qualify under Louis van Gaal.\nUnited’s earning power from its global popularity, broadcasting, sponsorships and 76,000 capacity stadium far exceeds that of any other Premier League club; their income of £515m in 2015-16 was £123m more than that of the next highest-earning club, the Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City. United’s pre-tax profit last year was £57m, while the cost of financing their debts was £25m. The club’s borrowings, still dating from the debt-loading takeover by the US‑based Glazer family 12 years ago, remain £498m.\nFacebook did not comment on whether it will bid for Premier League rights but confirmed it does plan generally to secure live sport on video and their platform Facebook Watch.

        "text": "\nIn the aftermath of Celta Vigo’s cancelled match with Real Madrid in February, when a storm ripped through the roof at their Balaídos stadium and accusations flew, their coach, Eduardo Berizzo, protested: “I still can’t make it rain.” No, some supporters suggested, but there is plenty you can do.\nThe team that beat Barcelona three years in a row, putting four past them the last two times they visited Vigo, had after all just deservedly knocked Madrid out of the Copa del Rey to reach the semi‑finals. Now they have reached a Europa League semi-final against Manchester United.\n\n\n\n\nCristiano Ronaldo continues to make fools of those trying to write him off | Jacob Steinberg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“To do anything, you have to imagine it first,” Berizzo insists and he says his players have convinced him that Celta can “do something important” – but few imagined this. Although they were defeated in the cup by Alavés, denied the chance to face Barcelona in the final just as happened last year when they had defeated Atlético Madrid but fell to Sevilla, this is some achievement.\nIn June 2009, a late goal from a 21-year-old substitute rescued Celta from relegation to Spain’s regionalised third tier; on Thursday they host United. Iago Aspas, formerly of Liverpool, has been there before, but his team have not.\nCelta have never won anything, although they have been beaten in three finals, and they certainly have never been in a European semi-final. Last week, they got there before anyone else, their meeting with Genk the only quarter-final that did not go to extra time. There were still six potential opponents as they started heading out of the stadium. “Whoever we face, we’ll go for them,” the centre-back Andreu Fontàs said.\nIt is very much their way. In the autumn of 2014, Celta beat Barcelona 1-0 at the Camp Nou, riding their luck a little, but the following year they hammered them 4-1 at Balaídos, and the year after defeated them 4-3. All over the pitch they suffocated Luis Enrique’s team, going for the throat. “When Barcelona don’t have the ball, they’re not Barcelona and every robbery was an automatic attack,” Berizzo said.\n\n\n\n\n \n\nI want the ball the maximum amount of time possible and when I don’t have it I want it back. Then I want dynamism, spark\n\nEduardo Berizzo\n\n\n\nThat line broadly sums up Celta’s style even if, as the season has gone on, it has been adapted, the coach talking about playing with “intelligence” and a touch of pragmatism sneaking in. When it comes to excitement, few teams in Spain have been better to watch and the idea has not changed significantly, even as they have lost key players: Michael Krohn-Dehli went to Sevilla, Augusto Fernández to Atlético and Nolito to Manchester City, while Fabián Orellana left in the winter in controversial circumstances, accused of disloyalty by his manager.\n“I like us to control games, to be protagonists; I don’t like us to be dominated,” Berizzo says. Berizzo is a former Celta defender who played in a Copa del Rey final and describes his connection to the club as intense, his experience full of “extreme moments”: they reached a cup final and the Champions League, suffered relegation and got promoted again. He has been influenced by Marcelo Bielsa, having played under the Argentinian coach at Newell’s and then joined him on the coaching staff with Chile. “A great apprenticeship,” he calls it.\n“I want the ball the maximum amount of time possible and when I don’t have it I want it back,” Berizzo says. “Then I want dynamism, mobility, spark, and I want us to use it well. I want us to be a team whose movements make it hard for the opposition to read us.”\nTechnically accomplished, Celta press high with intensity, running opponents down and then running at them. At the heart of it is Aspas – hyperactive, creative and decisive, scorer of 22 goals in 39 club games and called up to the Spain side, a goalscorer at Wembley in November. “He has found his place in the world,” Berizzo says.\n\n\n\n\nChampions League and Europa League: previews for the four semi-finals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheirs is a style that can at times leave them exposed and one that the coach admits makes huge physical demands on the players. Celta have played more games than anyone in Spain, too, forcing them to manage their minutes carefully and leave the league to one side. Every player in the squad has missed at least six league games, including the goalkeeper Sergio, and domestic football has been virtually ignored lately. Natural starters have not even been travelling, which helps to explain a run of five defeats in the last six and just three wins (and seven defeats) in 12.\nEurope has occupied them instead. Three rounds in a row, they had to go away in the second leg, at Shakhtar Donetsk, FC Krasnodar and Genk, and each time they made it through.\nIt has not been easy and it is about to get far harder. Now comes a fourth second-leg trip: to Old Trafford. They have fallen at the last before but they have overcome greater obstacles than this, too. Five years ago they were in the Spanish second division; now they are in a European semi-final.\n“There have been hard times, but now we’re extremely proud,” said Hugo Mallo, the club captain and a former youth-teamer born across the Ria de Vigo in Marín. Fontàs said: “We’ve made history. Now we have to keep dreaming.”\n"

It is believed to have been repeated during Sunday’s 4-0 win against Everton at the same venue when Lukaku, who joined United from the Merseyside club for a fee of £75m rising to £90m with add-ons in July, scored one goal and assisted another.\n\n\n\n\nAttention (some) Manchester United fans: all racial stereotyping is racist | Marina Hyde\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKick It Out have written directly to United asking them to act and in a statement published by The Times a spokesperson for the organisation is quoted as saying: “Kick It Out is aware of the footage of the alleged racist chanting by supporters of Manchester United that emerged on Wednesday evening [13 September]. The lyrics used in the chant are offensive and discriminatory. Racist stereotypes are never acceptable in football or wider society, irrespective of showing support for a player.\n“We have contacted Manchester United and will be working closely with them and the FA to ensure that the issue is addressed swiftly.

        "text": "\nManchester United conceded a late Gylfi Sigurdsson strike as José Mourinho’s side dropped two points in the race for a top-four finish after Wayne Rooney had given them the lead with a questionable penalty.\nRooney needlessly barged Jordan Ayew for the 79th-minute free-kick that Sigurdsson curled into the top right-hand corner. It left David de Gea stationary, the goalkeeper perhaps confused by Ander Herrera, who ran back from the wall on to the line and then out again. To add to a difficult day for United, Luke Shaw and Eric Bailly went off to join a lengthy injury list.\nMarcus Rashford may also be the subject of much discussion after his fall for Rooney’s 45th-minute spot-kick came when he looked for contact with the Swansea City goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski.\n\n\n\n\nSwansea’s Paul Clement accuses Marcus Rashford of winning penalty by deceit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManchester City later drew at Middlesbrough, doubling the frustration for Mourinho as United stay in fifth place and a point behind on 65 points, with Liverpool level with Pep Guardiola’s side. Arsenal remain five points behind United after Sunday’s 2-0 defeat by Tottenham Hotspur, though they have a game in hand. It means that despite a 25th unbeaten Premier League match in a row for Mourinho’s side – a club record – achieving a Champions League berth via a top-four finish is out of their hands and their best hope to qualify may lie with the Europa League.\nThe United manager said: “We lost players and we lost points, so yes today was bad. You cannot isolate the performance out of the context. This is the ninth match of April – it is not human. We have a squad of 22 that is reduced to 13 or 14 players. The players are very tired.”\nUnited’s success in the EFL Cup by beating Southampton 3-2 in the final and progress in the Europa League – they play at Celta Vigo in the semi-final first leg on Thursday – means the side will play a minimum of 63 matches this season and Mourinho again criticised the fixture scheduling. “It’s a consequence of our success but also of something that you cannot be punished for,” he said.\n“Because we play the League Cup final, and then you have to play the [rearranged] game midweek. Why you don’t stop the [Premier League] competition when you play the final? Imagine if we go to the FA Cup semi-finals we will be playing Tottenham last weekend, that Burnley game then would also to be played later. When? When? When will we be playing that game? After the FA Cup final? In June? In next pre-season?”\n\n\n \n\n\nPlay Video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1:58\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  ‘High levels of fatigue’: José Mourinho on Manchester United’s draw with Swansea – video\n\n\nMourinho said if they reached the Europa League final he might field a shadow side against Crystal Palace on the final weekend of the season if the match is meaningless.\n“It was a blessing that we didn’t play the FA Cup semi-final but we go to the same problem, you are punished for doing well and if we beat Celta, we have the final on the Wednesday and we play against Crystal Palace on the Sunday,” he said. “We play Southampton two days before. So again maybe this result is also a blessing because maybe I can bring Nicky Butt [the academy director] and his team to play against Crystal Palace and hopefully Crystal Palace doesn’t need a game to stay in the division because it would be very bad if they needed the points for us to play with the under-23s.”\nIf Rooney’s 252nd goal for the club cheered Mourinho what happened before and after would not have done. Shaw was forced off after eight minutes and Bailly just before the hour, each with leg injuries. As the latter became the fourth frontline central defender to be unavailable, Matteo Darmian, a full-back, had to come on and fill in.\nShaw was one of four changes made by Mourinho, who also brought in Rooney, Jesse Lingard and Ashley Young. Antonio Valencia, Darmian and Henrikh Mkhitaryan made way, with Marouane Fellaini suspended.\nPaul Clement’s side, who showed one change with Ki Sung-yeung coming in for Leroy Fer, went close to an early goal. Ayew slipped into a gap left by Bailly but his shot was blocked by the French defender, whose attempted clearance ricocheted off Sigurdsson and the ball rolled to safety.\nUnited’s dubious penalty was awarded when Rashford went down going past Fabianski, who kept his hands close to his body. After a noticeable pause the referee Neil Swarbrick pointed to the spot, a decision from the referee that left Fabianski and the rest of his team-mates “furious”, Clement said. Mourinho, on his way to the changing room, watched his side take the lead from the tunnel.\nSigurdsson’s equaliser was merited and Swansea deserve much credit for the way they fought back. The point could be invaluable in their fight against relegation. They remain third bottom, two points behind 17th-placed Hull City.\nMourinho will have Paul Pogba and Fellaini back for the Vigo trip plus a fully fit Juan Mata, who was an unused substitute against Swansea. But he has to think about who will play at centre-back and who can be potential substitutes for the position should he suffer further ill fortune in north-west Spain. He said Phil Jones and Chris Smalling were likely to remain unavailable despite his repeated public entreaties to hurry them back from leg injuries.\n"

        "text": "\nJosé Mourinho feels Manchester United will be back in their “natural habitat” when they return to Champions League combat for the first time in 644 days against Basel at Old Trafford on Tuesday night.\n“To be in the Champions League is just to go back to the natural habitat, season after season, for Manchester United,” the manager said. “I look forward to tomorrow and hope Old Trafford feels it in the same way we feel it. Our motivation’s high. We’ll try to qualify and enjoy that special knockout phase with the best teams in Europe.”\nAlthough last season was only the second campaign in 22 years in which United had been absent from the competition, Mourinho was not about to dismiss the Europa League, which his team won. “I enjoyed it,” he said.\n\n\n\n\nJosé Mourinho blames Marouane Fellaini’s absence for slip-up at Stoke\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“In the Champions League there are four or five teams with an incredible level of quality, of experience, of know-how and that’s what makes the difference. But there are many other teams in the Champions League with very similar qualities to teams in the Europa League.”\nAccordingly Basel promise to represent a fairly gentle reintroduction to United’s favourite competition. Raphael Wicky was routinely described as “combative” during his days as a defensive midfielder for, among others, Hamburg but the 40-year-old’s new side are not yet cast in anything like a similarly formidable image.\nIndeed Wicky has endured a somewhat tough induction after years of working his way through the youth ranks at Basel resulted in his promotion from coaching the under-21s to managing the seniors this summer.\nAlthough the Swiss champions stand a respectable third in a Super League led by Zurich, they are 10 points worse off than this time last year and lost 2-1 at home against Lausanne last Saturday.\nBasel, close to the French and German borders and bisected by the Rhine, is better known for its museum-studded medieval centre complete with a handsome red standstone town hall and Gothic cathedral than the local football club. Yet even in the relatively genteel context of St Jakob-Park, there seems a sense of pressure building.\nRicky van Wolfswinkel hopes to ease it. He may have been branded a Premier League flop during an underwhelming stint with Norwich City but, on the European mainland, it is a very different story for a striker averaging more than a goal a game.\nWith Phil Jones and Eric Bailly suspended, their replacements, Chris Smalling and Victor Lindelof, will need to beware of Van Wolfswinkel. “I don’t think Bailly and Jones are better than them,” said Mourinho, whose side dropped their first Premier League points during the 2-2 draw at Stoke City on Saturday. “Even if Jones and Bailly weren’t suspended, probably I would still play Lindelof and Smalling. For me they’re the same level.”\nNonetheless it appears an important night for Lindelof as the Sweden defender, signed from Benfica for £31m, starts his first game at Old Trafford. “I think it is easier for him to play Champions League,” Mourinho said. “It’s more comparable to the Portuguese style. He needs a little time to adapt to the Premier League but I’m more than confident about him. He’s a very good player with a very good potential. There are reasons for the other boys, Eric and Jones, to be worried because Victor’s a very good player.”\nHe had similarly warm words for Marouane Fellaini who appears to be overcoming a calf problem. “He’s a very important player for me – much more important than what you can imagine,” Mourinho said. “I feel weaker without Fellaini in my squad.”\nManchester United (possible 4-3-3) De Gea; Valencia, Smalling, Lindelof, Blind; Fellaini, Matic, Pogba; Mata, Lukaku, Rashford.\nBasel (possible; 4-2-3-1): Vaclik; Lang, Suchy, Akanji, Riveros; Xhaka, Serey Die; Steffen, Zuffi, Bua; Wolfswinkel.\nReferee Ruddy Buquet (Fr)\n"

        "text": "\nIt was a victory that came at a cost for Manchester United bearing in mind the implications for Paul Pogba and the sight of the club’s most expensive player prematurely making his way along the touchline with the look of someone who knew it might be the last time the crowd see him for a while. Pogba had lasted only 19 minutes and maybe this is now the time for Marouane Fellaini to show why José Mourinho, like Louis van Gaal and David Moyes previously, has kept faith in him during intermittent periods when the crowd at Old Trafford have not been so sure.\n\n\n\n\nManchester United 3-0 Basel: Champions League – as it happened\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn that front, Fellaini made a promising start, heading in the opening goal a quarter of an hour after replacing his injured colleague and later supplying the cross that led to Marcus Rashford, another one of Mourinho’s substitutes, wrapping up a freewheeling win. In between times, Romelu Lukaku’s headed goal means he has now scored six times in as many appearances for his new club, and the supporters of Everton – the visitors to Old Trafford on Sunday – could probably be forgiven if there is the odd pang of anxiety. Lukaku, in particular, is playing with sky-high confidence and Fellaini seems intent on showing he can be a productive wearer of United’s colours.\nUnited will need that to continue because Pogba’s absence will be a considerable loss. The French midfielder – who left the stadium on crutches – had hamstring problems last season and it was obvious, as soon as he came out of an innocuous challenge with Taulant Xhaka, that he had felt the tell-tale pain at the back of a leg. These injuries are not usually healed inside two to three weeks,and that represents a considerable setback for the Premier League’s early pace-setters given the impressive way he has started his second season at the club.\nFellaini was duly added to a team that also had Victor Lindelöf, the £30.7m recruit from Benfica, making his first appearance since a difficult night in the European Super Cup final against Real Madrid made it apparent to Mourinho that his new signing needed easing in gradually. Chris Smalling was also brought back with another of United’s forgotten men, Ashley Young, wearing the captain’s armband as the right-back in an experimental defence.\n\n\n\n\nCeltic no match for PSG as Neymar and Kylian Mbappé lead 5-0 rout\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYoung has been reduced to a role as an odd-job man for United, filling in for a number of positions, but he rarely lets the team down when he does get the call and it was his cross that led to Fellaini announcing his arrival with a 35th-minute goal. The Belgian was the tallest player in the six-yard area and the goal seemed inevitable as soon as it became apparent the cross was arcing his way.\nUnited probably ought to have been ahead even before Fellaini guided his header past the goalkeeper, Tomas Vaclik, but Henrikh Mkhitaryan headed over after the best move of the opening exchanges and then hit a post with a close-range chance from Lukaku’s cross.\nMkhitaryan had a mixed night because it was his mistake that led to Basel’s only real chance of the night, requiring a brilliant save from David de Gea to deny Mohamed Elyounoussi and leaving Mourinho chuntering at the guilty player from the touchline.\nMourinho later complained that he was not happy with the team’s attitude at 2-0 and Mkhitaryan, almost certainly, was one of the players he was talking about.\n“Everything changed,” Mourinho said. “We stopped playing seriously and stopped making right decisions. We could have put ourselves in trouble. We were playing fantasy football – PlayStation football. I don’t like it, flicks and tricks. We gambled and you have to respect your opponent. I don’t know if goal difference will play a part. We lost position, our shape, we lost balls in easy situations. I didn’t like it, the players relaxed too much.”\nAll the same, it was a relatively stress-free way for United to reintroduce themselves to the Champions League. Basel have won the Swiss championship in each of the past eight season but as sometimes happens when teams visit Old Trafford, they left the impression that they saw it as a sightseeing trip rather than harbouring any real belief they could cause an upset. Éder Balanta, their Colombian centre-half, acquitted himself well and there were some neat touches from Renato Steffen, but there was never any real danger of United being caught once Lukaku had doubled the lead eight minutes into the second half.\n\n\n\n\nPedro sets Chelsea on their way to comfortable win over Qarabag\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, it was a header from the six-yard area and another demonstration, perhaps, that Mourinho’s team are more capable in the air than any set of players who have previously called Old Trafford their home. This time it was Daley Blind supplying the cross and Lukaku emerged from a clutch of players to make the decisive contact.\nAs moderate as Basel were, it still might have been an awkward finale if Elyounoussi’s rising shot had beaten De Gea in the 63rd minute. That, however, was a rare fright and Rashford sealed the win after Fellaini’s cross had gone under Mkhitaryan to reach the substitute 12 yards out.\n"

        "text": "\nEuropean football returns this week, and though the individual highlight may well be the look of distaste on Alexis Sánchez’s face as he comes to terms with Europa League football on Thursday, before that England’s new big five get the chance to establish their credentials in the Champions League.\n\n\n\n\nChampions League squads: Chelsea’s Costa left out but United include Ibrahimovic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo other country has five representatives in the competition, not even Spain or Germany, and it is tempting to wonder whether the Premier League really deserves such prominence when actual results in Europe have been generally disappointing in the last few seasons. Yet Manchester United cannot be faulted for taking the Europa League seriously, something English teams have not always done, and though the rather plodding progress towards success in an unmemorable final seemed the upper limit of José Mourinho’s ambition last season the club have not stood still since.\nA combination of summer strengthening – more than £100m on Romelu Lukaku and Nemanja Matic – and improved performances from last season’s captures Paul Pogba and Henrikh Mkhitaryan have ensured a promising start to the domestic season for United and they now look equipped to compete with the best in Europe.\nThat is not to say Mourinho and his players will be the most successful English side in this Champions League edition, but they probably will not be the first out either. Aside from the uplift in confidence since finishing six points behind Arsenal last season United find themselves in a relatively forgiving group, as do Liverpool.\nManchester City, Chelsea and Tottenham are drawn against more illustrious opponents, with the two London clubs facing the stiffest challenge and Spurs in particular tasked with finishing above the holders in Real Madrid and quarter-finalists last season in Borussia Dortmund. Given what happened last year, and Spurs’ continuing acclimatisation to playing at Wembley, it would not be an enormous surprise to see Mauricio Pochettino’s side stutter again.\nThe time to prove otherwise is on Wednesday, when Spurs begin their Champions League campaign with a “home” tie against Dortmund. Win that and they would have more than the Wembley monkey off their back, it would represent a European statement that could be followed up. Drop points, on the other hand, and a familiar scenario would begin to reassert itself.\nThere is no reason why this talented Tottenham side should not make progress in Europe, except that perhaps more than any other member of the English quintet there appears to be conflict within the club about what the season’s priorities should be.\nAll Premier League clubs in Europe have to make their own compromises on this issue, the top end of the domestic league is far too competitive and unrelenting to allow anyone to take their eye off the ball in order to concentrate on their travels in midweek. Indeed it is permissible to speculate whether even Manchester United would have made such regular visits to Champions League summits had the home front been as difficult to dominate as it is at the moment.\nWith at least five credible title contenders in the Premier League it is a tall order for anyone to succeed at home and abroad – even Pep Guardiola and his well-resourced Manchester City side ended up empty handed last season – and for a club such as Spurs, frustratingly close to a first table-topping finish in over half a century, it is easy to see how Europe can be a distraction. That is not to say Pochettino and his players are dismissive of Champions League commitments, just that they will be naturally wary of putting the cart before the horse.\nIt could be argued that Liverpool, without a title in 27 years, are in a similar position, though the key difference is that European football is something of a passion on Merseyside, and, despite the domestic drought, the club saw Champions League success as recently as 2005. Liverpool are past masters in Europe and it usually shows when Champions League football comes around.\n\n\n\n\nChampions League 2017-18: how will your club do this season?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAny supporter would tell you the priority is the Premier League, and Jürgen Klopp would doubtless agree, but it never feels like that on European nights, especially at Anfield. What Liverpool almost always have going for them in Europe – it might be best to draw a veil over what happened under Brendan Rodgers at Real Madrid three years ago – is desire, belief and a powerful conviction that history can still be made, all of which adds up to a motivation few opponents can match. Klopp is the perfect manager to reinforce the club tradition. Liverpool will always be respected in Europe simply because they respect Europe so much.\nChelsea, as runaway English champions, ought to be able to make an impression in Europe, even if Atlético Madrid will act as an uncomfortable reminder of what has gone wrong since Antonio Conte switched formation to win a title in his first season. The Italian clearly made a mistake in telling Diego Costa his time was up, and since then a few more have followed, most notably in missing transfer targets such as Lukaku, Fernando Llorente and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain.\nThe result, particularly with Eden Hazard out injured, is a squad that looks too thin to battle on two fronts, and like Guardiola, who does not have a thin squad, Conte will have to decide at some point what he feels is his best route to success.\nHad City managed to land Sánchez on the last day of the transfer window they would theoretically have boasted a squad capable of overcoming any challenge, though anyone who has witnessed Guardiola’s side in action knows that it does not always add up to the sum of its parts. Sánchez did not come in any case, and neither did Jonny Evans, and over the course of a season the old failings in defence could prove more significant than the luxury of an extra striker.\nCity will be a force at home and in Europe, though they still look more of a work in progress than genuine candidates to finish on top in either.\n"

You see, they’ve received two offers already and now City have got wind of those they will double-down on their efforts to persuade the Chilean that strolling to the Premier League title from January to May more than makes up for the constant Manchester drizzle.\nErnesto Valverde has the hots for Willian and will instruct the club to bring the Chelsea forward to Barcelona if Liverpool won’t budge on their whopping €200m valuation of Philippe Coutinho. One player who could be on his way out of Camp Nou, though, is Javier Mascherano. “‘I think that my stage here is ending,” he sniffed. “It makes sense that after such a long time there’s not much more I can do in this club.” He fancies bringing his combustible qualities to the superclásico and River Plate is his likely destination and not a return to Anfield. Sorry Liverpool fans. \nTottenham believe an injection of guile is what they need after their season coughed and spluttered to a temporary halt a couple of weeks ago – so look out West Ham because Manuel Lanzini is their No1 target. He’s scored three goals against Spurs since his time in England and that feat has not gone unnoticed by Mauricio Pochettino. \nAnd Real Madrid admin bods are replenishing the toner in their fax machine in preparation for signing a goalkeeper to replace Keylor Navas.

        "text": "\nManchester United conceded for the first time this season and dropped their first points against an impressive Stoke City, who posed major questions throughout a riveting contest. José Mourinho’s side remain league leaders – ahead of Manchester City, who trounced Liverpool 5-0, on goal difference – but again failed to leave this venue with three points; they last won here four years ago.\n“One team tried to win, one team tried to get the point but they fought hard to get that point,” said Mourinho. “They defended well, they counterattacked and in set pieces they are powerful.”\nThat was disingenuous: Stoke carried a real threat. When Mourinho’s comments were put to Mark Hughes, Stoke’s manager said: “What do you think? We were up against the best side in the Premier League judging by what they have shown so far. We didn’t allow them as much space and everything I asked the guys to do, they fulfilled.”\nStoke began the better. Almost straight from kick-off the excellent Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting forced a corner on the right. Xherdan Shaqiri took it but overhit his effort.\nThe attack set the tempo for a high-paced contest where Stoke pinned United back before the visitors exerted some control. Mourinho plumped for a 4-3-3 setup that brought in a holding midfielder, Ander Herrera, in place of an attacking one, Juan Mata, from the 2-0 win over Leicester City last time out.\nThe midfield trident repeatedly pinged passes into the front three of Romelu Lukaku, Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Marcus Rashford. One break put Lukaku in down the right and from his cross Paul Pogba backheeled the ball at Jack Butland.\nAs in the 1-0 victory over Arsenal in Stoke’s previous home league outing, Hughes’s side showed an attractive fluency. Shaqiri floated in from his right-hand berth when his fancy demanded and one move ended in a shot from the Swiss forward that De Gea had to watch carefully. A few moments later Shaqiri repeated the trick, appearing in a central area and taking aim again.\nFor the challenge of picking up where United left off before the international break Mourinho made three changes. Out went Daley Blind, Anthony Martial and Mata and in came Matteo Darmian, Rashford and Herrera. While the manager had one eye on Tuesday night’s visit of Basel in the Champions League, Mark Hughes gave Kevin Wimmer his Stoke debut, for the injured Ryan Shawcross, and Mame Biram Diouf replaced Bruno Martins Indi.\nIn a furious first-half finale, the lively Rashford forced Butland into a save from the left, Antonio Valencia’s radar was just awry with a cross, and then two goals in two minutes made the score 1-1 at the break.\nStoke sucker-punched United with a fine Choupo-Moting strike. Diouf crossed the ball in from the right after being released by a superb pass by Darren Fletcher and the forward fired home from close range. Hughes’ side lost concentration moments later as Nemanja Matic flicked on a Mkhitaryan corner to the unmarked Pogba, whose header beat Butland via a deflection off Rashford.\nThe Stoke players protested about the equaliser, arguing Rashford was in an offside position. Hughes appeared unhappy and for the second half took off Geoff Cameron for Martins Indi.\nUnited claimed this period’s first corner, again due to Rashford’s probing and though it amounted to nothing Mourinho could be pleased. The Portuguese will have been less happy at the way the full-back Darmian headed out for a corner when De Gea could have collected the ball. From Shaqiri’s delivery another mix-up in the United defence followed , from which they were lucky to escape unscathed.\nThe lead was taken by United then lost within six minutes. Joe Allen was pickpocketed by Darmian and he fed Mkhitaryan.\nThe weight and direction of the Armenian’s pass was sublime, cutting through Stoke’s defence and putting Lukaku clear. At the second attempt the Belgian scored his fourth league goal this term.\nStoke’s equaliser came from a Shaqiri corner. Phil Jones lost his footing and Choupo-Moting headed home. Mourinho was in no doubt Jones was at fault. “He knows the mistake. No problem – these things are part of the game,” the manager said.\nEighteen minutes from time Mourinho went for the jugular by introducing Martial and Mata for Rashford and Herrera. United might have grabbed a late triumph but Lukaku snatched at a close-range chance and Pogba hooked over.\nMourinho rejects Hughes handshake\nMark Hughes claimed José Mourinho failed to shake hands at the end of Stoke City’s 2-2 draw as it was a “negative result” for Manchester United’s manager. Mourinho shook hands with some Stoke City staff but not Hughes. During the match the two clashed when Mourinho wandered near his opposite number.\nAsked about the handshake Hughes said: “I pushed him because he was in my technical area. Maybe that is why he didn’t want to shake my hand. It has to be viewed as a negative result for him. Sometimes managers of top-six clubs don’t take negative results too kindly. Maybe he reacted in the wrong way.\n“In fairness I have my history with handshakes. Maybe it’s me. I’m not quite sure I seem to get involved on handshake issues, I offered my hand but José didn’t want to take it from me, maybe he was a bit upset about the result, sometimes these top managers don’t have these results too often and can get upset.”\nHughes has previously had issues regarding the post-match formality with managers including Tony Pulis (twice), Roberto Mancini, Martin Jol and Arsène Wenger.\nYet Mourinho, left, was irritated when asked about the incident. “I don’t speak about stupid things, I’m too old for that, talking about stupid things is for stupid people,” the Portuguese said. “I prefer not to answer the question because your question is a bad question. Because it looks like is my fault, is my problem. And your question is not correct, I am sorry.”\n"

        "text": "\nManchester United have been linked with Gareth Bale before. Many times. But this, perhaps, could the The One. According to Diario Gol the Welsh wizard “is not having a good season” because of “injuries that have not let him thrive”, as a result of which “his future is uncertain” – and could lie in Lancashire. “Manchester United are the team that has shown the most interest,” they write, “so much so that the Welshman has reached a verbal agreement with José Mourinho and co. However for the player Champions League football is essential, and he will not sign this summer if they are stuck in the Europa League for another season. The Welshman’s future will be decided by the performance of Mourinho’s side.” So it seems straightforward: win the Europa League and United can have Bale, as simple as that. Well, as simple as that and stumping up about £80m, though no fee is mentioned in the latest report.\n\n\n\n\n‘Disappointed’ Alexis Sánchez at the heart of Arsenal’s pivotal summer| Amy Lawrence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnited also think they are about to sign Burnley’s Michael Keane, but Liverpool believe they can beat them to it, according to the Mirror. With personal terms already agreed Jürgen Klopp hopes the defender will put pen to paper as soon as Liverpool secure a Champions League place, but the battle might turn messy because “Keane is a United fan and would jump at the chance to rejoin his beloved Red Devils if they make a concrete offer”. The Telegraph however believe that United “are confident of winning the race”, with the 25% sell-on clause they put in the deal they struck to send him to Burnley in 2015 now amounting to a decent discount on his now gallingly-expensive return. Wherever he ends up Burnley will need to replace him, and it seems they have already decided on a primary target, in the shape of the 26-year-old Barnsley captain Marc Roberts.\nKeane, meanwhile, is not the only former United player that United now want to lure back to Old Trafford: the Telegraph also report that “Mourinho is thought to have explored the possibility of re-signing Javier Hernández”, the winningly-nicknamed Mexican striker sold to Bayer Leverkusen, also in 2015. \nVirgil van Dijk, who after Keane is surely the next most gossiped-about top-flight defender, is going nowhere, according to the Southampton manager, Claude Puel. “He has a long contract and the directors want to keep him,” said the French tactician. “It’s important for us to wait until the beginning of the season to see him on the pitch with Southampton.” Bah.\nEverton want to wrap up a deal for Jordan Pickford before anyone else even has a chance to flex their chequebook, reports the Sun. Apparently a £10m offer is on the cards, with which Ronald Koeman “plans to beat a host of Premier League rivals” as well as RB Leipzig. Yeah, nice plan. Not going to work. “However,” the report continues, “Sunderland will reject the offer as they want £20m.” Or even more: the Express say they “believe a scramble for his signature will nudge his valuation towards £30m”. Everton could have Brighton’s David Stockdale for nothing, meanwhile, with the out-of-contract 31-year-old posting a series of farewell messages on social media that strongly hint he is not planning an extended stay on the south coast.\nEverton’s transfer business won’t stop there, though: they also want £12m-rated Anderlecht midfielder Leander Dendoncker. Scouts were on hand to see the 22-year-old help his side beat Zulte Waregem 2-0 on Sunday and has, says the Sun, “been on Everton’s radar for much of the season” and “previously declared his intention to go abroad”.\nIt sounds like the Belgian giants can prepare themselves for a proper summer of Premier League-related asset-stripping. Not only does their midfield also boast long-term Mill favourite Youri Tielemens, but now West Ham want to sign their Polish striker Lukasz Teodorczyk. Teodorczyk’s 28 goals in 47 games this season has put “a number of clubs across Europe” on red alert, according to the Mirror, and has secured his place on Slaven Bilic’s rather lengthy attacking want list, which also includes Daniel Sturridge, Jermain Defoe, Napoli’s Dries Mertens and Milan’s Carlos Bacca.\n"

        "text": "\nAntoine Griezmann has agreed a £280,000-a-week deal to play for Manchester United, according to one tabloid who says the Premier League side are ready to meet the £85m buy-out clause required to prise him away from Atlético Madrid. The French striker has been a long-time target of United, despite his well documented reservations about the inclement weather in the north-west of England. It is has also been suggested that his Basque wife, Erika, is not particularly keen on leaving Spain, but may change her mind upon being made aware of Manchester’s myriad tourist attractions, including the Museum of Science and Industry, Gorton Monastery and Chorlton Water Park.\n Antonio Conte is planning on introducing a few new faces to the Chelsea dressing room, and one of them may bear a striking resemblance to the visage of West Ham’s Michail Antonio. Should the West Ham midfielder pitch up at Stamford Bridge, it may well signal the end of Willian’s time as a Chelsea player. Kurt Zouma is also expected to head for the exit door and go on loan somewhere to free up a dressing-room peg for Virgil van Dijk. The Southampton central defender has an ardent admirer in Conte, who may have to shell out £50m to secure the Dutchman’s services. Southampton may also have to plan for life without full-back Ryan Bertrand, who has itchy feet and is also wanted by Chelsea. And Liverpool. \n Kelechi Iheanacho could be off to Hoffenheim, now that Manchester City have given the Bundesliga club permission to approach their young striker with a view to a loan move. Meanwhile in Scotland, the goalscoring exploits of Celtic striker Moussa Dembélé have been attracting admiring glances from around Europe. Italian side Juventus are the latest club to be linked with the Frenchman, whose 4,529 goals this season helped his side wrap up the Scottish Premiership in September. Chelsea are also interested in signing Dembélé, who is currently sidelined with injury, but had an offer rebuffed in January. \n The Mirror says the agent of Alexis Sánchez has held talks with Bayern Munich with a view to breaking his client out of the Emirates, while Arsenal fans will be thrilled to hear that Arsène Wenger came this close to signing Kylian Mbappé, before the teenage striking sensation decided to stay with Monaco. More recently, Manchester United have had a £72m bid for Mbappé turned down by the Ligue 1 leaders, a state of affairs that has been covered elsewhere by the Guardian’s man on the Manchester beat.\nWest Ham have offered Napoli €30m for Dries Mertens and have been told he isn’t for sale, while Torino striker Andrea Belotti is likely to be the subject of a massive summer bid from Manchester United. Barcelona’s failure to adequately replace Dani Alves means that Chelsea’s César Azpilicueta, Bayer Leverkusen’s Benjamin Henrichs and Arsenal’s Hector Bellerin are all persons of interest in the Camp Nou HR department. Arsenal right-back Nacho Monreal is also a wanted man, with Roma believed to be offering him sanctuary in the Italian capital. \n"
