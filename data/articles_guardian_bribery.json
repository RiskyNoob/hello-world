        "text": "\nThree former employees of the British engineering firm Rolls-Royce have pleaded guilty in America to bribery and corruption offences, the Serious Fraud Office and US Justice Department have said.\nJames Finley, Keith Barnett and Louis Zuurhout, who worked in the company’s energy division, entered the plea following parallel investigations by US and UK authorities into whether bribes were paid to secure overseas contracts over a 14-year period between 1999 and 2013.\nThey are accused of being involved in schemes whereby foreign government officials received bribes in exchange for deals that benefited a Rolls-Royce subsidiary in the US, including a contract to supply equipment and services to power a gas pipeline from central Asia to China.\nA further individual, Andreas Kohler, who worked for an international engineering consulting firm instructed by Rolls-Royce’s former customer in Kazakhstan, also entered a guilty plea. Another individual, Petros Contoguris, who worked as an intermediary for Rolls-Royce has been charged by FBI.\n“Today’s indictment and guilty pleas reveal that those associated with this corruption did knowingly conspire to break the law for their own personal gain,” said Stephen Richardson, assistant director of the FBI’s criminal investigative division. \n“No one is above the law, so let today’s announcement be a warning to those who may try to perpetrate a similar scheme that the FBI will aggressively pursue those who attempt to bribe foreign officials for an unfair advantage in the global marketplace,” he added.\nA spokesperson for the company said: “Rolls-Royce has committed to full ongoing co-operation with the Department of Justice and cannot comment on action against individuals.” Rolls sold its energy business in 2014.\nIn January this year, Rolls-Royce agreed to pay £671m in penalties after long-running investigations into claims it paid bribes to get export contracts. The settlement meant the FTSE 100 company would avoid prosecution by anti-corruption investigators in the UK, US and Brazil, but it did not exempt individuals.\nThe US Justice Department said its prosecutors and FBI agents had worked closely with their counterparts in Brazil and with the SFO. Kenneth Blanco, acting assistant attorney general of the US Justice Department’s criminal division, said the defendants would face justice, “which represents another important step towards levelling the playing field for all ethical and honest businesses.”\nThe SFO said its investigation into conduct of individuals in Rolls-Royce civil, defence, marine and former energy divisions continues, in parallel with a US Department of Justice investigation.\n"

        "text": "\nThe City had tended to be relaxed about Rolls-Royce’s run-in with the Serious Fraud Office’s bribery investigators. In part, that was because the inquiry was taking ages – it started in 2012 – and could be considered a problem for another day. It was also because the potential financial impact was almost impossible to assess from outside since both sides volunteered few details of the accusations.\nInvestors know better now. The deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) with the SFO, plus separate agreements with authorities in the US and Brazil, is big, ugly and serious. Rolls will pay a total of £671m, which is roughly equivalent to its entire expected profits for 2016. \nBut cash and profit, as Rolls shareholders have learned painfully, are not the same thing. Even before yesterday, Rolls was predicted to suffer a cash outflow for 2016 as it ramps up production of new classes of engine. For 2017, the City expected only break-even at a cash level. This penalty for bribery and corruption in foreign markets – details to be revealed in court on Tuesday – has landed at a bad moment.\nThe US and Brazil authorities want their cash quickly but the good news for Rolls, relatively speaking, is that the SFO is prepared to wait. A five-year payment schedule has been agreed, which would take the company into years when it hopes to be generating cash again at a rate of £1bn. In that regard the SFO has been lenient, perhaps with half an eye on preventing collateral damage to employees and suppliers.\nThe damage to Rolls’ reputation is harder to quantify. If you’re an optimist, it’s possible to take comfort that Rolls has substantially reduced the number of sales agents and intermediaries it uses around the world. But a £671m financial penalty is a damning scar on a company that used to be regarded as the UK’s finest manufacturer.\nAs for the SFO, it must tell us why it chose not to pursue a criminal investigation against the company. DPAs have their use in complex cases – and Rolls may fit that description – but they are not meant to become a default tactic. After the court hearing, the SFO must explain its thinking.\nImperial should spark up a pay row \nAlison Cooper has been paid roughly £18m over the course of her six full years as chief executive of Imperial Brands, the cancer-stick company known as Imperial Tobacco until its diversionary change of name. Call it an average of £3m a year, or £1m every four months. Not bad, especially as the trend has been firmly upwards. Last year she got £5.5m.\nCooper would also appear to have a strong incentive to remain loyal to her employer of 17 years. She owns shares in Imperial worth £6.5m, accumulated in most part through the incentive-based components of her pay package. She also has unvested share awards worth £12m at current prices and, on recent form, could expect to scoop about two-thirds of that pot.\nIs she loyal, though? David Haines, Imperial’s chairman, seems to doubt it. He worries that pay for Imperial executives is “significantly below the average for companies of our size” and thinks this creates “an unnecessary risk with regard to retaining our senior team”.\nHe proposes cranking up the maximum Cooper and others can receive in a given year. Three years ago this was £5.8m in Cooper’s case and has been increased annually. Haines now wants her to chase £8.5m. But, note, a bigger prize doesn’t imply meaningfully stiffer targets. “We would not wish to disguise the fact that our proposals allow us to pay more for the delivery of the levels of performance seen in recent years,” Haines concedes. There you have it: a pay increase to keep up with the Joneses, or other FTSE 30 companies.\nImperial has performed well for investors (though not as strongly as BAT, the other big London-listed gasper merchant). But has Cooper threatened to quit? Has any executive? And why does Haines think Imperial employs nobody capable of filling her or other executives’ shoes? Answers to these questions would be more useful than Haines’ pious bleat about how he is “sympathetic” – just not in Imperial’s case – to concerns about pay increases which do not reflect performance.\nCity fund managers, even once-shy BlackRock, tell us they want to clamp down on “benchmarking” awards for bosses already earning many millions. Imperial’s plan would seem to be a classic example of the ratchet factor at work. If its proposal passes next month, you’ll know the fund managers don’t really mean what they say.\n"

        "text": "\nFor Rolls-Royce, the company, the book is now almost closed. It has apologised “unreservedly” in court for the bribery and corruption in its midst in the period 1989 to 2013. It will pay £671m in penalties, the lion’s share in the UK. It has changed its senior management. And, under the terms of the deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) with the Serious Fraud Office, it will improve its behaviour on pain of getting properly whacked.\nBut the affair cannot be left to lie there. Read the statement of facts in the case, and consider the words of Sir Brian Leveson in the high court as he approved the DPA, to appreciate the size of this scandal. Rolls-Royce’s internal investigation, we learn, involved disciplinary proceedings against 38 individuals in its civil aerospace, energy and marine divisions, leading to 11 employees leaving the company during the disciplinary process and six being dismissed. Others have suffered sanctions short of dismissal.\nThat is a sizeable tally but naturally understates matters since disciplinary proceedings could only be taken against those still on the company’s payroll in 2013 and afterwards. The corruption spanned three decades, remember. And look at Rolls-Royce’s review of the intermediaries it used to win contracts in foreign markets. The company examined 250 relationships and suspended 88 intermediaries.\nIf that suggests a past culture where corruption was completely out of control, so do the words of the judge in his concluding remarks: “My reaction when first considering these papers was that if Rolls-Royce were not to be prosecuted in the context of such egregious criminality over decades, involving countries around the world, making truly vast corrupt payments and, consequentially, even greater profits, then it was difficult to see when any company would be prosecuted.”\nLeveson nevertheless approved the DPA because he accepted that Rolls-Royce is “no longer the company that once it was” and its new board and executive team has sought “to clear out all the disreputable practices”. That seems pragmatic and correct: there is no point in destroying Rolls-Royce, damaging its suppliers and undermining the UK’s defence capabilities.\nBut two questions still loom large: who, at the top at Rolls-Royce, knew what was going on and when? Tuesday’s documents contained no names but, again, the judge’s remarks were powerful. He referred to “most serious breaches” of the criminal law “some of which implicated senior management and, on the face of it, controlling minds of the company”. Note, too, the detail that the company, after starting its own investigations in 2013, supplied the SFO with “a report concerning conduct Rolls-Royce had known about since 2010 and previously (under different leadership) decided not to notify”.\nUntil the controlling minds at Rolls-Royce in the relevant period explain their conduct, consider this tale incomplete. A company regarded as the UK’s finest has been disgraced. Now we need to know who let it happen.\nBAT’s Reynolds takeover shows Big Tobacco is far from burnt out\nIt’s amazing now to recall that when British American Tobacco sold its US subsidiary Brown & Williamson to RJ Reynolds in 2004, taking a 42% stake in exchange, the deal was worth only $3bn (£2.42bn at current rates). Wind forward to the present day and the numbers have become extraordinary. BAT is now buying the remaining 58% of the restyled Reynolds American, owner of Camel and Newport, for almost $50bn.\nOne must adjust for the $4.7bn BAT injected to maintain its 42% holding after Reynolds’ takeover of Lorillard, another US fags firm, in 2015. Even so, the inflation in valuations shows what a wonderful investment Big Tobacco became once the threat of ruinous class-action litigation was removed. That era began with a grand settlement with 46 US states in 1998 and was later cemented by various rulings that limited punitive damages.\nThe share prices tell the story. Back in 2004, Reynolds’ shares traded around the $8 mark, versus a valuation of $59.64 in Tuesday’s deal. BAT’s shares, in the same period, have improved from £9 to £46 with barely a wheeze along the way. There is cash – and plenty of it – in selling to customers who tend to remain loyal until they kick the habit or die. And, in the age of low interest rates, there have been easy opportunities to spice up returns to shareholders via the use of debt.\nIs there any mileage left, though? BAT is betting there is because it is buying Reynolds at almost 17 times its earnings, thought to be the highest price ever paid for a large tobacco firm. That ratio looks aggressive, especially as promised cost savings of $400m are small in the context of the deal. But BAT chief executive Nicandro Durante could probably justify the punt on four grounds.\nFirst, the effective oligopoly in the US market means cigarette prices can continue to be increased gently. Second, there’s a chance Donald Trump will cut corporate taxes, which would do wonders for Reynolds’ bottom-line earnings. Third, the cigarette giants are well on the way to controlling the vaping market (which “satisfies different consumer moments”, in BAT’s grim language), so the threat of major upheaval in earnings is slight. Fourth, it’s hard to go too far wrong in cigarettes; it will take five years to achieve returns in the US that beat the cost of capital, thinks BAT, but it can be confident of getting there eventually.\nIn short, this mega-deal suggests Big Tobacco’s winning run can continue for some time yet. It didn’t seem possible in the litigation-heavy fog of 2004; now it seems probable.\n"

        "text": "\nMPs have called on the government to consider legal action against the former chief executive of the public body building the new high-speed rail network, over £1.76m in redundancy payments made in direct contravention of civil service rules.\nHS2 Ltd, which is overseeing the £55bn project, paid £2.76m to 94 individuals, while the statutory redundancy terms should have kept the bill at £1m.\nMPs on the public accounts committee said the payouts were “a shocking waste of taxpayers’ money”. \nThe National Audit Office found that HS2 Ltd’s former chief executive, Simon Kirby, was emailed in April 2016 by a senior civil servant at the Department for Transport expressly disallowing the redundancy payouts proposed.\nThe email was not forwarded and an HR director subsequently briefed the board and executive committee that the DfT had approved the scheme. An audit later found documents had been altered in an apparent attempt to cover up mistakes. \nIn a damning report, the committee said that HS2 Ltd “lacks basic financial controls … heightening the risk of fraud and financial errors”. It continued: “We remain concerned that the relationship between the DfT and HS2 Ltd was not robust enough to prevent [the payouts] and that ultimately Kirby has not been held to account for his actions.\n“HS2 Ltd needs to make significant improvements to demonstrate probity, value for money and appropriate anti-fraud, bribery and corruption.”\n\n\n Q&A Tell us how you are affected by the HS2 route  \n\n\n Show \n\n\n Hide  \n\nWe’d like to hear from you if you, your community or your business is affected by the planned route of HS2.\nYou can share your story using our encrypted form here, or by sending your pictures and videos to the Guardian securely via WhatsApp by adding the contact +44(0)7867825056. We will feature some of your contributions in our reporting.\n\n\n\n\nWas this helpful?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you for your feedback.\n\n\n\n\nGeoffrey Clifton-Brown, a Conservative MP on the committee, said the payouts looked to amount to “a wilful misuse of public funds”. He said: “To ask for a derogation from the normal civil service terms for redundancy, to have that refused by the department, and then go ahead seems like a wilful misuse of public funds. This money is lost – it can’t be reclaimed.”\nHe said: “It is up to lawyers to decided what, if any, charge should be appropriate. I am calling for the DfT to take legal advice if any further action could be taken – and if the advice is that Kirby can be pursued, he should be.” \nKirby, now chief operating officer of Rolls-Royce, said: “I did not approve the payments at issue and deny any allegation of wrongdoing. I have had no contact from either the NAO or DfT on the audit of HS2’s accounts and redundancy payments.\n“I left HS2 in December last year and the decision to make senior managers redundant, and under what terms, was not made until after I left. While I do not recall whether I forwarded one specific email from David Prout to others within HS2, the issue of statutory severance was well known within HS2 and I recall regular contact between HS2 and DfT – at a number of levels – on this specific issue.”\nA DfT spokesperson said: “We have made clear to HS2 Ltd in the strongest terms that we expect them to always meet their obligations and responsibilities to the taxpayer.\n“As the NAO said this was a failure in the internal process at HS2 Ltd that resulted in these payments being made without approval in place.\n“The Department has received legal advice that bringing a claim against Mr Kirby for breaching his duties and responsibilities as CEO and director of HS2 Ltd would not be justified.”\nHS2 Ltd, a government-owned company, was established in 2009 to build the proposed high-speed rail link between London, Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds. \nThe payouts were offered after the firm decided to relocate its main office from London to Birmingham. An NAO report earlier this year found that some individuals received £200,000 rather than the £95,000 cap, and warned of troubling “culture and behaviours” at the firm. \nA spokesperson said HS2 Ltd said it would review the MPs’ recommendations, and that the payments were “a serious error”. \nHe said: “HS2 takes its responsibility for spending taxpayers’ money extremely seriously so when we get things wrong we will hold our hands up. We are now implementing all of the NAO’s recommendations in full and [new chief executive] Mark Thurston and the HS2 executive team will ensure this doesn’t happen again.”\nLabour’s shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, said: “Yet again a lack of oversight of HS2 Ltd has resulted in a waste of taxpayers’ cash. The secretary of state needs to take responsibility and spell out what he will do to prevent any more public money being squandered.” \n"

Prout spelled out in capitals: “This is an absolute RED LINE for us. Company employees are not civil servants. They have to take the rough with the smooth.”\nHe added: “If this proposals [sic] surfaces in terms of a written proposition that gets anywhere near the top of the office here it will do enormous reputational damage to the company.”\nMPs last week called on the government to consider legal action against Kirby, who has since left HS2 to become chief operating officer of Rolls-Royce.

It couldn’t have been stronger or clearer.”\nAfter the email was sent, an HR director of HS2, Peter Gregory, briefed the board and executive committee that the DfT had approved the scheme. \nThe payouts have cast a pall over HS2, whose opponents have already long alleged that the £55.7bn budget to build the high-speed rail network is liable to spiral upwards. The PAC report warned that HS2 Ltd “lacks basic financial controls … heightening the risk of fraud and financial errors”. It recommended that “HS2 Ltd needs to make significant improvements to demonstrate probity, value for money and appropriate anti-fraud, bribery and corruption.”\nWhile MPs said legal action should be considered against individuals, the DfT said it had received legal advice that bringing a claim against Kirby for breaching his duties would not be justified.\nKirby said in a statement last week: “I did not approve the payments at issue and deny any allegation of wrongdoing.

        "text": "\nBillions of pounds have been laundered through the City of London, despite Britain remaining one of the safest and cleanest places in the world to do business, the home secretary has said.\nAmber Rudd issued the warning as she announced plans for a new national economic crime centre, with the power to task the Serious Fraud Office to investigate the worst cases of fraud, money laundering and corruption.\nThe national economic crime centre will be based within the National Crime Agency and will oversee the national police response to financial crime, backed by greater intelligence and analytical capabilities.\nThe move, which will include naming a Home Office minister responsible for tackling economic crime, is part of a revised anti-corruption strategy published on Monday that targets “corrupt insiders” in sectors including policing, prisons and border force, and pledges greater transparency over who owns and controls businesses to improve trust in Britain as a place to do business.\nThe Guardian’s disclosure of the Panama Papers has already led to the creation of a government taskforce using the data to improve official understanding of the complex and opaque structures used to mask offshore tax evasion. The revised strategy document says that by October, a joint financial analysis centre had opened civil and criminal investigations into more than 66 individuals for suspected tax evasion.\nThe latest official figures suggest that £90bn a year in crime proceeds are laundered each year in Britain, including money from large-scale drug dealing and people trafficking. It is also estimated that fraud costs a further £6.8bn a year – the equivalent of £225 a household.\nThe home secretary said: “Today we are taking action against economic crime, and by that I mean the high-level crime, the billions that have been laundered through the City of London, making sure we reduce that and we are very clear we expect higher standards of integrity in this country.\n“But [it is] also about everyday economic crime that affects everybody. I don’t know a single person who doesn’t know somebody who knows somebody who has been the victim of some sort of online fraud. On those two elements, high-level economic crime and everyday economic crime, we’re taking action to make sure we reduce it in this country,” said Rudd.\nShe will personally chair a new economic crime strategy board to drive action and Conservative MP John Penrose has been appointed the “anti-corruption champion” by the prime minister.\nRudd stressed that economic crime was not victimless. \n\n\n\n\nJeremy Corbyn to take aim at tax avoidance in speech at UN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong the victims was Karen Mackie from Aldershot, Hampshire, who lost her solicitors practice and her home after she fell prey to a phishing scam whereby fraudsters pretending to be from her bank phoned and asked about an issue with her accounts.\nThe 56-year-old was told to hang up and ring the number on the back of her card, but the scammers had kept the line open and, in the belief she was through to the anti-fraud team at Natwest, did as she was instructed, transferring thousands of pounds into the criminals’ accounts.\n “I became quite ill afterwards as a result of it,” she said. “I lost my practice because my insurance wouldn’t pay out, as it turned out they were in financial difficulty. In other circumstances, the insurance company of the solicitors have paid out. We subsequently lost our home this year. The long-term effects just continue.”\nThe government’s new, more robust approach to money laundering, bribery and corruption includes new powers for the national economic crime centre to coordinate the private sector response as well as directly task the SFO. The revised strategy sets out six priorities, including: reducing the insider threat in high-risk domestic sectors; strengthening Britain as a financial centre; reducing corruption in public procurement and grants; and improving the business environment globally.\n“To secure our future prosperity, we must do all that we can to make sure that Britain remains one of the safest and cleanest places in the world to do business,” said Rudd. “Our security and prosperity are inextricably linked. As the UK prepares to leave the EU, we have an opportunity to leverage our reputation for integrity and fair play as we establish new trading relationships.”\n"

        "text": "\nOperating via online marketplaces and auction sites can put you in touch with customers across the globe. These marketplaces often sort the regulatory, currency and customs issues on your behalf. But when it comes to dealing with a new business outside of the UK, how do you set up a more formal and long-lasting agreement?\nLet’s not beat about the bush: overseas expansion is tough. Trade shows, marketing campaigns and foreign travel can be expensive and seem out of reach, making breaking into the big retailers nigh on impossible. Therefore, online marketplaces have given millions of small businesses a glimpse through a window to new customer bases.\nTo go further, you need to find out about the different country or jurisdiction you’re interested in trading with, so get good local advice. “Talk to someone from a strong international network and find a good, local adviser who can help you make sense of the local laws, legislations, taxes, and ways of doing business,” says Gareth Magee, a partner at accountants Scott-Moncrieff, with expertise in international expansion.\nBut do your homework – which will involve researching the political, economic and cultural differences. Appreciate that there will be differences, but try not to let that get you in a spin. “Don’t let differences become barriers,” says Magee.\nIf there’s a particular company you’d like to work with, then run some proper credit checks and undertake some due diligence – know who you are talking to. Ask for references too. “Do a Google search, call them,” says Magee. “It may sound old-school, but a call will give you a really strong sense of how they do business.”\nAvoid limiting working relationships one-to-one, engage with several people from the outset and build a network of connections.\nThen there’s managing risk. You should understand local bribery and corruption rules – don’t fall foul or offend. Get advice in terms of what your foreign exchange exposure might be and about how you can mitigate against this. Consider whether you will need export finance or protection against overseas bad debts. And be prepared to travel – not just once. “There’s absolutely no substitute for face to face. Virtual just won’t do it,” reckons Magee.\nGabriela Castro-Fontoura is a director at export consultancy Sunny Sky Solutions, and is experienced in doing business in Latin America. She says you must never rely on emails as contractually binding. Contracts need to be signed by a ‘public notary’ – a recognised third-party with some power to authentic documents and agreements.\n“Either build relationships strong enough to trust each other, or if you need to put something valuable at risk – such as stock – make sure you’re legally protected in that country,” says Castro-Fontoura.\nOn distribution, she says you should never give exclusivity to an overseas distributor, excited as you might be about accessing their market, until they’ve proved themselves.\nAlso, be careful what geographical area you assign to a distributor. “I have seen UK SMEs give a US distributor free rein in Latin America, a region of 600 million people and 20 countries, when in general there is no chance they could cover it.” \nCurrency strategy is also vital, says Castro-Fontoura. Latin American firms will be happy to trade with you in US dollars, but “might be very reluctant” to engage in sterling, a currency most hardly know or understand. \nAnother issue is currency fluctuation. If foreign currencies devalue, it becomes much more expensive to pay you. “Invest more in online marketing when the exchange is favourable to your client – even if you put a lot of money into marketing.”\nFinally, she warns you to think carefully about customs. Some countries don’t have an issue but others can be a nightmare – even if simply transporting samples. “Make sure you communicate with your client to understand what information they need on the invoice and if there’s any documentation you can send while the goods are being shipped to speed up paperwork when the goods finally arrive,” Castro-Fontoura explains.\nContent on this page is paid for and provided by Kia Fleet, sponsor of the Guardian Small Business Network Accessing Expertise hub.\n"

She negotiated an “agenda for growth” agreement with the union just before privatisation in 2013 and it is a clause in that document that the company is now trying to enforce.\n\n\n\n\nRoyal Mail seeks injunction to halt 48-hour postal strike\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn essence, Royal Mail committed not to move jobs offshore, not to outsource roles and to limit the use zero-hours contracts. In return, it argues, the CWU agreed that five weeks of arbitration must take place before a strike can go ahead. Given how much weight Royal Mail attached to the agreement – at privatisation and subsequently – Greene needs to be able to show the wording was legally watertight. \nThe CWU’s stance is that mediation has already happened and that Royal Mail is deliberately misinterpreting the 2013 agreement. There was a mediator present during the 18 months of talks that failed to reach a deal on pay and pensions, it argues. Union leaders, too, will look foolish if their legal arguments fail and next week’s strike has to be abandoned. The CWU signed the “agenda for growth” document; it is not a general piece of trades union legislation.\nA battle in the high court probably won’t calm the mood on either side, whatever is decided, but the loser will start on the back foot.\nIoD governance report could spur wrong kind of debate\nIs GlaxoSmithKline the worst-governed company in the FTSE 100 index? Can Barclays really be the fourth best?\nThe Institute of Directors thinks so – or, rather, its Good Governance Report has produced these rankings for 2017 based on 47 “indicators” of good governance weighted according to significance. It all sounds terribly objective and mathematical until you examine the breakdown of the scores and realise nobody applied a filter for common sense.\nWhy is Glaxo ranked a long way below Rolls-Royce and BT for “audit risk and external accountability”? The engine-maker in January agreed to pay £671m in penalties to settle allegations of bribery and corruption brought by the Serious Fraud Office. In the same month, BT confessed to a £530m black hole in its subsidiary in Italy. Glaxo’s big Chinese bribery scandal was three years ago and it has suffered no similar indignity since. How can the pharmaceuticals firm still be bottom of the pile?\nOther weird findings include a near-perfect score for Imperial Brands on “shareholder relations” even though shareholders in the tobacco group revolted over a plan to give the chief executive a big pay rise. Meanwhile, Provident Financial has illustrated how these reports can be a hostage to events. The doorstep lender received its near-perfect score for “remuneration and reward” just before its share price collapsed and the chief executive, Peter Crook, who had been paid £30m over five years, was ousted.\nAs for Barclays, fourth place is clearly better than the last place it received a couple of years ago. Yet the high ranking ignores the fact that its chief executive, Jes Staley, is under investigation by the financial regulator for the serious governance breach of attempting to unmask a whistleblower.\nPerhaps one shouldn’t be too hard on the IoD, which promotes good governance more actively than the CBI and has been strong in denouncing lax standards at Sports Direct and BHS. But this report may fail in its attempt “to stimulate an ongoing debate about the importance of good corporate governance”. These rankings are more likely to provoke baffled cries of “Do you actually follow the news?”\nDeutsche Börse move highlights risk of lacking transition deal\nIt is possible that Deutsche Börse’s attempt to lure part of the euro clearing market to Frankfurt has nothing to do with Brexit. The strategy could be influenced by financial market regulations that are changing anyway. But Brexit seems the most likely spur. Amid the non-agreement over transitional arrangements, Frankfurt sees an opportunity to grab a slice of a lucrative market from the London Stock Exchange, which currently dominates the clearing game.\nYou’d still bet on the LSE to defend itself robustly since Deutsche’s approach seems to be copycat profit-sharing offer to the investment banks. Yet this saga should serve as another reminder about the risks to the City of entering 2018 without a transitional deal. Banks don’t want to trigger their contingency plans, but they are also obliged to cover the danger of the EU writing rules that force some financial activities to shift location. The longer this goes on, the greater the risk to City jobs.\n"

        "text": "\nAn established Conservative party strategy is to play the immigration card whenever it is in trouble. Today is no different. This time it is enrolling banks and building societies to carry out checks for illegal immigrants. Yes, the banks that crashed the economy and are still busy hiding more than $13tn of their liabilities are somehow expected to trawl through 70m accounts to find illegal immigrants.\n\n\n\n\nUK banks to check 70m bank accounts in search for illegal immigrants\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow will the financial sector identify illegal immigrants beyond doubt, assuming that they have opened bank accounts? Is there going to be racial profiling and stereotyping? Will banks be given access to government databases? And what protections will prevent abuse of privacy and commercial exploitation of the personal details of UK residents and some 40 million annual visitors to the country? The government has no idea of the number of illegal immigrants. Visa overstayers may leave a moderate paper trail, but here are no current statistics about the number of illegal immigrants.\nThe government’s own position is that “it is impossible to quantify accurately the number of people who are in the country illegally”. The Home Office itself does not have adequate systems or records. Recently it admitted having sent letters threatening to deport EU nationals legally present in the UK. If banks acted upon the government’s poor data and froze bank accounts, how much hardship would that cause?\nIt’s folly to rely on banks. They have an appalling record of compliance with any recognisable standards of decency and honesty. Look at any number of scandals – the Panama Papers, HSBC, Luxembourg leaks, and see how UK-based banks present themselves as engines of global tax avoidance/evasion, money laundering, bribery and corruption.\nIdentification of illegal immigrants will require the development of complex systems of internal controls. But banks lack good systems of controls for dealing with even their normal trade. Under the anti-money-laundering laws all banks are required to verify the identity of their clients. Yet how many human traffickers, slave traders and rogue landlords manage to process their gains through bank accounts? Numerous shell companies with no identifiable directors or shareholders are conduits for bribery, corruption and sanctions busting, but via functioning bank accounts.\n\n\n\n\n \n\nInvest in the public services to tackle gangmasters. Raid employers who run sweatshops\n\n\nPublic admonishment, fines and investigations should prompt banks to upgrade their systems, but that doesn’t seem to happen. Banks deal with money. Their moral compass and economic systems are not equipped to spot illegal immigrants. But more than that, illegality, at least when it comes to richer customers, is a source of profits. If the government really wants to tackle illegal immigration then it needs to invest in the public services to tackle the human traffickers, rogue landlords and gangmasters who bring illegal immigrants into the country. It needs to raid employers who run sweatshops and profit from the blood of innocent individuals, often paying them low wages.\nMinisters could get tough and enforce national minimum wage laws, prosecuting those who fail to meet their legal obligations. There have been only 13 successful prosecutions. The government is neither fair nor serious. This announcement is more proof of that.\n• Prem Sikka is emeritus professor of accounting at the University of Essex\n"

There are Christmas lights, an ice skating rink and hot sausage stalls in the shadow of one of the most uncompromising political regimes of the modern era.\n\n\n\n\nRussia 2018 World Cup: the complete guide to all the stadiums\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat contrast between fun and fear will be embodied by next summer’s World Cup. A chance to watch Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, to follow England around this vast country but also the knowledge that the host country has serious questions to answer on its attitudes to race, sexuality and human rights. It is understood Vladimir Putin, although not a football fan, will provide an opening address at the draw, keen presumably to take advantage of the political capital on offer.\nFor all the understandable wariness of Russia 2018, Moscow has offered a window into what the World Cup may be like when it gets under way on 14 June. Access has been closely controlled by the security services but an army of volunteers, decked in red, demonstrated an eagerness to please and experiences have been mostly positive.\nThe foreign media, often cast as an enemy faction by Putin, were treated to a special performance by the Moscow State Academic Theatre and offered gifts of notepads and Russian dolls from the 11 host cities.\n“There is an excitement about the World Cup,” one local said. “People are looking forward to it and want to put on a show – but perhaps not as much as before the Olympics when it was thought it could change how the world viewed Russia. They’ve learned how wrong they were.”\nSochi 2014 and the systematic doping that blighted that event and at least the three preceding Olympics has only reinforced negative views of Russian culture, its attitude towards sport and fair play. On Thursday evening, as Gordon Banks and Fabio Cannavaro spoke of their delight at being chosen by Fifa as draw assistants, news filed through of another two positive drugs tests from Russian athletes at London 2012. Of 226 samples collected from Russian athletes who participated in London and retested, 21 have been dirty.\nVitaly Mutko, the country’s sports minister at that time, is now not only Putin’s deputy but the head of the Russian FA and will be a key figure at the draw. This is despite the publication this week of diaries belonging to the Russian doping whistleblower Grigory Rodchenkov, a former head of the Moscow drug lab, which detail meetings with Mutko and offer the strongest evidence yet that Mutko fully knew of the systematic doping programme.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  The rehearsal for the 2018 World Cup draw at the Kremlin. Photograph: Matthias Hangst/Bongarts/Getty Images\n\n\nWhile Mutko may be on borrowed time pending further revelations, it is too late now for there to be any realistic prospect of Russia being stripped of the World Cup.\nAt the hotel where Fifa executives are staying, Michel D’Hooghe, the chairman of the medical committee, was at pains to insist doping control would be kept out of the hands of the hosts.\n“The anti-doping control will be done by medical officers of Fifa not Russia – nothing will be in the hands of the Russian organisers,” he said. “With the rumours around Russia it’s one reason more to say we give nothing of the doping control to Russian doctors, to the Russian authorities, to the local organising committee.”\nNevertheless, there is understandably widespread disquiet about a country guilty of such craven cheating being given the honour of hosting football’s biggest showpiece.\nEven before the doping programme was exposed, the way Russia came to win the 2018 bid was the subject of much consternation. It was Gary Lineker who revealed to a group of British journalists that England would be knocked out in the first round of voting despite being among the favourites to host.\nHe broke ranks from assembled dignitaries in Zurich in December 2010 to express his disgust. Most of the Fifa executives who voted on Russia and Qatar 2022 have been exposed as having been part of an organisation characterised by bribery and corruption.\nIt was only six months ago Lineker tweeted: “Fifa bidding process created a murky world where favours/bribes were just thrown around. Stinks.”\nSo his decision to accept the governing body’s invitation to co-host the draw alongside the TV presenter Maria Komandnaya prompted some raised eyebrows.\n\n\n\n\nWorld Cup 2018 draw: how it all works and which teams England should avoid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome commentators believe Lineker’s involvement is wrong because it gives a cloak of legitimacy to the governing body. If Lineker, once such an ardent critic, is willing to align himself with it then things cannot be so bad, surely?\nThe golden boot winner defended himself. “There is a new guard,” he said. “If it were still Blatter and his brigade I would not have done it. I was approached by [Fifa’s technical development director] Marco van Basten and [deputy general secretary] Zvonimir Boban. They are two good football people. I hope and think Fifa is changing. New people deserve a chance to prove it is, we will see.”\nWhether the world will offer the same olive branch to Russia as Lineker has to Fifa remains to be seen.\n"

        "text": "\nThe Foreign Office is immersed in a major lobbying row after it emerged that a senior official sought to help a British tobacco company to avoid paying tax owed to one of the world’s poorest countries.\nAlison Blake, the British high commissioner to Bangladesh, has been accused of lobbying on behalf of British American Tobacco (BAT) after it sought her help in a long-running battle with the country’s revenue authorities.\nThe extraordinary intervention has provoked anger among health organisations and transparency campaigners, both in the UK and in Bangladesh, who say that it breaches strict World Health Organisation rules on lobbying.\nBAT is disputing a £170m claim for unpaid VAT brought by the government of Bangladesh against its subsidiary BATB. The claim has been recognised in the country’s courts but BAT, in a letter to Blake seeking her support, boasted of its “proud history of more than 105 years of investment and revenue contribution in Bangladesh”.\nThe company described the demand as “baseless” and signalled that it may take the matter to the international court of arbitration.\nShortly after she received the letter, Blake wrote on 6 August to the Bangladeshi government repeating the arguments made by BAT. She said: “I am writing regarding the long pending VAT case of British American Tobacco Bangladesh which we have discussed a number of times before and on those occasions I felt assured that your honourable office was determined to resolve the matter.”\nBlake highlighted the fact that BAT paid more to the exchequer than any other company last year. She also noted that the high commission was aware of government legal opinions stating that there was “no scope to hold the manufacturer liable to pay VAT on a retrospective basis”.\nShe noted that the Bangladeshi finance minister had in the past discussed meeting the law minister and attorney general to consider an out-of-court settlement “but somehow these meetings have not been held”.\nThis is not the first time the Foreign Office has found its relationship with BAT under scrutiny.\nIn 2015 the British high commissioner in Pakistan attended a lobbying meeting between BAT and the country’s finance ministry at which the company protested about proposed tobacco control measures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  The Bangladeshi organisation Progga says that tobacco kills around 100,000 people a year Photograph: MUNIR UZ ZAMAN/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\nIn 2013 the Foreign Office was forced to issue new guidelines to its staff about its relationship with the tobacco industry following a previous scandal when the British ambassador to Panama intervened on BAT’s behalf in 2012.\nThe guidelines stated that officials must not “engage with foreign governments on behalf of the tobacco industry, except in cases where local policies could be considered protectionist or discriminatory”.\nThe guidelines also forbade officials from seeking to “encourage investment in the tobacco industry, or provide any assistance in helping tobacco companies influence non-discriminatory local business policies to their advantage”.\nThe UK is also a signatory to WHO guidelines prohibiting officials from acting in the interests of big tobacco.\nProgga, a Bangladeshi nonprofit organisation that promotes transparency, said it was dismayed by the Foreign Office’s intervention. A spokesman said: “We appreciate the development initiatives of British government in Bangladesh but the attempts to settle the BATB tax issue out of court by the British high commissioner, Ms Alison Blake, is entirely undesirable. Tobacco kills around 100,000 people annually and cripples around 382,000 in Bangladesh, and BATB owns the largest share [of the market] here.”\n\n\n\n\n \n\nBAT is under investigation by the SFO . . . so what is a senior diplomat doing acting as its lobbyist?\n\nDeborah Arnott, the Ash charity\n\n\n\nAs smoking declines in the west, big tobacco is seeking to expand into countries such as Bangladesh that have not implemented tobacco control measures. But BAT’s actions have provoked controversy.\nAllegations that it was involved in bribery and corruption in Africa are being investigated by the Serious Fraud Office. However, a spokeswoman for BAT defended its relationship with the high commissioner.\n“We have done nothing wrong here,” she said. “It’s incorrect to say that WHO guidelines prohibit all engagement between governments and the tobacco industry; in fact, they caution governments to ensure that all operations and activities of the tobacco industry are transparent.”\nDeborah Arnott, chief executive of the health charity Ash, said: “The Foreign Office has instructed all its diplomats not to act as tobacco company lobbyists. Indeed they are supposed to assist tobacco companies in complying with foreign government laws or regulations, not try and overturn them. This case is particularly egregious as BAT has enlisted the British high commissioner to pressurise the Bangladesh government to overturn a legal decision handed down by the courts.\n“This is a company currently under investigation by the UK’s Serious Fraud Office over allegations of bribery in east Africa, so what on earth is a senior diplomat doing acting as its lobbyist?”\nA Foreign Office spokesman defended the commissioner. “It is entirely appropriate that the UK government supports British businesses overseas. Our actions were in line with guidelines and the letter in question highlighted the original legal opinion that there was no legal basis for retrospective VAT.”\n"

The Duke of Cambridge called it “one of the United Kingdom’s great global companies”.\nThe investigation into Rolls is likely to concern ministers – a situation that has echoes of the controversy that enveloped the SFO’s inquiry into the arms manufacturer BAE Systems.

It emerged in 2014 that the Department of Justice in the US had opened its own inquiry.\nA legal source said 30 investigators in the UK were now focused on the multinational’s use of agents, or middlemen, to clinch export contracts in a number of countries across several strands of its business. \nPart of the SFO investigation is likely to centre on Rolls-Royce’s relationship with Unaoil, a Monaco-based firm that has been accused of using bribes to win contracts in a series of countries for dozens of multinationals.\nThis year, the SFO opened a criminal investigation into Unaoil over allegations of bribery, corruption and money laundering.

Admitting in its annual report two years ago that the allegations were a “body blow”, Rolls-Royce has said its employees now have more direct responsibility for selling its products.\nIn a statement, Rolls-Royce plc said: “We have made it clear that Rolls-Royce will not tolerate business misconduct or inappropriate behaviour of any kind and in recent years we have intensified our focus on ethics and compliance, which are foundations of our culture.”\n“Our global code of conduct, which applies to all of our employees, makes it clear that we have zero tolerance to bribery and corruption.\n“In 2014, our anti-bribery and corruption compliance team, working with internationally respected independent authority on ethics and compliance Lord Gold, completed a thorough review and update of the group’s anti-bribery and corruption policies including those concerning the use of advisers and intermediaries.”\nThe SFO said it “is conducting major investigations into allegations of bribery and corruption involving both Rolls-Royce and Unaoil.

        "text": "\nPark Geun-hye, the deposed South Korean president, has denounced her bribery and corruption trial as “political revenge” after her entire legal team resigned in protest against her treatment in detention.\nSpeaking publicly for the first time since her trial began six months ago, Park told a hearing at the Seoul central district court on Monday: “I was supposed to be released today, but the court issued another arrest warrant … I can’t accept its decision.”\nLate last week the court extended her detention until April next year, citing a potential risk that she would attempt to destroy evidence. Her first six-month period of detention expired on Monday.\n“My lawyers and I felt helpless,” Park said, according to the Korea Times. “I have lost faith that the court will do a fair job in accordance with the constitution and conscience.”\n\n\n\n\nFrom president to prisoner: Park Geun-Hye's new life behind bars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn an outburst that appeared to be directed at her successor as South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, Park claimed her treatment was politically motivated.\n“I hope I will be the last victim of political revenge in the name of the rule of law,” she said.\nPark’s intervention comes after international lawyers acting for the former president approached the UN in an attempt to secure her conditional release from “inhuman and degrading” detention to undergo urgent medical treatment.\nA legal team led by Rodney Dixon QC said they were “dismayed” by the court’s decision to extend Park’s detention by a further six months.\nPark, who was arrested soon after her impeachment in March, faces a possible life sentence if found guilty of bribery – the most serious charge – in a case that has also ensnared the heir to the Samsung technology empire and dozens of senior politicians and business figures.\nThe former dictator’s daughter, who was elected South Korea’s first female president in 2012, is accused of colluding with her close friend, Choi Soon-sil, to secure tens of millions of dollars in bribes from businesses in return for political favours.\nLee Jae-yong, the acting chairman of Samsung, was sentenced to five years in prison in August after being found guilty of bribery, embezzlement and other crimes. He is appealing against the verdict, claiming that Park coerced him into helping Choi.\nA pale-looking Park, who arrived at the court on Monday in handcuffs, insisted she was innocent.\n“I never accepted or granted requests for favours while in office,” she said. “I believe it has been fully revealed during the course of the trial that the corresponding suspicions are not true.”\nPark said the last six months had been “a horrible and miserable time” during which she had “endured pain in my body and mind”.\nShe added: “I had trust in a person who later betrayed me. As a result, I have lost my honour and everything else in life.”\nHer international legal team – which is separate from the defence lawyers who have been representing her in her corruption trial – has asked the UN working group on arbitrary detention to recommend that she be granted a conditional release, although the ultimate decision rests with the South Korean courts.\n“The UN is looking at our application urgently and the South Korean authorities need to respond,” Dixon told the Guardian. “We have asked the UN to address the matter as swiftly as possible because every day counts.”\nPark, 65, suffers from chronic lower back pain, osteoarthritis in her knee and shoulder joints, and Addison’s disease, a rare disorder of the adrenal glands.\n“Our point that we’ve been highlighting to the UN is that her condition has certainly been aggravated by being in detention and that if she doesn’t get proper medical attention it’ll only get worse,” said Dixon, a human rights lawyer based in London.\n“If you could release her you could have very clear conditions in place – you could even put her under house arrest – and her health conditions could be treated.”\nIn a submission to the UN, the lawyers said Park’s ongoing detention, despite her deteriorating health, “constituted a violation of her fundamental human rights, including her right against arbitrary detention, her right against inhuman and degrading treatment, and her right to a fair trial”.\nThey added that it was a matter of “extreme concern” that South Korean courts had turned down her repeated requests to be released during the trial, even after she collapsed during a hearing.\n“Our biggest fear is that she will have a complete breakdown, and that is why we are urging an intervention now so that she doesn’t get into the position where it becomes completely intolerable,” Dixon said.\nThe resignation of Park’s seven-member defence team means the trial cannot continue until replacement state lawyers have been appointed. The interruption could cause a long delay in the trial, since they will have to review more than 100,000 pages of evidence.\nHer lawyers said the decision to extend her detention was proof that the principle of the presumption of innocence was collapsing, according to Yonhap news agency.\n“As we’ve reached a conclusion that any defence argument for the defendant is meaningless, all of us decided to resign,” one of her lawyers, Yoo Yeong-ha, told the court.\nPark’s international lawyers claimed that her detention includes sleep deprivation, abusive and coercive interrogations, and excessively rough treatment that has left her with bruises from handcuffs.\n“It is internationally accepted that detention is the exception under international human rights standards, and is only justified in exceptional circumstances,” they said. “None of these pertain in the present case, which does not concern violent crimes.”\n"

        "text": "\nProsecutors in South Korea have demanded a 12-year prison sentence for the acting head of Samsung over his alleged role in a bribery and corruption scandal that toppled the country’s former president Park Geun-hye.\nSpeaking at the final hearing in his four-month trial at Seoul central district court on Monday, Lee Jae-yong fought back tears as he denied trying to seek political favours from Park in exchange for making large donations to foundations run by her close friend and confidante Choi Soon-sil.\nLee is officially Samsung’s vice-president but has in effect run the company since his father, Lee Kun-hee, had a heart attack in 2014. He was arrested in February on charges of bribery, embezzlement and perjury.\n\n\n\n\nSouth Korea spy agency admits trying to rig 2012 presidential election\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe billionaire scion of South Korea’s richest family told the court: “I have never asked anyone, including the president, for anything for the company or my personal gain.”\nAfter pausing and sipping water to regain his composure, he added: “I deeply regret that I have given such disappointment and apologise.”\nHe described his arrest and trial as “unjust” but added that he had the chance to reflect on his conduct during his six months in jail and accepted that the more Samsung had grown, “the stricter and higher the expectations from the public and society”.\nBut he added: “Whether it was for my personal profit or for myself, I have never asked the president for any favours.”\nProsecutors said Samsung’s alleged involvement in the Park scandal was indicative of the collusive ties between South Korea’s government and powerful, family-controlled conglomerates – or chaebol – of which Samsung is the largest.\nThe special prosecutor, Park Young-soo, accused Samsung executives of lying in their testimony to protect Lee, who faces the longest prison term for any South Korean executive if convicted.\nSamsung, whose group revenues are equivalent to almost a fifth of South Korea’s GDP, did not comment on the prosecutors’ demand. The court will deliver its verdict on 25 August.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Park Geun-hye outside court in Seoul on Monday. Photograph: Ahn Young-joon/AP\n\n\nProsecutors allege that Lee was the ultimate beneficiary of a range of crimes that involved four other Samsung executives, including Choi Gee-sung, the former head of its corporate strategy office, who faces 10 years in prison.\nLee allegedly offered $38m (£29m) in bribes to four entities controlled by Choi, to whom Park often turned for advice on policy, such as the security threat from North Korea.\nSamsung was the biggest single donor to the foundations, which Choi had set up to support Park’s policy initiatives. Samsung has not denied donating money to the organisations, but said it was coerced to do so by Park.\nThe company is also accused of separately giving Choi millions of euros to fund her daughter’s equestrian training in Germany. In return, Lee allegedly sought government approval for the contentious $8bn merger of two Samsung affiliates in 2015 – a move that would cement his control of the business empire.\nThe merger was opposed by many shareholders, but went through after the national pension fund – a major Samsung shareholder – approved it.\n“Even though Lee is the ultimate beneficiary, he has been pushing the blame on others [who have been] accused,” Park, the prosecutor, told the court.\nLee has insisted he played no part in decisions concerning the wider Samsung group and “mostly listened to other executives”. His lawyers said prosecutors had failed to provide any evidence of attempts by Lee to manipulate the succession process at Samsung.\nPark Geun-hye, who became South Korea’s first female president in 2012, is standing trial separately on a raft of charges including bribery, coercion and abuse of power following her dismissal from office in March.\nPark, who faces a possible life sentence, was formally impeached after public uproar over her questionable ties with Choi sparked months of mass protests.\n"

        "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2015/sep/18/what-exporters-need-know-about-dealing-with-bribery-corruption",
        "text": "\nImagine you are a small supplier to a £100m infrastructure project in Venezuela, say. The equipment you need is stuck in customs. The official at the Port Authority says he can expedite the paperwork you need. Only it will cost you. What do you do?\nThis is exactly the kind of scenario that engineering professionals will soon be able to access via a tailored online decision-making tool due to be rolled out by the Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE), which has 86,000 members worldwide. The Say No Toolkit also comes with a smartphone app that users can download and use in the field. \nThe solution comes as small businesses are becoming increasingly aware about the bribery and corruption issues that come with breaking into new markets overseas. Since the introduction of the UK Bribery Act in 2010, penalties associated with corrupt practices have become much stricter, with culprits potentially facing 10 years’ imprisonment and an unlimited fine. \nThe key section for businesses is Clause 7, which states that companies will be held liable if they fail to prevent “persons associated with them” from bribing another person on their behalf. \nAs well as their legal duty, companies have a moral obligation to reduce the risk of their staff being asked to “do something under the table”, says Philippa Foster Back, director of the Institute of Business Ethics (IBE), which co-developed the Say No Toolkit. \n“Should that happen, the risks for not only the employee but for you as a small business owner under the terms of the Bribery Act are extremely harsh. It’s not worth the risk,” she states. \nIn practice, it’s not always so easy to go against what may well be entrenched local business culture. Hence, the tool’s app function, which has a “Help Now” tab that guides users through what to do when faced with a bribe request or similar corrupt practice. \n“It’s something in your pocket that you can pull out and say, ‘I hear what you’re saying, but, sorry, I can’t do that. I will go to jail if I pay you this’,” says Foster Back. \nNathan Baker, director of engineering knowledge at the ICE, concurs. Although the engineering industry is “very alive” to corruption risks, he concedes that it’s not at the “forefront of SMEs’ minds”. “SMEs are time-poor and require the information when they need it and where they need it,” he says. Hence the value of the IBE tool. \nHis comments reflect a recent survey by the UK government, which finds that two-thirds (66%) of the SMEs surveyed are aware of the 2010 Act, but that three in five (59%) had not assessed the risk of being asked for a bribe. \nWhile it’s important to provide solutions to staff who are already in the field, the thrust of advice from experts is to have sound policies and procedures in place before any of your staff ever gets near a plane. \nThere is certainly no lack of documentation to bring SMEs up to speed on their legal obligations. The Ministry of Justice is possibly the best place to start. It offers a 45-page guidance report on the 2010 Act [PDF], as well as a shorter Quick Start guide [PDF].\nThese help clarify what is and isn’t covered by the law. Facilitation payments (defined as “payments to induce officials to perform routine functions they are otherwise obligated to perform”) are included, for example. Hospitality, on the other hand, is not.\nThe government’s guidance will also make SMEs aware of the “adequate measures” they are expected to take. Most are straightforward and not overly prescriptive. So an SME’s senior leadership, for example, must make clear its zero tolerance for corruption.\nOther steps include: undertaking a risk assessment of the bribery risks that you may face; doing thorough due diligence on agents, facilitators and others you may employ to act on your behalf in a foreign market; and communicating your policies on anti-bribery widely.\nAn abiding principle of the UK’s anti-bribery legislation is what the government’s guidance refers to as “proportionality”. Should an allegation arise, directors need to be able to show that the actions they took to prevent bribery were commensurate with the risks they faced and with the size of their business.\nThe proportionality principle has quietened initial concerns within the small business sector. Initially SMEs had feared that their liabilities under the 2010 Act would stretch to any corrupt act by someone acting on their behalf. This and other safeguards would have effectively made certain markets too risky to do business in, notes Adam Marshall, director of policy and external affairs at the British Chambers of Commerce.\n“The reason they got concerned wasn’t because they didn’t agree with measures to prevent bribery,” says Marshall. “It was the extent to which the onus fell on them to demonstrate that they’d done absolutely everything in their powers to prevent it.”\nEven if that onus isn’t as great as it was initially feared, small businesses shouldn’t skimp on assessing their risks prior to entering a new market, Marshall insists. Country rankings such as Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index provide a useful starting point. Specialist country risk consultancies such as Kroll and Control Risks can provide additional background checks if required.\nA cheaper and more direct method is to speak to business groups working in your target markets. The British Chambers of Commerce, for instance, now have accredited offices, from Mexico and Colombia to Thailand and Indonesia. “Either we have information about the markets in question or we have other companies that have done business there,” Marshall states.\nIt’s a message echoed by Chris Southworth, director of the UK arm of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC). Companies “can’t beat” getting practical advice from in-country experts, he argues. As well as ICC’s local offices, SMEs should consider approaching British business groups and the relevant British embassy. \nYet SMEs should be wary about losing perspective, he insists. For starters, the obligations on small companies are less onerous than for large ones. Secondly, plenty of tools and guidance now exist. Just this summer, for example, the ICC released detailed guidelines specifically for SMEs on mitigating corruption risks when working with third parties overseas. \nFinally, UK companies should see the country’s tough and well-publicised stance on combating corruption as a positive in the marketplace. Of course, refusing to pay a bribe may close the door to some business opportunities. It may also mean that your competitors steal a march on you. \nBut SMEs just need to “take that on the chin”, says Southworth. “Ultimately it’s about your reputation, your brand and your long-term growth and opportunity. And our advice would be, ‘Don’t do it’.”\nSign up to become a member of the Guardian Small Business Network here for more advice, insight and best practice direct to your inbox.\n"

        "text": "\nAllegations that British American Tobacco was involved in bribery and corruption in Africa are being investigated by the Serious Fraud Office, despite the cigarette company’s attempts to downplay the significance of a whistleblower who handed over a dossier of evidence.\nBAT, now the largest tobacco company in the world after the recent merger with Reynolds, has consistently denied the allegations of Paul Hopkins, whom it employed in Africa for 13 years. When Hopkins handed over a large number of documents to the SFO in December 2015, BAT dismissed him as “a rogue former employee”.\nThe company later toned down its criticism, stating that it had appointed a team of external legal advisers to investigate the charges.\nThe SFO’s inquiries have now become a formal investigation. In a statement it said it was “investigating suspicions of corruption in the conduct of business by BAT, its subsidiaries and associated persons”. It invited members of the public to come forward with any evidence they might have.\nThe news follows a major Guardian investigation revealing that BAT and other multinationals have used threats against at least eight African nations, demanding they axe or dilute the kind of tobacco control measures that have saved millions of lives in the west.\nBAT said it continued to conduct its own inquiries into Hopkins’ charges. “We have been cooperating with the Serious Fraud Office and British American Tobacco has been informed that the SFO has now opened a formal investigation. BAT intends to cooperate with that investigation,” it said.\nThe company would not confirm whether the investigation concerned the allegations made by Hopkins.\nHe has claimed he paid bribes on the company’s behalf to the Kenya Revenue Authority for access to information that BAT could use against its Kenyan competitor Mastermind. Hopkins also claimed that BAT Kenya had paid bribes to government officials in Burundi, Rwanda and Comoros to undermine tobacco control regulations.\nBAT hired the law firm Linklaters in February 2016 to conduct a “full investigation” into the claims made by Hopkins. BAT later dropped Linklaters and appointed Slaughter and May as sole adviser on the case.\nLouis Charalambous, Hopkins’ solicitor, said BAT had changed its tone. “We note, with interest, that BAT have abandoned their earlier PR strategy of trying to shoot the messenger,” he said in a statement.\n“Paul Hopkins blew the whistle during his time at BAT and their internal team ignored him. Previously BAT tried to wriggle out by saying that Mr Hopkins had left their employ in acrimonious circumstances when, in fact, that was untrue. They also wrongly suggested that he had acted on his own, and portrayed themselves as the victims.\n“Now their new external law firm and revised PR strategy are silent about Mr Hopkins. They need to go further and set the record straight. The company cannot rewrite this history, and we look forward to seeing them answer these allegations in due course.”\nHopkins said he had turned whistleblower at a cost to himself. “I rejected an enhanced redundancy package designed to force me to sign a global confidentially agreement and just took statutory redundancy instead,” he said.\nDeborah Arnott, the chief executive of the campaigning charity Ash, said: “At the time the allegations of fraud in Africa were first made against BAT the company accused the whistle blower of having a vendetta against the company and peddling falsehoods.\n“Eighteen months later and BAT is having to admit it’s under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office. The SFO must leave no stone unturned.”\nMatthew Myers, the president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, called on the US government to also investigate BAT. “The allegations against British American Tobacco are serious and should be investigated and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,” he said.\n“As British American Tobacco now operates the largest publicly traded tobacco company within the United States, we urge the US Department of Justice to also investigate the company’s alleged misconduct.”\nThe BAT chief executive, Nicandro Durante, told the Financial Times in March that the firm would “act in a very strong way” if wrongdoing was found to have taken place. He said: “We are in 200 countries, so I cannot give a 100% guarantee that everything’s going to go by the book.”\nThe SFO investigation is another blow to the company, after the US health watchdog, the Food and Drug Administration, announced tighter regulations on the tobacco industry, which hit shares in tobacco firms.\n\n"

However, the force has sought to retain the tapes as part of its inquiries.\nA source close to Allardyce told the Guardian that he believes he may have been coaxed into saying something that, in ordinary circumstances, he would not have said. \n“Basically,” said the source, “Sam just wants to know how he came to say what the paper reported.”\nThe Telegraph’s journalists had claimed to be businessmen working for a company that was seeking to recruit Allardyce as an ambassador who would attend speaking engagements in east Asia. Allardyce was accompanied at the meeting by his agent, Mark Curtis, and his financial adviser, Shane Moloney.\nIt took place as part of a broader 10-month Telegraph investigation into allegations of bribery and corruption in British football.\n\n\n\n\nThe sorry case of Sammy Lee, Sam Allardyce and FA double standards\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA City of London police spokesman said a production order was being sought in order to preclude the material being passed on to any third party, such as the FA and Allardyce.\nThe Telegraph said it would release the tapes to the FA when the police said it was free to do so. A spokesman for the newspaper said: “We will continue to cooperate with the police during their investigations. In the meantime, it remains our intention to release to the FA the relevant information of our investigation when we are free to do so.”\nIt means Allardyce, who is still facing an FA tribunal hearing into the affair, must wait for an unspecified period to have any chance of hearing the tapes. The FA is unlikely to pursue the matter without having had the opportunity to hear the tapes.\n"

        "text": "\nRolls-Royce has suffered the biggest loss in its history due to the cost of settling corruption charges and the impact of Brexit on the value of sterling.\nThe engine-maker reported a £4.6bn statutory pre-tax loss for 2016, one of the biggest corporate losses in British history.\nIt included a £4.4bn writedown on the value of financial hedges Rolls uses to protect itself against currency fluctuations and a £671m charge for the penalties the company has agreed to pay to settle bribery and corruption charges with the Serious Fraud Office (SFO), the US Department of Justice, and Brazilian authorities.\nThe biggest loss in British history is the £24bn recorded by Royal Bank of Scotland for 2008.\nWarren East, chief executive of Rolls-Royce, insisted the loss did not reflect the underlying health of the business. “This has no impact on what is really going on in the business and cash, it is just an accounting measure,” he said of the biggest loss for the company since Henry Royce established an electrical and mechanical business in 1884.\nAccounting rules mean Rolls was forced to write down the value of its currency hedges – which are worth more than £30bn – to reflect sterling’s slump. The pound has lost almost a fifth of its value against the dollar since Britain voted to leave the EU last June. Rolls hedges billions of pounds of cash to protect itself against currency fluctuations because deals in the aerospace industry are conducted in dollars.\nEast said he hoped the Brexit negotiations would result in “as close as possible to the status quo”. East and the Rolls management team backed the UK remaining in the EU in last June’s referendum. “Our main reason for being on the remain side was uncertainty. The very fact you are asking the question shows there is uncertainty,” he added.\nThe charge for settling the corruption allegations comes after Rolls agreed to pay £671m of penalties plus interest to the UK, US and Brazil.\nSir Brian Leveson, who approved the so-called deferred prosecution in court, said the SFO’s investigation into Rolls had revealed “the most serious breaches of the criminal law in the areas of bribery and corruption” and that some of the charges “implicated senior management and, on the face of it, controlling minds of the company”.\nHowever, the judge praised the cooperation of the firm’s existing management, which allowed Rolls to settle with the SFO rather than face a damaging trial.\nThe penalties related to charges that Rolls bribed middlemen around the world between 1989 and 2013 to win contracts.\nAlthough Rolls will make the payments over five years – with £293m expected to be paid in the first year – it has recognised the full cost in the latest accounts.\nThe SFO is continuing its investigation into individuals involved in the scandal and has said it will announce in the next few months whether or not it will bring charges.\nHowever, East, who has apologised for the “unacceptable” behaviour, said the settlement and the financial results allowed the company to draw a line under the scandal.\n“We are continuing to cooperate with the SFO with any inquiries they want to do, but as far as the SFO is concerned that is it – as far as the Department of Justice is concerned that is it,” he said.\nThe Rolls boss indicated he was hopeful that the damage to the company’s reputation would not lead to it losing lucrative contracts.\n“If you think about it in abstract, that is a risk,” he said. “But we have interacted with our customer base and generally there is an understanding that we are a very different business today.”\nExcluding the bribery penalties and the impact of currency fluctuations, Rolls reported that underlying revenues fell 2% in 2016 to £13.8bn and that underlying pre-tax profits fell 49% to £813m. This performance was ahead of forecasts in the City.\nNonetheless, Rolls said it would hold the final payment to shareholders at the same level as last year – 7.1p per share – given the company’s financial commitments and the investments it is making. Rolls cut its dividend last year for the first time in 24 years. \nOn the back of holding the dividend and a strong run for the share price in recent weeks, shares fell by 2.7% to 720.50p.\nEast said it has been an “important year” for Rolls and the management team has “accelerated the transformation of the business”.\nThe Rolls boss has been trying to overhaul and modernise the company since taking control in 2015, inheriting a business that is struggling for the first time in a decade. Rolls, which makes engines for Boeing’s 787 Dreamliners and Airbus’s A380 superjumbos among others, has been affected by lower-than expected demand for the wide-bodied airliners to which it supplies engines.\nIt has also been hurt by cuts to defence spending and the decline in the oil price, which has lowered demand from the offshore oil and gas industry for its marine products.\nIn response, East has focused on making Rolls more efficient and accelerating the pace at which it builds engines. He has cut hundreds of middle and senior managers and by the end of 2017 wants to have cut £200m of annual costs. At the same time, however, he has backed the quality of the technology that the company is developing and resisted pressure to sell off underperforming businesses.\n“I don’t have a concern about orders coming in through the door,” he said. “I have confidence in our technology.”\nHowever, East is reviewing Rolls operations and said that underperforming divisions could be sold off.\n“80% of our activities are in areas where we are competitive,” he said. “We are concerned with some of the areas where we are less competitive – can we change that and are we the best owner of those businesses. These tend to be in areas associated with older and more backward-looking technology. But you shouldn’t read into this that 20% of our business is up for sale.”\nSandy Morris, analyst at Jefferies, said: “The question is whether a corner has been turned. The turn may be slow in financial terms, but operationally and fundamentally it is faster, in our view.”\n"

        "text": "\nOfficials who led Tokyo’s successful bid to host the 2020 Olympics have been cleared of any illegal activity by a Japanese investigation, following revelations that the city had paid more than $2m to a company linked to the son of the disgraced former world athletics chief Lamine Diack.\nA report published on Thursday by an independent panel appointed by the Japanese Olympic Committee (JOC) said the $2.3m (£1.74m) payment to Black Tidings, a Singapore-based consultancy, was legitimate and had been made in return for consulting services.\n\n\n\n\nQuestions over Tokyo 2020 Olympic bid are spreading far and wide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“I believe that Tokyo has been cleared of any suspicion of bribery” in connection with its winning bid, said Yoshihisa Hayakawa, a lawyer who led the three-member panel.\nThe Guardian revealed in May that French authorities were investigating suspicious payments to Black Tidings, whose president, Ian Tan Tong Han, is a close friend of Papa Massata Diack. Diack’s father was an influential member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) when it awarded the 2020 Games to Tokyo in September 2013.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n \nBlack Tidings explained: the account at the heart of the IAAF scandal\n\n\nThe same Singapore-based account was also used to transfer funds in the attempted cover-up of a Russian doping case, according to the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada). Prosecutors in France are now conducting an investigation into whether the money led to the elder Diack.\nThe younger Diack, who is wanted in France on alleged bribery, money laundering and corruption charges – which he has denied – was employed by the IAAF, the world athletics governing body, as a marketing consultant, French prosecutors said.\nThe 50-page English version of the JOC report said there was no evidence that the consultancy arrangement between the Tokyo 2020 bid committee and Tan was “illegal or invalid under the civil laws or criminal laws of Japan, and there is no doubt that it is lawful”.\nThe report said there was no way any members of the Tokyo bid committee could have been aware that Tan and the Papa Massata Diack were friends. In fact, Tan and Diack have been close since they met at the Beijing Olympics in 2008, with Tan even naming his child, born in 2014, Massata, according to Wada’s investigation into the Russian doping scandal. \nHayakawa acknowledged that they had been unable to question Tan or either of the Diacks during their investigation.\n\n\n\n\nTokyo Olympic Games corruption claims bring scandal back to the IOC | Sean Ingle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“I am personally very disappointed that, despite initial indications by their lawyers that a meeting was possible, we were not able to interview the Diacks,” he said. “If we could have met Tan, especially, I’m sure we could have examined what exactly happened in this case. I am still holding out hope that we can speak to all three of them.”\nThe Japanese investigation was also unable to study official committee documents because they had been destroyed after Tokyo was chosen to host the 2020 Games.\nHayakawa, a second lawyer and an accountant had to rely mainly on documents that had been kept by former bid committee members and testimony during more than 30 hearings held between June and late August.\nThe report also concedes that the $2m-plus sum paid to Tan in two parts – an initial $950,000, with the remainder to be paid if Tokyo secured the Games – was double the average paid to other consultants the city had used during the bidding process. \nHayakawa said the bid committee had not received a precise accounting of how Tan spent the money. \nHe added that the bid committee had approached Tan at the urging of an executive at the Japanese marketing giant Dentsu, who pointed out that the consultant had been instrumental in securing Beijing the 2015 World Athletics Championships. Tan was fluent in English and Chinese, Hayakawa added, and possessed a detailed knowledge of the workings of the IOC, which at the time appeared to be leaning towards Istanbul as the venue for the 2020 Games.\n"

        "text": "\nAs the Olympic flame was lit before beginning its journey to Rio last year the IOC president, Thomas Bach, intoned: “The Olympic flame means hope to us all.” Mr Bach will likely be feeling hopeful now, with the news that the Rio home of Brazil’s Olympic committee chief has been raided, along with various other addresses, as part of a major investigation into international corruption and vote buying for the 2016 Olympic Games.\nBach will be hopeful that this is just a cosmic misunderstanding, hopeful that the £155,000 cash the police reportedly relieved Carlos Nuzman of was just one of those classic things everyone keeps in their cupboard, hopeful that the usual horse will ride to the rescue. (Which is to say, hopeful that Fifa – the IOC’s Swiss neighbours, and fellow candidates for an international ASBO – will do something even worse to distract attention.)\n\n\n\n\nRio Games vote-winner questioned by police over ‘rigged bidding process’\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs for the residents of the Rio favela who demanded water and sanitation and instead saw £22m spent on a cable car … they might be as sarcastically “hopeful” as they ever were. A year after the IOC blew out of town with billions in its coffers, Rio is effectively bankrupt, with public employees from hospital workers to teachers unpaid for weeks. Swings and roundabouts, isn’t it? The Olympic flame never goes out, but without federal handouts, the lights in Rio would.\nBut even back then, it should have been clear to Bach that residents of Rio didn’t feel remotely hopeful when a mega-event they could ill afford came to town. If he found the local reaction somehow opaque, for others the clues were fairly readable. The protesters. The stoning of the torch relay. The spectacle of half-empty Olympic venues appearing to fall into disrepair even during the fortnight of competition.\nInstead, he preferred not to look too hard. Selective blindness is in many ways his organisation’s default position – consider the IOC’s failure to ban Russia from Rio despite the discovery of what Wada’s former chief investigator called “the most outrageous doping and cover-up and corruption possible”. And on Tuesday, as news of the raids broke, the word from Lausanne was determinedly myopic again: “The IOC has learned about these circumstances from the media and is making every effort to get the full information. It is in the highest interests of the IOC to get clarification on this matter.”\nWhy are they always the last to know? Perhaps because the highest interests of the IOC are not in admitting how their tax-free money siphon works, but in ensuring it has new feeding grounds lined up. Details of various bribery and corruption investigations have been seeping out ever since the Rio Games. Mr Bach’s priority has seemed to be elsewhere: cutting a deal with Paris and LA, locking in the only cities remotely interested in hosting the 2024 and 2028 Games, and buying himself a bit of breathing space to work out how best to secure his parasitic event’s future in a world where you increasingly need to be stupid, corrupt or an ambitious autocracy to even have thoughts of hosting a Games.\nTuesday’s raids should at least prove sobering for the man who piously reacted to the Fifa scandal by declaring: “We hope that now, finally, everyone at Fifa has at last understood that they cannot continue to remain passive. They must act swiftly to regain credibility because you cannot forever dissociate the credibility of Fifa from the credibility of football.” Quite how much credibility Olympic sport has to lose is a matter of opinion – but Bach’s passivity is becoming ever more awkward to maintain.\nLewis Hamilton: poetry in motion\nGiven the always-precarious state of the journalism game, I was thrilled to discover that Lewis Hamilton writes about as well as I drive. I could easily envisage a professional future where we solve literary crimes together in a gullwinged supercar.\nFor some, alas, last week’s highest profile literary crime was Lewis’s poem to Princess Di, which he penned and posted to Instagram on the anniversary of her death. There was much to enjoy in this heartfelt opus, from Lewis’s assured couplets “Hearts still full of the love she gave/20 years since she laid in her grave” to the intriguing decision to tag in @vanmorrisonofficial. Arguably more enlightening was the section which ran “The people’s princess/Who came to see/The love from a Country /We’d hope she’d lead.” I confess I had no idea that Diana had ever been earmarked as a future leader of Britain – much less of Monaco – but if that was indeed the case, it puts a whole new light on things, even after all this time. And, indeed, all this light.\nEither way, you can’t knock the results of Lewis wearing his heart on his sleeve, next to other commercial sponsors such as Epson and Bose. Indeed, he specifically credits feeling more in touch with his heart with his recent surge of success. “I feel more heart and passion within myself,” he explained at the weekend. “I have found more in myself in the last three or four races. Silverstone was an empowering weekend and sparked a forest fire within me and hopefully that reflects in the way I am driving … While I feel like I always drive with my heart, and my heart is the power and force behind what I do, I think my mind is like the rudder and I feel it has been steering me in the right direction.”\nCan it really be a coincidence that Hamilton is hitting poetic form at the same time? I refuse to believe this is correlated and not causal.\nPerhaps there is something for Gareth Southgate to consider. As you will be more than aware, Southgate is leading England’s endless search for the precise combination of abstract nouns that will make them much better at football/more appealing than second‑half snifters in a Maltese bar. Heart, pride, identity … perhaps England could begin each international week with a poetry ritiro, where the entire squad is confined to a room until they have written a poem to lament or commemorate something vaguely topical. It doesn’t matter how bad it is – indeed, perhaps the worse the better. Really very bad poetry seems to go hand in hand with a performance uptick.\n"

        "text": "\nRolls-Royce, the engine maker hit by a £671m settlement of bribery and corruption charges, is to hold its first annual meeting for staff with the aim of improving communication with its global workforce of almost 50,000.\nThe annual meeting will be held in May in Derby, England, where the company has 14,000 staff. The board will take questions on a variety of topics after a year in which the fraud charges and sterling’s plunge drove the company to a loss of £4.6bn, the biggest in its history.\n Employee access to the boardroom at major companies has been on the agenda since Theresa May, the prime minister, raised the idea of putting workers on boards, although a green paper published last year stepped back from demanding this.\nRolls-Royce is not committing to appoint a worker to its board in the way that the transport group First Group has done. The embattled retailer Sports Direct last week said it would allow a worker representative to attend its board meetings but was accused by the union Unite of conducting little more than a “PR exercise”.\nRolls-Royce workers will have to apply for a place to attend the employee AGM, which seems likely to take place in the same venue as its shareholder meeting in Pride Park, home of Derby County football team. Those employees who own shares are already able to attend the shareholder AGM on 4 May.\nThe process is being overseen by the former HSBC banker Irene Dorner, who is a non-executive director at Rolls-Royce, and the logistics are yet to be finalised. It is not clear if staff outside the UK will attend and plans are being made to video the event.\nRolls-Royce revealed the employee AGM in its annual report published last week. Its chair, Ian Davis, said: “We note with interest the government’s green paper on UK corporate governance. The board is considering the level of interaction with stakeholders, particularly employees. We are planning to hold an ‘AGM for employees’ in 2017, and Irene Dorner will take the lead at looking at how we can strengthen our links between the boardroom and our employees.”\nWarren East, the Rolls-Royce chief executive who was paid £2m for 2016, has been a supporter of greater worker representation, using the example of its experience in Germany, where the company has 20% of its staff and where workers on boards are commonplace.\n\nThe TUC general secretary, Frances O’Grady, said: “We welcome companies looking at ways to improve employee engagement. Rather than simply strengthening links between workers and the boardroom, we need worker seats in the boardroom – as the prime minister promised.\n“It’s a tried, tested and successful approach in many other European countries. And it would improve the quality of decision-making in British boardrooms.”\n"

        "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/18/calls-for-ex-rolls-royce-ceo-to-lose-knighthood-after-firm-admits-bribery",
        "text": "\nLabour called for the former chief executive of Rolls-Royce to lose his knighthood, after the company admitted “extensive systemic bribery and corruption” during the period in which he ran the jet engines manufacturer.\nSir John Rose held the job at the Derby-based corporation, which was forced on Tuesday to admit that it was responsible for “egregious criminality over decades” between 1996 and 2011.\nBarry Gardiner, the shadow secretary of state for international trade, said Rose could not credibly retain his knighthood in light of the company’s conduct during his term as chief executive.\n“If Sir John Rose was the controlling mind in the company at the time, and was aware of these allegations, then he is not fit to hold his knighthood,” he said. “If in fact he was the chief executive of a company in which there was widespread corrupt practices going on, and he was unaware of that, then one has to ask whether he was fit to hold office as chief executive.”\n“Given that it is for services to the industry as chief executive that he was knighted, again it comes back to him not being fit to hold his knighthood. So I cannot see in either way that he can credibly retain his honour.”\nThe call came as Rolls-Royce also admitted in a deal with US prosecutors, that it had made corrupt payments worth more than $35m (£28.47m) in a further five countries between 2000 and 2013. The engineering giant had already apologised on Tuesday after UK prosecutors established that it had acted corruptly in seven countries.\nThe UK settlement was ratified in the high court in a deferred prosecution agreement, whereby the company would pay a fine but escape prosecution. \nAt the hearing, presiding judge Sir Brian Leveson said: “I am satisfied that both the senior management and those responsible for the strategic direction of Rolls-Royce are different to those responsible for the running of the company (and its culture) during the period when the events which I have described occurred.”\nLeveson also found that an internal report into overseas bribery and corruption had been compiled in 2010 but that the company decided not to report the illegal activity to the authorities.\nAs part of the global settlement process, Rolls-Royce stated that it had completely changed its senior management since uncovering the corruption.\nGardiner added that the regulators should ensure that all the individuals involved in corruption and bribery at Rolls-Royce should be held to account. The manufacturing multinational has been hit with the biggest criminal penalty in British history after being ordered to pay £671m in fines.\nOn Monday the company announced the settlement with the Serious Fraud Office (SFO), after accepting that its defence and civil aerospace divisions had paid bribes and corrupted officials and politicians around the world.\nRolls-Royce has insisted that no member of senior management was involved in the criminal activities, after a series of resignations. “The company we now look at in terms of its senior management is a different beast,” said SFO’s barrister Sir Edward Garnier told the high court on Tuesday.\n Rose declined to comment. Under Rose’s management Rolls-Royce’s profits rose more than fivefold, and he was widely praised as a captain of industry upon stepping down in 2011. Vince Cable, the then-business secretary, praised him as “a tremendous business leader”.\nOn Tuesday, details of the additional offences emerged after the US Department of Justice published its own deferred prosecution agreement with Rolls-Royce concerning its energy division. The UK settlement only covered bribery in the defence and civil aerospace sectors.\nThe DoJ said prosecutions of Rolls-Royce employees involved in corruption remained possible. A spokesperson said: “This remains an ongoing investigation, and a corporate resolution has no bearing on whether charges are brought against individuals.” \nThe SFO is still investigating the possibility of prosecuting individuals in the UK. In the US settlement, which did not name the middlemen used to pay bribes, Rolls-Royce admitted that:\n\nIn Thailand, its employees hired intermediaries to help it secure contracts with PTT, the state-owned energy company. In one instance an employee and senior executive discussed how a large payment would be disguised in the company’s accounting software. More than $11m of corrupt payments were made over 10 years.\nIn Brazil, Rolls-Royce hired an intermediary who bribed a senior official at the scandal-ridden state oil and gas company Petrobras. The intermediary was paid almost $10m, of which $1.6m was paid to a corrupt official. \nIn Kazakhstan, Rolls-Royce hired three different intermediaries knowing they would pay bribes to help the company secure contracts supplying components to a China-Kazakhstan gas pipeline that was under construction. Staff used personal email accounts and code names and deleted incriminating emails to hide the corruption.\nIn Azerbaijan, almost $8m in corrupt payments were made to an intermediary between 2000 and 2009, securing profits worth over $50m in contracts with the state-owned oil and gas company Socar.\nIn Iraq, an intermediary began bribing officials in Iraq’s state-owned Southern Oil Company in 2006 in exchange for confidential information, and later to stop Rolls-Royce being blacklisted after concerns were raised about turbines they had supplied.\nIn Angola, Rolls-Royce hired an intermediary despite knowing there was a high probability that bribes would be paid to foreign officials to secure contracts. $2.4m of corrupt commission payments helped the company secure almost $30m of profits between 2008 and 2012.\n\nFormer Royal Bank of Scotland boss Fred Goodwin lost his knighthood in 2012 after being heavily criticised over his role in the bank’s near-collapse in 2008. Before Goodwin was stripped of his knighthood, only convicted criminals or people struck off professional bodies had lost knighthoods. \nQuestions have also been raised about Sir Philip Green’s knighthood, after the collapse of the BHS chain of shops. \n• This article was amended on 19 January 2017. An earlier version gave a figure of £691m where £671m was meant.\n"

        "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/03/mckinsey-co-new-leader-management-consultancy",
        "text": "\nBehind the closed doors of five-star hotels and Michelin-starred restaurants, campaigning has begun in one of the world’s most secretive elections.\nCandidates are not allowed to officially campaign, are prevented from submitting a manifesto and nearly all of the voters earn at least $1m a year. Welcome to the race to become the next managing partner of McKinsey & Company, the world’s largest management consultancy firm which provides very expensive advice to multinational companies and governments across the world. \nWhile McKinsey advises its clients that transparency is “the most important driver” of improved performance, the consultancy firm refused to answer any questions about the process by which its partners are electing their new leader. The election, which informally began at the five-star Grosvenor House Hotel on Park Lane last month and will not conclude until the spring, is so secretive and archaic that its described it as similar to the conclave to elect a new Pope – bar the white smoke.\nWhoever wins will become one of the best-connected people in the world. Dominic Barton, the current managing partner, meets two chief executive or government leaders every day and is on a plane 240 days a year. His hectic schedule, he says, gives him “a unique perspective on what matters to companies, governments, and non-profits the world over”.\nThe new boss will also have to manage a lot of giant egos within the firm, which is owned by its partners and has been compared to the US marines, the Jesuits, the Roman army and a corporate Mandarin elite.\n“Our firm is full of leaders,” Barton, who known as Dom to his colleagues, said. “As managing director I set themes, make connections, and drive forward initiatives that will advance our ability to serve our clients, strengthen our firm, and develop our people.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Dominic Barton, the current global chief executive of McKinsey & Co. Photograph: Mint/Hindustan Times via Getty Images\n\n\nDuff McDonald, who describes the company as the “single greatest legitimiser of mass lay-offs … in modern history” in The Firm, his investigative book on McKinsey, said partners openly refer to themselves as “the greatest collection of talent the world has ever seen”.\nHe reports one partner stating that: “There are only three great institutions left in the world: the marines, the Catholic Church and McKinsey.”\nThe vote comes as McKinsey, which employs 29,000 people in 65 countries, is embroiled in the “state capture” controversy in South Africa. McKinsey is being investigated over allegations of bribery and corruption in relation to work it carried out for friends of the president, Jacob Zuma. It is the biggest crisis to hit the firm since former managing partner Rajat Gupta was jailed for insider dealing. \nMcKinsey denies the bribery allegations, but has admitted “violations of our professional standards” and apologised to the people of South Africa. Tom Barkin, its global chief risk officer, said the firm was “embarrassed” that work with a company linked to South Africa’s controversial billionaire Gupta family (no relation to Rajat Gupta) “fell short of our standards”.\nDespite the denial and apology, McKinsey was this week dropped by two of its biggest South African clients – Barclays Africa and Standard Bank – as public pressure mounts on all those involved in the scandal, which has already led to the collapse of public relations firm Bell Pottinger. \nAt a series of recent meetings and dinners arranged for partners to begin the selection to find a replacement for Barton, the South African scandal and its impact on the firm’s fiercely guarded reputation was the main topic of conversation. \nNone of the early rumoured frontrunners to replace Barton, who will have led McKinsey for the maximum permitted three three-year terms, are from the South African office or linked to the scandal. The runners and riders are said to include: Vivian Hunt, managing partner of the UK and Ireland; Gary Pinkus, managing partner for north America; Kevin Sneader, chairman of the Asia-Pacific; and Bob Sternfels, head of global functions.\nThe nomination process will formally begin in January when partners each select seven candidates in their preferred order. All of McKinsey’s senior partners can be selected bar those over age 57 or planning to retire. The results of the first round will narrow the field to 10. A second round of voting in February will whittle the field down to a face-off, with the winner announced in March and taking up the position in July 2018. It’s not known how much money the managing partner or any other partner gets paid as McKinsey does not publish any financial figures, but Gupta was reportedly paid $6m a year.\n“It really is the most unusual and secretive appointment process in the business,” said Matthew Gwyther, the recently departed editor of Management Today. “They keep the whole process very secret, it’s almost a papal conclave without the smoke coming up at the end. McKinsey is more secretive than that.\n“They’re secretive in everything they do, which from a journalistic point of view makes them maddening as they very rarely talk about anything. The most you get is the McKinsey Quarterly magazine.” The magazine is not exactly a page-turner: the lead story in the most recent edition is about how “a combination of survey data, sophisticated statistical analysis, and modelling” explains the importance of digitisation. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Vivian Hunt, managing partner of the UK and Ireland. Photograph: McKinsey & Company\n\n\nIn his column in the latest issue, Barton says companies need a “new playbook” on gender equality as companies fail to recruit enough women to high-level jobs. “The old [playbook] isn’t working,” he says. “We need bolder leadership and more exacting execution.”\nHis comments on gender equality, which include the admission that McKinsey itself is finding it hard to make “deep and lasting progress”, has focused attention on Hunt. She is the firm’s lead speaker on how increasing diversity can improve companies’ performance. Hunt, who is an African American with dual British and American citizenship, is serially published on the topic including reports titled Women Matter, Diversity Matters, and The power of Parity: How advancing women’s equality can add $12tn to global growth. \nHunt, who has been named one of the 10 most influential black people in Britain by the Powerlist Foundation, serves on the board of the CBI London council and the mayor of London’s business advisory board and advises the Tate Modern, the Southbank Centre and Teach First. \nGwyther said the fight for the top job is expected to be brutal as McKinsey’s partners “really are the crème de la crème of the business world, and my God do they believe in themselves”. He said they’re right to an extent. “They really do get the best students from the best universities and the best of the crop of the business schools.” \nThe firm receives nearly 100 applications for each place on its yearly intake. But securing a place does not mean a McKinsey career for life: the firm operates a brutal “up or out” policy with a turnover rate of about 25%. It is suggested that if recruits do not make partner within five or six years, they might want to try their luck elsewhere. Barton though is an exception, having failed to make the grade at his first two attempts at partner. \nOnce firmly in place, partners stay McKinsey-ites even after leaving the firm. Former partners – who populate boardrooms and parliaments across the world – are known to still refer to themselves and their former colleagues as “we”. The firm is often the first port of call for expensive advice when ex-McKinsey people get a new top job, including Mark Carney, who asked the firm to review the Bank’s operations shortly after he was appointed governor.\nOther alumni include Vittorio Colao, the chief executive of Vodafone; Sheryl Sandberg, chief operating officer at Facebook; Tidjane Thiam, the chief executive of Credit Suisse; Lord Green; Lord Turner; William Hague; and Chelsea Clinton. \nNot surprising then that Barton refers to the firm as a “leadership factory”. \n"

        "text": "\nThe Royal New Zealand Navy paid hundreds of thousands of dollars over four years to a ship services company run by a man now imprisoned in the US for an enormous corruption and sex scandal, the Guardian has learned.\nUS prosecutors say Leonard Glenn Francis, known as Fat Leonard for his wide girth, had cheated its navy out of nearly US $34m — mostly through overcharging port services and providing gifts to personnel, including arranging sex parties.\nThe New Zealand navy has told the Guardian it paid a total of NZ$710,235.04 (around £370,000) to Francis’ company, Glenn Defence Marine Asia (GDMA), between May 2007 to December 2011 “for specific ship visits in South East Asia.”\n\n\n\n\n'Fat Leonard': retired US admiral arrested in sex for secrets scandal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe navy told the Guardian in previous correspondence that it had used a “range of services” in Singapore from bus hire to tug provision.\nResponding to a freedom of information request, it added it had “not conducted an investigation into its relationship with GDMA based on the results of the US corruption investigation, nor is there an intention to do so.”\nThere has been “no standing or enduring contract” between the Royal New Zealand Navy and GDMA, which the navy said it had contracted in Singapore and Malaysia.\nA spokesperson on defence for the opposition Labour party in New Zealand, Iain Lees-Galloway, was quoted by local media demanding an investigation.\n“There was a significant amount of taxpayers’ money spent on contracts with this company,” he said, according to Radio NZ.\n“There’s clear evidence from overseas that this was a company that engaged in bribery and corruption, and the least that can be done in New Zealand is to take a look, just be certain that everything was above board.”\nBut at a Monday press conference the prime minister, Bill English, said “just because there’s allegations, doesn’t automatically mean something might have happened.”He said for an investigation to open, “There would need to be some evidence that navy officers had gone about their job of securing contracts in some way that was inappropriate or improper, I would imagine, but you are best to address that to the navy.”\nA three-year US case against Francis has severely and consistently rattled the US military. Rear Adm. Robert Gilbeau, the first US admiral ever convicted of a federal crime while on active duty, was sentenced on Wednesday to 18 months in prison for lying to investigators.\nFrancis, who was lured to the US and arrested in a 2013 sting, pleaded guilty in January 2015 and faces a maximum of two decades in prison.\nTwenty current and former Navy officials have been charged so far, while ten have pleaded guilty, mostly for bribes of lavish trips and sex workers in return for routing ships to ports where Francis could overcharge for ship husbandry services.\nOne US indictment said Francis once rented the MacArthur Suite at a hotel in the Philippines, where memorabilia of former American five-star General Douglas MacArthur was used for sex acts with prostitutes.\nGDMA’s website, now defunct, claimed the company had worked with more than two dozen navies around the world.\nThe UK navy did not hold any direct contracts with GDMA. Francis did, however, buy a decommissioned British Armed Forces ship, Sir Lancelot, which had been hit by an bomb that failed to explode during the Falklands war.\n\n\n\n\nAustralian customs contracted company linked to US navy ‘Fat Leonard’ scandal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ship, which Francis bought from a South African company, was renamed “Glenn Braveheart”, refurbished and reused occasionally as a giant party boat, with sex workers hired to entertain US officers, according to US court statements.\nThe defence department in Australia contracted one of Francis’ Singapore-based companies to provide port services for its vessels in Singapore on two occasions in 2008.\nAustralia’s border protection agency had also contracted Francis’ local company firm, Glenn Defence Marine (Australia), tender searches show.\nCanada’s navy told the Guardian in an email that although had not had any direct dealings with GDMA, it may have received minor support or docking services at various ports. \n"

        "text": "\nDonald Trump moved on Tuesday to expunge rules aimed at forcing oil companies to disclose payments made to foreign governments in order to secure lucrative mining and drilling rights.\nThe rules, called the Cardin-Lugar regulations, were established under the Dodd-Frank Act, the wide-ranging financial regulations brought in after the last financial crisis. Energy industry executives, including the former Exxon boss and now secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, have lobbied hard against the rule, arguing it gives global rivals a competitive edge.\n\n\n\n\nExxonMobil under investigation over lucrative Nigerian oil deal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rules aimed to help fight corruption, and critics charge that Tuesday’s move handed “an astonishing gift to the American oil lobby”.\n“It’s a big deal,” Trump said to reporters in the Oval Office as he signed the resolution. “The energy jobs are coming back. Lots of people going back to work now.”\nRepresentative Bill Huizenga, the repeal’s lead sponsor, said: “Over 20 years, there’s been 56,000 rules that have been put in place, with very little legislative input or oversight, and it’s time that changed.”\nThe repeal was made using the Congressional Review Act (CRA), which allows an incoming president to overturn new federal regulations. It is the first time the CRA has been used to repeal a regulation in 16 years. \nTrump’s move comes as oil company deals have come under intense scrutiny. Late last year, Russia sold a 19.5% stake in its giant oil company Rosneft, but the full identities of those who bought it are unknown.\nLast year, the Guardian revealed that Exxon, then led by Tillerson, was under investigation by Nigeria’s economic and financial crimes commission over lucrative oil rights it secured in 2009 by beating out China’s fourth-largest oil producer, despite apparently underbidding its rival bid by $2.25bn.\n“Trump has given an astonishing gift to the American oil lobby. Oil, gas and mining companies listed across the EU, including Russian companies, have already disclosed $150bn of payments in resource-rich countries, with no ill effects. This makes a mockery of claims by US oil companies such as Exxon that greater transparency would damage companies’ competitiveness. If the European companies can do it, you have to ask – what are US companies trying to hide?” said Zorka Milin, senior legal adviser at the advocacy group Global Witness.\nEric LeCompte, executive director of the religious development organization Jubilee USA, said: “In the short term, we lost a tool that can help track the billions of dollars lost to corruption and tax evasion in the developing world. Now we need to be sure that the new rule that the Securities and Exchange Commission writes will be a rule that can still stop corruption.”\nJubilee USA, which represents over 650 faith groups, fought for the passage of the Cardin-Luger rules in 2010 as a way of tackling bribery and corruption in developing countries that it argues exacerbate conflict and poverty. “Improving financial transparency and ending global poverty are two sides of the same coin,” said LeCompte.\n"

I thought I would offer it to my colleagues, but inside the tin were banknotes of various denominations,” Metta told Corriere della Sera. “Many banknotes in two different packages. I immediately called the police.”\nMetta said he had been supposed to have an appointment with the man’s business partner – a meeting which, presumably, is no longer in his diary. A former criminal lawyer, he called the businessman and berated him with a “series of insults”, ordering him to come back and take back the funds in an attempt to trap him. \nThe man, who has not been named, allegedly hung up. \nThe purpose of the bribe, according to reports, was a bid for a landfill in the Cerignola area. Waste management is known in Italy to be rife with mafia-linked corruption, as are public works contracts.\n\n\n\n\nItaly's Expo and other public projects hit by corruption claims\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocal police confirmed to the Guardian that Metta filed a legal complaint against the man.\nAsked whether he had perhaps made up the incident for attention, Metta denied the claim, saying the €20,000 had been placed “in custody”. While an act of such brazen bribery was almost unbelievable, Metta said, it was “an act of arrogance typical of people who think that money buy everything”.\n"

        "text": "\nBarclays boss Jes Staley has incurred the wrath of one of the bank’s most powerful clients, private equity giant KKR, after backing his brother-in-law in a legal dispute with the buyout house.\nKKR is no longer inviting Barclays to take part in potentially lucrative deals as a result and has not ruled out making a formal complaint to the bank’s board, sources familiar with the matter told the Guardian.\nAnd the US buyout firm issued a thinly-veiled warning reminding Barclays of its “responsibilities” to clients, in a row that threatens to expose Staley to renewed accusations of allowing personal relationships to affect the bank he runs.\n\n\n\n\nBarclays chief admits he 'made a mistake' over whistleblowing case\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe chief executive apologised last month after admitting that he asked Barclays’ internal security team to unmask a whistleblower, who had made accusations against an ex-colleague Staley recruited from his former employer JP Morgan.\nThe latest dispute, revealed in the Wall Street Journal, relates to Aceco, a Brazilian technology company founded by the family of Staley’s wife Debora Nitzan Staley.\nShe and her brother Jorge Nitzan sold their stakes in Aceco to KKR in a 2014 deal that valued the company at $700m (£542m) and is said to have made the siblings $240m between them.\nThe deal was KKR’s maiden direct investment in Brazil but went sour in 2015 when the private equity giant fired Nitzan, then Aceco’s chief executive, and wrote off its $475m investment, after an internal investigation into a whistleblower’s allegations of fraud.\nKKR said the probe uncovered evidence that Aceco made payments to people involved in Brazil’s gargantuan “Car Wash” bribery and corruption scandal, some linked to the 2014 World Cup.\nNitzan denied any involvement in fraud, saying KKR simply regretted an ill-fated investment made just before Brazil plunged into a deep recession.\nWhile Barclays was not part of any deals involving Aceco, Staley became involved in the row in a personal capacity after a company owned by Nitzan bought a tranche of Aceco debt.\nThe deal could have allowed Nitzan to regain control of the company he had sold to KKR, just a few years after the American private equity group had watched its investment dwindle to nothing.\nA legal dispute between Nitzan and KKR ensued and, according to reports, KKR asked Staley to listen to the findings of its investigation, in the hope he would convince Nitzan to settle.\nThe Barclays chief executive refused to do so and subsequently introduced a friend, Timothy Collins of New York firm Ripplewood Advisors, to Nitzan as a potential investor.\nKKR later learned that Staley had also discussed the Aceco affair with two of KKR’s co-investors in the company, the Texas Teacher Retirement System and Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund GIC, telling them he did not believe Nitzan would be involved in fraud.\nAlexander Navab, KKR’s private equity chief for the Americas, is understood to have called Staley to ask why he was aiding Nitzan despite serious allegations of fraud that affected KKR.\nStaley argued that he was acting in a personal capacity and would continue to defend his brother-in-law.\nBut KKR dismissed the idea that he was acting privately and has accused him of acting against the interests of a Barclays client.\nSources familiar with the matter said the conversations between Staley and Navab were “not friendly”. \nBarclays declined to comment.\nBut KKR issued a statement saying it had a “responsibility to protect the interests of our investors who we believe were defrauded in the sale of Aceco”.\n“We would also note that we have been a long-time client of Barclays, which comes with its own responsibilities for Barclays,” a spokesperson added.\nKKR, which has paid Barclays $190m in fees since 2010 according to Dealogic, is understood to have barred Barclays from taking part in certain deals and will continue to do so until the dispute is resolved.\nThe private equity group has also yet to rule out making a formal complaint about Staley to the Barclays board or its chairman John McFarlane.\nStaley is already facing a regulatory investigation, a pay cut and a potential investor revolt, after he admitted trying to unmask a whistleblower who made allegations about a long-term associate he had brought to the bank.\nThe American twice attempted to use Barclay’s internal security team to track down the authors of two anonymous letters, which he said were an effort to “maliciously smear” Barclays executive Tim Main.\nThe letters are understood to have contained allegations about the previous conduct of Main, who worked with Staley at US bank JP Morgan and was then recruited to Barclays in a senior role last June.\n"

        "text": "\nA vision of the near future: you’re in your driverless Apple vehicle, heading for the new-look Apple Store whose Genius Groves provide space for business meetings, while watching Apple’s exclusive Carpool Karaoke video series on your Apple TV.\nThe present is a bit more prosaic. On Tuesday, Apple’s current dependency on the iPhone is likely to be reinforced when it reports second-quarter results, hence its desire to expand its services businesses. The company is expected to report only a slight year-on-year rise in revenues to about $52bn after a couple of weak quarters, not to mention the first annual decline in iPhone sales last year. And analysts believe Apple’s guidance for the third quarter could be cautious, with JP Morgan forecasting sales of $44.2bn for the three months to June.\nThe problem is that consumers could be keeping their cash in their pockets until the next iPhone arrives (it’s expected in September). Although some reports suggest the new model could be on display at the Worldwide Developers Conference in June, there have also been suggestions the September launch may be delayed because of supposed problems with a new edge-to-edge screen.\nBut despite chief executive Tim Cook being unhappy at some of Donald Trump’s actions, notably the recent travel ban, Apple is set to benefit from the president’s tax policies. Trump plans to give incentives to companies who repatriate their large overseas cash holdings, although no details were given at last week’s tax announcement.\nA £2.6bn loss? Here, have a £343,000 bonus\nPearson has come a long way since it began selling off its crown jewels, including Madame Tussauds, investment bank Lazard and more recently the Financial Times and the Economist, with its stake in book publisher Penguin Random House the next on the block.\nUnfortunately it has been in the wrong direction, with the company’s concentration on educational publishing proving problematic, particularly in the key US market. It reported the biggest loss in its history last year – some £2.6bn. Still, that didn’t stop Pearson awarding chief executive John Fallon – who has presided over five profit warnings since taking over from Marjorie Scardino in 2013 – a 20% increase in his total pay to £1.5m. To the surprise of many, this included a bonus of £343,000.\nWhen the award was announced last month, Sarah Wilson, chief executive of investor advisory service Manifest, said: “Many shareholders are automatically voting against any increased awards and so this will just ratchet up tension.”\nSomething for Pearson investors to consider as they make their way to the company’s annual meeting on Friday.\nRolls promises to create more bread\nAnother company which recently recorded the biggest loss in its corporate history, and which is also holding an annual meeting this week, is Rolls-Royce.\nThe aero-engine maker agreed a £671m settlement in January relating to bribery and corruption charges and this, along with a £4.4bn writedown due to the plunge in sterling, helped push it into a £4.6bn loss for the year. Chief executive Warren East said the write-off was “just an accounting measure” and did not reflect the underlying health of the business.\nThe company has a target of increasing free cash flow from the current £100m to £1bn by 2020, which some analysts are unconvinced will happen. Deutsche Bank said: “Although we believe much better cash generation lies ahead … achieving the magic £1bn targeted by management looks to be a stretch too far. The key challenge for management is materially improving the cash generation within large civil engines.”\nInvestors will have the chance to quiz executives on this and other topics at Thursday’s meeting, which takes place at Pride Park, home of Derby County football club. They must hope that, unlike Derby this time around, Rolls will soon be considered a Premier League performer again.\n"

        "text": "\nA payment made by Sergey Bubka, the senior vice-president of athletics’ world governing body, to a now disgraced senior figure is to be investigated by the independent Athletics Integrity Unit, the Guardian can reveal.\nBubka, who is also an executive board member of the International Olympic Committee and an Olympic gold medallist, was reported by the French newspaper Le Monde to have paid $45,000 into the Monaco account of the Nevis-registered firm of Valentin Balakhnichev, the former IAAF treasurer and head of Russian athletics, on 18 June 2009.\nA day earlier, Balakhnichev’s account, New Mills Investment Ltd, transferred almost precisely the same amount ($45,033.12) to Pamodzi Sports, the consultancy arm of Papa Massata Diack, the former IAAF marketing executive.\n\n\n\n\n‘The biggest lie in the history of world sport’: Diack dismisses corruption allegations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe documents, which have been seen by the Guardian, show that the payments were made on two days in 2009. However, there is nothing to suggest that Bubka was aware of how his payment may have been used, or that a sum equivalent to it may have been passed on, or where that sum was passed on to.\nIn a statement Brett Clothier, head of the Athletics Integrity Unit, said that it would be looking into the payment. “The Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) is aware of the article published today in Le Monde in which allegations are made concerning International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) senior vice-president, Sergey Bubka,” he said.\n“The AIU is the fully independent body that was established by the IAAF on 3 April 2017 to address all integrity-related matters in international athletics, with a remit that includes investigating allegations of misconduct involving IAAF officials. The unit will seek further information in relation to this matter in accordance with its functions under the rules.\n“In order to protect the integrity of its ongoing work and cases, the AIU will be making no further comment at this time.”\nThe unit was set up in April to beef up athletics’ anti-doping powers and to “address integrity breaches in other areas of concern such as bribery and corruption, betting … in short combatting any and all threats to the integrity of the sport”.\nBubka, who broke the world record 35 times in a glittering pole vault career before becoming a sports administrator, has strenuously denied any wrongdoing. A statement from the Ukrainian’s lawyers, Simons Muirhead & Burton, said: “My client has no knowledge of or involvement in any alleged business dealings between Mr Balakhnichev and other parties, including Mr Diack. Similarly my client has no financial relations with Mr Diack. And the answer is no to any relationships with any bidding cities.”\nOn being presented with evidence of the payment to Balakhnichev, a spokesman for Bubka said: “It was for consultancy services performed by Mr Balaknichev solely in connection with and to expand the reach of the annual Pole Vault Stars tournament which Mr Bubka used to organise each year in the Ukraine until 2014.”\nPole Vault Stars was an annual competition in Donetsk, Ukraine, that began in 1990 and continued until 2014 when it was put on hold due to the annexation of Crimea.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Valentin Balakhnichev dismissed the claims about his payment as ‘fake news … your western system bring to you this problem’. Photograph: Joseph Okanga/Reuters\n\n\nAsked specifically about the transfer from Bubka to his New Mills company, Balakhnichev also said it was linked to a plan to expand Pole Vault Stars. “As I remember, we [were] planning to create a new event in Russia, especially in Moscow and some cities in the world, with his Pole Vaulting Stars as a series competition with [the] finish in Donetsk,” he said. Ultimately, no plans to expand the event were ever put into the public domain.\nBubka and Balakhnichev were close colleagues at the IAAF having developed a long-standing friendship when the Ukrainian was a star pole-vaulter. In an interview published on allsportinfo.ru in August 2007, before allegations of corruption and cover ups emerged, Bubka said of Balakhnichev: “We have been friends for a long time. And even, moreover, we hold the same views in life. Valentin is a high level professional and extraordinary person. He has always had lots of interesting projects, original and sometimes revolutionary ideas.”\nBalakhnichev had a life ban for corruption upheld by the court of arbitration for sport in August. Diack is on the run from Interpol after being linked to corruption and vote-buying during Rio’s bid for the 2016 Olympics.\nDiack remains defiant\nDiack did not respond directly when asked to explain what the money from New Mills Investment was used for. The payment was received by him when the candidate cities for the 2016 Olympics presented the technical aspects of their bids at a two-day briefing for IOC members. The bid was eventually won by Rio when the vote took place in Copenhagen in October 2009.\nHowever Diack, who has also been on the run from French financial prosecutors investigating allegations of “corruption and money laundering” involving millions of dollars from the Rio 2016 and Tokyo 2020 Olympic bids, made it clear that he felt he was being subjected to unjustified attention from the investigator Renaud van Ruymbeke.\nIn an email he wrote: “Please tell Renaud van Ruymbeke and his team of investigators that their inquiry will never be done via press articles, press releases and spectacular press conferences. He has to get ‘balls and brain’ and the courage to fly over to Dakar [five hours from Paris] to get formal written and official answers.” The Guardian understands that the French prosecutors have not been allowed by the Senegalese authorities to go to Dakar to question Diack, who added in his email: “Good luck for your articles. At least you’re confirming be the existence of your Caucus Group!!”\n\n\n\n\nCas upholds life bans for Papa Massata Diack and Valentin Balakhnichev\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiack also denies any corruption, recently telling Reuters the allegations were “the biggest lie in the history of world sport”.\nHowever transactions seen by the Guardian suggest that there were a number of financial dealings between Diack and Balakhnichev while they were both senior figures in the IAAF. Not only did Balakhnichev sign an agreement with Pamodzi Sports Consultancy on 12 February 2012 for $995,000 but there were a number of large payments to and from the Russian and Diack, the biggest of which was a $2,182,000 transfer in February 2012.\nBalakhnichev also refused to answer a number of questions about the transactions but in an email called them “fake news” and claimed “your western system bring to you this problem”.\nHe added: “Not me, not mentioned people, not private information mentioned in your letter is not right and have any communication with the 2016 bids. It’s really new fake. I don’t think that you information have this rights to be published, and your combination of information can only be a your private opinion. Don’t forget to mention about it.”\nBoth Balakhnichev and Diack were banned for life from athletics last year for their part in inflicting “unprecedented damage” on the sport following a 20-month investigation into corruption, blackmail and extortion involving the Russian marathon runner Liliya Shobukhova, who made secret payments to avoid being banned for doping offences.\nShe was asked to pay €450,000 in three tranches to the Black Tidings account linked to Papa Massata Diack in order to guarantee her participation in the 2012 Olympics Games, which she saw as the pinnacle of her athletics career. Shobukhova ran in London and subsequently in the Chicago marathon because the management of her blood passport case had been slowed down.\n"

        "text": "\nBusiness executives implicated in a Brazilian corruption scandal and relatives of an Angolan politician who has been accused of bribery have secretly bought access to Europe via the government of Portugal.\nA businessman sentenced to 18 years under house arrest and the former president of a scandal-ridden construction conglomerate are also among those named in a leaked document as having paid hundreds of thousands of euros in their pursuit of a “golden visa” in Portugal.\n\n\n\n\nCyprus 'selling' EU citizenship to super rich of Russia and Ukraine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe news follows another leak that showed Russian oligarchs and a Syrian businessman under US sanctions were among hundreds of investors granted citizenship from Cyprus in exchange for cash investment.\nThe two leaks offer a detailed insight into golden visa schemes, whereby countries trade passports, citizenship or visas for investment from wealthy individuals. \nPortugal’s “golden resident permit” programme requires investors to place €500,000 (£440,000) in property in exchange for permanent residency. After five years, residency can be converted to citizenship, granting investors the right to live and work throughout Europe under EU rules.\nAccording to the government, 66% of the “golden visas” issued since 2012 have been to Chinese applicants, despite it being illegal in China to transfer more than $50,000 out of the country in a single year. \nFor more than two years, Brazil has been racked with scandal resulting from Operation Car Wash, a judicial investigation into a vast network of bribery and corruption permeating the highest levels of public life.\nThe investigation centres on billions of dollars of corrupt contracts involving the state oil company Petrobras. Hundreds of politicians and businesspeople have been investigated and dozens have been convicted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Otávio Azevedo. Photograph: Rodolfo Buhrer/Reuters\n\n\nOne of them is Otávio Azevedo, the former president of the country’s second-largest construction company, Andrade Gutierrez. He received an 18-year sentence last year after admitting a string of corruption offences.\nTwo years before his arrest, Azevedo bought a €1.4m property in Lisbon and subsequently applied for a golden visa in 2014.\nA spokesperson for Azevedo said he was yet to be informed as to whether his application had been accepted. They said he had acquired the property in full compliance with Portuguese law and that a plea deal he had signed with Brazilian prosecutors had helped to uncover “numerous” other instances of corruption.\nSérgio Lins Andrade, the chairman and main shareholder of Andrade Gutierrez, acquired a Lisbon property through the golden visa scheme in 2014 for €665,000. He is estimated by Forbes to be worth $1.5bn (£1.1bn).\nA spokesperson for Andrade, who earlier this year was summoned to give evidence to the corruption investigation, did not dispute that he had acquired Portuguese residency, but said he did not live in Portugal and had no plans to do so.\nPedro Novis, the former president and CEO of Odebrecht, South America’s largest construction firm, bought a €1.7m Lisbon property in 2013, which he had first agreed to acquire in 2009. This purchase was the basis for his golden visa application made in late 2013. The company has been accused of multiple corruption offences across Latin America.\nA spokesman for Novis said: “He has nothing to declare and the information concerning his activities in Portugal is known by the Brazilian courts.”\n\n\n\n\nThe billionaires investing in Cyprus in exchange for EU passports\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOthers named in the document are relatives of the Angolan vice-president, Manuel Vicente, who until 2012 was the chief executive of the country’s state energy firm, Sonangol.\nVicente, once tipped to be the next Angolan president, this year faced allegations that he tried to bribe a Portuguese magistrate in order to suppress an investigation into corruption at Sonangol.\nA lawyer for Vicente said he had no comment other than to deny the allegations of the Portuguese authorities.\nOther recipients of golden visas named in the leaked document include:\n\nCarlos Pires Oliveira Dias, the vice-president of the Camargo Correa construction group, invested €1.5m in Portugal under the golden resident programme in 2014. Camargo Correa has also been linked to the Car Wash scandal, reportedly repaying 700m reais (£168m) to state companies in compensation for corrupt practices. The company was reported to be seeking a plea deal this year. Oliveira Dias confirmed that he had obtained a golden visa.\nJosé Mauricio Caldeira sits on the board of the holding company behind Asperbras, a Brazilian conglomerate with interests in sectors from geology to agribusiness. A police investigation, Operation Atlantic Route, is examining the firm’s relationship with José Veiga, a businessman arrested last year on suspicion of corruption offences. A spokesperson for Caldeira confirmed that he acquired a Portuguese apartment in 2014 for €1m under the country’s golden visa programme and had since taken up residence there. They said both he and shareholders of Asperbras were cooperating fully with investigators.\nJoão Manuel Inglês is an Angolan colonel and aide to Gen Manuel Helder Vieira Dias, better known as Kopelipa, head of the Angolan military and one of the most powerful figures in Angola. Inglês, who was accused in a US class action lawsuit of being a “figurehead” for Kopelipa and two other Angolan ruling figures, applied for a Portuguese golden visa in 2013. He did not respond to requests for comment.\nPedro Sebastião Teta, the Angolan secretary of state for IT, applied for a golden visa in 2013. The following year he was reported to own 30% of a company called Impulso Angola, which was awarded a contract by the government to map the country’s mineral resources. He did not respond to requests for comment. \nSebastião Gaspar Martins, the executive director of Sonangol’s Brazilian arm, sought a Portuguese golden visa in 2014. He has been cited as a possible successor to Vicente as vice-president. Martins declined to comment on the golden visa.\nAnother applicant was Mir Jamal Pashayev, the head of one of Azerbaijan’s most powerful families and the director of Pasha Holding. Pashayev’s niece is Mehriban Aliyeva, the wife of the Azerbaijani president, Ilham Aliyev. Neither Pashayev nor Pasha Holding responded to repeated requests for comment.\n\nThat individuals implicated in corruption have secured golden visas through property purchases will raise particular concern among financial crime experts. Real estate has long been attractive to criminals due to the potential to launder large quantities of cash in a single transaction.\nPortugal’s golden visa scheme has previously been at the centre of scandal. In 2014 police arrested 11 people as part of Operation Labyrinth, an investigation into allegations that foreigners had been issued with golden visas in exchange for bribes.\nThe head of the border agency and the president of the Institute of Registries and Notaries were among those detained and the scheme was briefly closed down. A former minister of the interior was subsequently designated a suspect in the investigation. He denies wrongdoing.\nIn a statement, the government of Portugal said its golden visa scheme “strictly follows all legally established security procedures” and that authorities had “adequate tools which safeguard lawfulness and security”.\n“All applications are subject to review following an evaluation process, by means of criminal records and consultation of national and international databases, as well as the exchange of information in the framework of police cooperation,” it said.\n Additional reporting by Stelios Orphanides.\nThis article was developed with the support of the Journalism Fund.\n• This article was amended on 12 October 2017 to clarify and add details about Pedro Novis’ property purchase and visa application, based on information provided by Novis after publication.\n"

        "text": "\nThe Serious Fraud Office and Tesco are within days of announcing a settlement that could mean Britain’s biggest supermarket chain will pay a multimillion-pound fine over an accounting scandal.\nUnder the deferred prosecution agreement (DPA), Tesco would pay a penalty that could be well over £100m and agree to other conditions in return for avoiding formal prosecution for overstating its profits.\nThe SFO is also close to making a decision on whether to formally charge Barclays and former senior executives at the bank over a £7.3bn bailout from the Middle East at the height of the financial crisis.\nDavid Green, director of the SFO, had said he was aiming to make a decision about the Barclays case before the end of March but it is understood this could now slip into April or even later. The investigation into Barclays centres on whether £2bn that the bank lent to Qatar was used in the 2008 fundraising.\nThe SFO and Tesco could announce they have reached a DPA as early as this week, according to people close to the talks, although the exact timing depends on if or when the high court approves the deal. The advanced talks between SFO and Tesco and the potential financial penalty of more than £100m were first reported by Sky News.\n\n\n\n\nTwo Tesco shareholders oppose £3.7bn takeover of wholesaler Booker\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Tesco and Barclays investigations are two of the most high-profile cases ever to face the SFO. The fraud-busting agency has been heavily criticised by politicians in the past for the cost of failed investigations but it recorded a significant victory earlier this year when Rolls-Royce agreed to pay £671m to settle allegations that it bribed middlemen around the world between 1989 and 2013.\nThe Rolls deal was the first major DPA struck by the SFO. DPAs, which were introduced in the UK in 2014, allow a company to suspend a prosecution in return for meeting specified conditions, such as paying a fine and demonstrating that their culture has changed. DPAs, which have been used in the US for years, require judicial approval.\nRolls-Royce qualified for a DPA because the executives in charge of the aerospace and defence company during the period under scrutiny had all left and the company co-operated with the SFO’s investigation.\nTesco also meets this criteria. The SFO launched a criminal investigation into accounting practices at Tesco in October 2014 after the company admitted it had overstated profits by £263m by incorrectly booking payments from suppliers. It later revised this overstatement to £326m.\nTesco, Britain’s biggest retailer by sales, announced the black hole in its profits after a whistleblower approached Dave Lewis, the new chief executive, after he joined the business in September 2014. The shortfall in the grocer’s profits related to the period before Lewis’s arrival, when Tesco was run by Philip Clarke.\nThree former Tesco executives accused of fraud in relation to the accounting scandal will go on trial in September. Christopher Bush, the former managing director of Tesco UK; Carl Rogberg, the former finance director of Tesco UK; and John Scouler, the former commercial director for food, are all charged with one count of fraud by abuse of position and one count of false accounting. They are due to go on trial in London on 4 September and have indicated that they will plead not guilty.\nClarke, who ran Tesco from 2011 to 2014, has not been charged. He was interviewed under caution as part of the SFO’s investigation but has since been told that he would not face further action.\nOn top of the Tesco and Barclays cases, the SFO is still investigating the pharmaceutical firm GlaxoSmithKline, the planemaker Airbus and other major companies. It is also considering whether to charge individuals in the Rolls-Royce case. The organisation said in January, when it announced the DPA with Rolls-Royce, that its investigation into individuals was continuing and it could bring charges within months.\nIn the judgment in the high court on the DPA between the SFO and Rolls-Royce, Sir Brian Leveson said the company had conducted “the most serious breaches of the criminal law in the areas of bribery and corruption” and that some of the allegations “implicated senior management and, on the face of it, controlling minds of the company”.\nTesco, Barclays and the SFO declined to comment.\n"

        "text": "\nUntil a few months ago, Lee Jae-yong was well on the way to securing his status as South Korea’s most powerful business leader.\nBut on Friday, the heir to the Samsung empire could be starting a lengthy prison sentence for his alleged role in a bribery and corruption scandal that has already triggered the impeachment of the country’s former president, Park Geun-hye.\nLee, AKA Jay Y Lee and Samsung’s vice-chairman and de facto head, has denied trying to seek political favours from Park in exchange for making large donations to foundations run by her close friend and confidante, Choi Soon-sil.\n\n\n\n\nSouth Korea prosecutors demand 12-year sentence for Samsung boss\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe billionaire’s fate rests in the hands of the Seoul central district court, where a panel of judges will deliver a verdict on charges ranging from bribery to embezzlement and perjury.\nThe 49-year-old, who took over the reins at Samsung after his 75-year-old father, Samsung chairman Lee Kun-hee, suffered a debilitating heart attack in 2014, faces up to 12 years in prison.\nMore than 450 people applied for just 30 seats in the public gallery to witness what has been billed as the “trial of the century”. Millions of other South Koreans outside the courtroom will be glued to coverage of the first major legal battle prompted by a scandal that has rocked the country’s political and business worlds.\nSamsung’s alleged involvement in the Park scandal has highlighted the collusive ties between politicians and powerful, family-controlled conglomerates – or chaebol – and called into question the foundations on which South Korea built its postwar economic success.\nPublic anger over Park’s conduct while in office has heightened pressure on the court to convict Lee. While he has denied that he paid bribes to further his career at a company founded by his grandfather Lee Byung-chul in 1938, Samsung executives have been accused of lying in their testimony to protect the younger Lee, who faces the longest prison term for any South Korean executive if convicted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Park Geun-hye, the former South Korean president, is being tried separately for corruption. Photograph: Ahn Young-joon/AP\n\n\nLee allegedly offered $38m (£30m) in bribes to four entities controlled by Choi, to whom Park often turned for advice on policy, including Seoul’s strategy for dealing with the threat from North Korean missiles.\nSamsung was the biggest single donor to the foundations which Choi had set up to support Park’s policy initiatives. Samsung has not denied donating money to the organisations, but said it was coerced to do so by Park; Lee claims the payments were approved without his knowledge.\n The company is also accused of separately giving Choi millions of euros to fund her daughter’s equestrian training in Germany. In return, Lee allegedly sought government approval for the contentious $8bn merger of two Samsung affiliates in 2015 – a move that would cement his control of the Samsung group.\nThe merger was opposed by many shareholders, but went through after the national pension fund – a major Samsung shareholder – approved it.\nA guilty verdict would represent a remarkable fall from grace for Lee, who is estimated to be worth $7.9bn, making him the third wealthiest person in South Korea.\nHis father’s ill health propelled him to the top of a huge business empire whose consumer electronics arm alone accounts for a fifth of all South Korea’s exports.\nOnce regarded as the heir apparent to the corporate giant built on mobile phones and TVs, but whose other interests, including hotels, shipbuilding, insurance and construction, reach into every area of the South Korean economy, he now faces a future simply as prisoner Lee.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Police officers flank Choi Soon-sil, the woman at the centre of the South Korean political scandal and long-time friend of Park Geun-hye. Photograph: Kim Hong-Ji/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\nIf the court convicts – and his sentence is upheld on appeal, probably next year – the scion of South Korea’s richest family could serve his sentence at a crowded prison nestling in the hills north of Seoul.\nWhile he wouldn’t be the first business leader to have served his time at Uijeongbu prison, Lee’s wealth and status would count for little.\nHe would probably be held in a single cell equipped with basics such as a TV and electric fan. Like other prisoners, he would be expected to carry out mundane work, and would be allowed outdoors for just one hour’s exercise a day. He would also be permitted to study English or Japanese and attend religious services. \nMeanwhile, the family firm he was on the cusp of leading faces a period of unprecedented upheaval. Two days before he was sentenced, Samsung tried to project an air of normality with the launch of its latest smartphone – the Galaxy Note 8 – an attempt to banish memories of the disaster that befell its predecessor, the Galaxy Note 7.\n\n\n\n\nSamsung's 'exploding' Note 7 repackaged as Galaxy Note Fan Edition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Samsung’s denials that Lee made the payments in the expectation of political favours have left the firm ill-prepared for his possible imprisonment.\nAlthough he is expected to appeal against a guilty verdict, his colleagues have reportedly not lined up an executive capable of making key decisions that were once made by Lee.\n“There’s no one right now who’ll decide on group-wide issues,” an anonymous Samsung source told Reuters. “It’s not impossible to imagine a scenario where a Samsung affiliate gets into trouble and other units become entangled.”\nReports said Samsung has not even set up an internal body to plan for a possible leadership vacuum, and has no plans to resurrect its corporate strategy office – known as the “control tower” – which was disbanded in February amid criticism of its role in the scandal.\n“I think Samsung faces major challenges in efficiently managing the entire group … it will struggle for a while to re-establish a strategic decision-making process,” said Kim Sang-jo, South Korea’s new antitrust chief.\nSamsung said in a statement: “The corporate strategy office’s role was to support affiliates and coordinate with them, including mediating overlapping businesses and (their) different interests, but the final business decision was made by each company.”\nFriday’s is the first in a string of court rulings that will bring closure of sorts to the Park scandal, but could leave its most powerful company effectively rudderless. \nA verdict in the trial of the former president, who faces a possible life sentence, is expected in October.\nReuters contributed to this report.\n"

        "text": "\nUPDATE. September 2017: lawyers for Sam Allardyce have contacted us to say that he disputes the allegation that he gave advice on how to circumvent the FA’s rules on third party ownership. \nThe Sam Allardyce story puts the journalistic use of subterfuge under the spotlight once more. Was the Daily Telegraph right to launch what amounts to a sting operation to expose the England football manager?\nMy unhesitating answer, based on my reading of the newspaper’s articles (and not on any extra inside knowledge) is yes.\nThere is a clear public interest justification in knowing that a man employed by the Football Association is offering advice on how to circumvent its rules.\nI cannot see how the Telegraph could have obtained the story any other way, so it is compliant with the editors’ code of practice (as overseen by the Independent Press Standards Organisation (Ipso).\nNor can this have been said to be a “fishing expedition”. The newspaper obviously had prima facie evidence before its reporters took the trouble to masquerade as businessmen from a fictitious Far East firm. \nAccording to the Telegraph’s account, it had been conducting a 10-month investigation into alleged cases of bribery and corruption in British football.\nIt said it began its inquiries “after receiving information that specific managers, officials and agents were giving or receiving cash payments to secure player transfers.”\nAnd it has promised to “detail a series of allegations of financial impropriety... which raise serious questions about the governance and influence of money within the game.”\nAllardyce is the FA’s main employee and the recipient of a £3m-a-year salary (plus bonuses) in a job with a unique national profile. In such circumstances, the paper’s undercover operation is wholly defensible.\nIt was also significant that Allardyce’s agent, Mark Curtis, and his financial adviser, Shane Moloney, were present at a meeting with two Telegraph meetings, which was covertly filmed and recorded.\nThis was not one of those cases in which a single, naive person was entrapped or taken advantage of. Three adults were involved in the encounter.\nUnless anything untoward, and as yet unknown, about the nature of the subterfuge emerges, then it amounts to a worthwhile piece of investigative journalism. \n"

Now the Financial Times has reported (£) that the probe has now been extended to look at Rolls’ former energy operations in Nigeria. The report said the SFO was investigating whether Rolls or its agents were involved in any bribery of government officials in Nigeria up to 2013.\nThe SFO did not comment. Rolls said it was co-operating with the authorities but would not discuss continuing investigations. A spokesperson said: “Concerns about bribery and corruption involving intermediaries in a number of overseas markets remain subject to examination by the SFO and other authorities. We are co-operating with the authorities.\n“We do not comment on the subject of ongoing investigations nor on the countries in which those investigations are being conducted. We have made it clear that Rolls-Royce will not tolerate business misconduct of any kind.”\nIn 2012 Rolls said it had asked a leading law firm, reported to be Debevoise & Plimpton, to conduct a review and this raised matters of concern in Indonesia, China and other markets. The company said it had passed on a file to the SFO.\nThere have also been questions about Rolls’ conduct in Brazil.\nThe company has faced a tough trading environment, with orders from oil industry customers for power systems being cancelled due to the falling crude price. It has issued a number of profit warnings and earlier this year cut its dividend payout for the first time in 25 years.\n"

        "text": "\nMore than one in four business leaders believe bribery and corruption is rife in the UK, according to survey conducted by accountants EY.\nTwenty-eight per cent of UK respondents said corruption was widespread – an increase from 18% a year earlier – although lower than the 39% average of respondents to the survey conducted in 62 countries.\n“Our survey finds that more than one in four executives in the UK believe that bribery and corrupt practices happen here, a worryingly high number in a country that prides itself on its strong corporate governance,” said EY’s Jim McCurry.\nNinety-eight per cent of UK respondents to its 14th annual global fraud survey also said they recognised the importance of being able to establish the ownership of entities with which they are doing business – a factor highlighted in the publication of the Panama Papers earlier this month.\nOverall, 91% of the 3,000 senior executives from 62 countries who took part in the survey supported enhanced beneficial ownership transparency. \nLast week in Washington, George Osborne and his counterparts from France, Germany, Spain and Italy announced new rules that will lead to the automatic sharing of information about the true owners of complex shell companies and overseas trusts.\nThe chancellor said the enhancing regulations were “a hammer blow against those that would illegally evade taxes and hide their wealth in the dark corners of the financial system”.\nThe survey, conducted before the details of 11.5m files from the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca were made public, also found that half of all respondents were prepared to justify unethical behaviour to meet financial targets. This was a greater proportion than the 36% that could justify such behaviour to help a company survive in an economic downturn.\nThe EY report said: “Worryingly, deeper analysis of our survey results identifies that many respondents who are [chief financial officers] and finance team members, individuals with key roles in protecting companies from risks, appear ready to justify unethical conduct. The apparent willingness of these respondents to act unethically when under financial pressure is concerning. Could certain compensation arrangements be encouraging such behaviours?”\nThe survey found that respondents, though, believed that bribery and corruption did not take place in their own sectors. While 39% globally said they believed it happened in their country, only 11% said they thought it was the case in their sector.\n“Bribery and corruption continue to represent a substantial threat to sluggish global growth and fragile financial markets,” the report said. “Despite increased regulatory activity, our research finds that boards could do significantly more to protect both themselves and their companies.”\nRespondents in the UK also regard cybercrime as a high risk, with 80% of respondents citing it as a concern – more than elsewhere in the world.\n“With the continuing enforcement of anticorruption measures, coupled with recent revelations about the misuse of offshore financial structures, business leaders here need to be focused on securing a deeper understanding of their clients, partners and suppliers. Enhanced transparence is only likely to rise up the political and public agenda, both here and in the rest of the world,” said McCurry.\nHe said EY, which itself has a tax practice, complied with ethical standards.\nEY conducted 2,825 interviews 62 countries with executives responsible for tackling fraud – 50 of them were in the UK.\n"

        "text": "\nAs an enforced child soldier, Rodrigue Katembo saw his little brother die and had to carry the news to his mother. Now 41, he remains on the frontline – but today he protects the extraordinary wildlife in the national parks of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) from armed militias.\nIt is exceptionally dangerous work: 160 park rangers have been killed protecting Virunga national park in the last 15 years, outnumbered 10 to one by militias and poachers. Around the world, about 1,000 rangers have died in the line of duty over the last decade. But Katembo, who is awarded the prestigious Goldman environmental prize on Monday, is resolute, despite the attacks he has endured and the risks he continues to run.\n\n\n\n\nHonour for environmental activist farmer, 83, surrounded by mines on three sides\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“It is really worth it to make this sacrifice,” he told the Guardian. “I know it is among the most dangerous work in DRC, but I am working for the welfare of future generations.” His goal is to protect the rainforests and savannahs of Congo’s parks, and the endangered mountain gorillas, lions and elephants they contain, and build a sustainable way of life for the many thousands of people living there.\nKatembo has made heavy personal sacrifices in the fight against the corruption that helps fuel the destruction. In 2013, just days after stopping an oil-related development, he was arrested. “I was tortured and put in jail for 17 days,” he said, adding that he also suffered mock executions. “That was a really difficult time for me and my family as we didn’t know if I was going to die in prison or not.” \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  At great risk to his life, Katembo went undercover to document and release information about bribery and corruption in the quest to drill for oil in Virunga national park. Photograph: Goldman Environmental Prize\n\n\nKatembo survived and in 2015 the company pursuing oil in Virunga, a Unesco world heritage site, abandoned its plans. However, continuing death threats from poachers, armed rebels and illegal miners led to his transfer to Upemba national park, though even there he has to live apart from his family for their safety.\n\n\n\n\n2017 Goldman environmental prize recipients – in pictures\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe source of Katembo’s courage and determination began with his love of the natural world: “Since I was very young, I really wanted to become part of the wildlife authority of Congo.”\nThe best moments in his dangerous job are in the bush, he says: “Many times as a chief warden, you take your rangers on patrol. You look at tracks and follow the wildlife, but every time you do that you are amazed at the beauty of the wildlife of Congo. Every time you see new things and make new discoveries – it’s marvellous.”\nKatembo lists his successes with pride: “We saw the population of hippos in Virunga go from 500 to 1,700 in three to four years – that was a really important moment for me. In Upemba in 2015, we only had 54 zebra, we now have 72. We had no elephants inside the park, but now we have 68.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  A pod of hippopotamus spotted during a wildlife patrol in Virunga national park. Photograph: Xavier Gilbert, courtesy of Rodrigue Katembo/Goldman Environmental Prize\n\n\nKatembo’s early love of wildlife and desire to serve his war-torn country was derailed at the age of 14. “One of the armed groups tricked me and said they were going to bring me to university,” he says. “In the end, I started to be a child soldier. Many of the youths that tried to run away were killed. But I stayed there for two years.”\n“I was then able to go home during some holidays,” Katembo says. “I had to tell my mother that my younger brother had been killed in front of my eyes. My mother really fought to try to stop me having to return and I was able to escape. My mother then did everything she could to pay for my schooling and thanks to her I was able to study.”\nKatembo joined the DRC wildlife authority in 2003, which funded further study, and he has risen fast. He says he takes strength from the teams he works with but also from the responsibility he bears: “It is really important they trust me and see in me someone whose leadership is bringing them support and who is giving an example.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Katembo leads a counter-poaching operation in Virunga’s central sector. Photograph: Xavier Gilbert, courtesy of Rodrigue Katembo/Goldman Environmental Prize\n\n\nHis work in Upemba is daunting. The park covers 1.75m hectares and contains spectacular wildlife, including leopards and the Katanga impala, found only there. But there are also gold, emeralds and coltan – a highly valuable ore used in electronics - which draws illegal mining. Katembo has already closed down eight coltan mines and removed 1,400 small-scale miners.\nBut the murderous Katanga Mai Mai militia have infiltrated the park, making the need for more resources even more urgent. Katembo has just 160 rangers, far short of the 400 needed, and a single patrol truck.\nNonetheless, Katembo is not ready to back down from the fight. “It is not the time to do something else. When we see how many [groups] are trying to destroy our protected areas, we cannot stop now. If I left, that would feel like a betrayal to the protections the wildlife and national parks deserve. I also need to ensure a new generation of young Congolese are there to take up the baton.”\n"

        "text": "\nSir John Rose, the former chief executive of Rolls-Royce, has been questioned under caution as part of the Serious Fraud Office’s investigation into a corruption scandal at the engineering group.\nRose is one of a “large number” of former Rolls-Royce executives to have been interviewed under caution, according to sources familiar with the inquiry. This involves legal rights being read out to the individual being questioned and is not the same as being questioned as a witness. The interviews are often voluntary, with the individual invited to attend by investigators.\nRose also left his position as a director of two organisations in recent weeks. He resigned as director of the Eden Trust, owner of the Eden Project in Cornwall, on 27 January, just 10 days after Rolls-Royce and the SFO announced the company had agreed to pay £671m to settle allegations it bribed middlemen around the world between 1989 and 2013. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Sir John Rose was chief executive of Rolls-Royce from 1996 to 2011. Photograph: Shaun Curry/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\nRose was appointed as an Eden Trust director in August 2006. The Eden Project said: “The Eden Project can confirm that Sir John Rose has completed his term with the Eden Trust and retired as a trustee after more than 10 years on the board. We are very grateful to Sir John for his many years of support and guidance.”\nRose also resigned as a director of Ombu, which invests in industrial technology companies, on 30 November, according to records at Companies House. Mark King, the former head of civil aerospace at Rolls-Royce, also stepped down as chairman of Open Energi, one of the companies Ombu has invested in, on 23 January. A company spokesman said King would remain on the board as a non-executive and that the change was part of a management reshuffle.\nThe £671m payment by Rolls-Royce, of which nearly £500m will be paid to UK authorities, is the biggest ever penalty for criminal conduct for a British company.\nIn his judgment in the high court on the deferred prosecution agreement, the settlement between the SFO and Rolls-Royce, Sir Brian Leveson said the company had conducted “the most serious breaches of the criminal law in the areas of bribery and corruption” and that some of the allegations “implicated senior management and, on the face of it, controlling minds of the company”.\nLeveson said the charges against Rolls-Royce were “devastating and of the very greatest gravity”. He also said in his judgment that the company had been aware of corruption allegations in 2010 but decided not to notify the authorities.\nHowever, the judge praised the cooperation of the company’s existing management with the investigation and said all the key players involved in the scandal had left.\nDavid Green, the SFO director, has said it intends to announce within the next few months whether it will bring charges against individuals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Rolls-Royce will be in the spotlight again next week when it publishes its full-year results. Photograph: Gary Marshall/Rolls-Royce/PA\n\n\nThe questioning of Rose, who ran the aircraft engine maker from 1996 to 2011, was first reported by the Financial Times.\nThe SFO declined to comment on Rose or confirm how many Rolls-Royce executives had been interviewed. Rose denies any wrongdoing and has not been charged. He declined to comment, as did the law firm representing him, WilmerHale.\nStephen Pollard, the lawyer representing Rose, previously defended the Barings Bank rogue trader Nick Leeson and property tycoon Vincent Tchenguiz in his successful fight against the SFO.\nWhile boss of Rolls-Royce, Rose was regarded as a captain of industry and a leading figure in British business. When Rose announced his retirement from Rolls-Royce in 2010, Sir Vince Cable, then the business secretary, described him as a “champion of UK advanced manufacturing” and praised the “huge contribution he’s made to strategic thinking both within business and government on growing global market share”.\nRolls-Royce will be in the spotlight again next week when the FTSE 100 company publishes its full-year results. Warren East, the current chief executive, has already apologised for the scandal and said the behaviour uncovered by the SFO and other authorities was “completely unacceptable”.\nEast is likely to face further questions about the scandal, including what changes have been made at Rolls-Royce and whether the company could lose contracts as a result of its damaged reputation. \n"

        "text": "\nWill Donald Trump as president be good or bad for stock markets? Should investors run for the hills in fear of 1930s-style protectionist policies that may damage global trade? Or should they hang around to enjoy the possible fruits of promised tax cuts and massive infrastructure spending in the US?\nThe debate rages fiercely and daily. Each twitch in the stock market is taken as support for one side of the argument or the other. The Dow Jones industrial average in the US has passed 20,000 for the first time because it is anticipating goodies in store; alternatively, it hasn’t moved terribly far since mid December. Both statements are accurate. \nMeanwhile, it is almost obligatory for economists and pundits to be confident about what lies ahead for investors. If there is a rough consensus, it’s that a big fiscal stimulus in the US would eventually encounter the stiff breezes of a strong dollar and higher interest rates, and there is a risk of a bust one day if Trumpist protectionism becomes truly heavy. That extremely loose working theory seems as good as any.\nBut here’s a sharper take on the great guessing game from Terry Smith, whose £9bn Fundsmith equity fund has performed strongly since its launch in 2010 (disclosure: I am an investor). This is Smith’s shortlist of macro factors that could affect companies and markets in the near future: Brexit, China, “demonetisation” in India, the French presidential election, the German election, interest rates, Korea, Trump, quantitative easing by the European Central Bank, Syria and the oil price.\nSmith’s point is that even if you could read developments vaguely well and get your timing right, there is a second-order problem. “To usefully employ your predictions, you would not only have to make mostly correct predictions, but you would also need to gauge what the markets expected to occur in order to predict how they would react. Good luck with that,” he says.\nWell, quite. One way or another, Trump’s policies – not just the economic ones – will have a profound effect on financial markets. So will some or all of Smith’s other factors. It could hardly be otherwise. But there should be no shame in saying the investment implications are currently as clear as mud.\nHonours for business people should be going, going, gong\nSir Philip Hampton, the chairman of GlaxoSmithKline and former chairman of Royal Bank of Scotland, offered an excellent argument the other day for why highly paid business folk should not get knighthoods.\nSenior businessmen and women tend to be showered with so much money that it would be better to reserve the honours system for those who don’t get to collect big bucks. “I think to get both financial rewards and other recognition is just a bit too easy,” said Hampton (who, it should be pointed out, got his gong for public service).\nWell said. Hampton could have added a second argument. Business careers can only be judged properly when they are over, and often some time after that. This is the Fred Goodwin problem. The former chief executive of RBS (before Hampton’s time) was a hero until the bank sank. Goodwin was stripped of his knighthood. James Crosby, former chief executive of HBOS, the other great British banking disaster, gave his award back before he could suffer a similar fate.\nSir Philip Green still has a gong (for now), but even if the Topshop owner eventually coughs up a few hundred million quid for the BHS pension fund, it’s hard to imagine it would be awarded today. Labour is also calling for Sir John Rose, the former chief executive of Rolls-Royce, to lose his knighthood after the engine manufacturing company admitted to bribery and corruption during his period at the top.\nHanding out mid-career gongs is like awarding medals for a marathon while the race is still in progress. Most directors’ contracts at FTSE 100 companies these days acknowledge the point as it applies to bonuses, by including clawback clauses. A knighthood that could be routinely clawed back would be a nonsense – the Goodwin case caused a huge kerfuffle, remember. Better just to drop the gongs for corporate business leaders.\nInvestors lose appetite for Restaurant Group\nShares in Restaurant Group were overcooked at 700p a year ago. Now they’re 300p, and the 13% decline on Wednesday indicates investors’ loss of appetite. You can’t blame them. The chief executive, Andy McCue, recruited to revitalise a group that includes Garfunkel’s and Frankie & Benny’s, is impressed by “my colleagues’ passion”, but little else, it seems. The only things wrong are the prices, the menus and the service. In the restaurant game, that’s all you’re offering. “Significant change” is required. You bet.\n"

        "text": "\nTheresa May and her constituency party received political donations totalling almost £20,000 from a company run by a construction tycoon who was later convicted of paying bribes to Saddam Hussein’s regime.\nAnnual donations were accepted by May’s Maidenhead constituency party between 2003 and 2006 despite Guardian investigations that highlighted corruption allegations levelled at David Mabey’s bridge manufacturing business.\n\n\n\n\nThe Guardian view on Theresa May: new PM, same old problems | Editorial\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome of the donations, which came from a Mabey subsidiary called Beachley Property Ltd, were accepted even after it was reported in December 2005 that the Serious Fraud Office had begun looking into allegations of kickback payments in Iraq from another corner of the tycoon’s business empire. He was found guilty of corruption in 2011, receiving an eight-month sentence.\nThe general election of 2005 was a critical time for May, who was defending a majority of just 3,284. Her seat had been targeted by Liberal Democrats, prompting wealthy Tory donors, including Michael Ashcroft, to inject additional funds into her campaign coffers.\nParliament’s register of members’ interests shows May declared donations in 2005 from two companies separately controlled by Lord Ashcroft and Mabey. The filings do not explain how much of Beachley’s donations to Maidenhead Conservatives was spent on May’s campaigning or her work as an MP.\nAsked if the prime minister had ever met Mabey or discussed with him bribery allegations made about his business, a spokesperson for May declined to comment. “Maidenhead Conservative Association received these donations between 2003 and 2006, in full compliance with electoral law,” the spokesperson said. “The court case referred to took place a number of years after the donations were made to the association.”\nMabey, 54, who together with his family has a fortune estimated at £214m, briefly became Britain’s richest convict in 2011 after he was sentenced to eight months in prison for his part in making corrupt payments from a company called Mabey & Johnson, in breach of UN sanctions, ten years earlier. He was also disqualified from acting as a company director for two years.\nMabey was furious at being targeted for prosecution by the SFO and has always insisted that, while corrupt payments had been made by M&J, he had never known about them. But a jury at Southwark crown court found otherwise, and his subsequent appeal efforts failed. The jury had heard how in 2001, M&J won a €4.2m (then £2.6m) contract from the Iraqi ministry of construction to supply 13 steel modular bridges. Bribes representing 10% of the cost of the contract were secretly paid into bank accounts in Jordan.\nTwo years before Mabey’s conviction, multiple findings of bribery linked to M&J contracts around the world had led to the company pleading guilty to making corrupt payments – not just in Iraq, but also in Jamaica and Ghana. M&J was ordered to pay fines, legal costs and reparations to foreign governments totalling £6.6m.\nIn court, the SFO argued there had been a culture of bribery (pdf) within M&J, sanctioned by certain directors. This was denied. The prosecution alleged there had been corrupt payments linked to M&J in other countries – including Angola, Madagascar and Mozambique – though no charges were brought in relation to these claims.\nAfter Mabey was found guilty in 2011 of his role in corrupt payments over the Iraqi contract, Judge Geoffrey Rivlin QC said of him: “When a director of a major company plays even a small part, he can expect to receive a custodial sentence.”\nMabey could not be reached for comment, but in a statement Mabey Group – which is still ultimately owned by him and his family – said: “Since 2010, following the conclusion of the historic bribery and corruption issues, Mabey companies have been managed in a different way with an independent chairman and executive management team, and extensive and approved procedures to prevent bribery and corruption. Historically the company’s former management donated to their local constituency party, but the last political party donation was made in 2006 and the company policy now is not to make political donations.”\n"

        "text": "\nThe scale of pay deals on offer in FTSE 100 boardrooms has been illustrated by the latest payout to Sir Martin Sorrell, who was awarded more than £40m in 2016 taking the total payout to the chief executive of marketing and advertising company WPP in the past five years to more than £200m.\nThe long-term bonus payments to Sorrell were published alongside the latest pay deals at oil company Shell, which revealed its chief executive’s pay had risen 54% in 2016. Ben van Beurden received €8.6m (£7m) in 2016, taking his pay since he took the helm of the Anglo-Dutch company in 2014 to £35m. \nMajor stock market listed companies are revealing the pay of their top executives at a time of renewed scrutiny of corporate Britain since the vote for Brexit and the warning by Theresa May that she would curb boardroom excess. \nSome companies have already heeded attempts by shareholders to respond to the political backdrop, notably Imperial Brands, the maker of Gauloises and John Player cigarettes, which scrapped a pay rise for chief executive Alison Cooper in the face of a potential protest at its annual meeting in January.\nAmong other companies publishing details of pay deals on Thursday was Rolls-Royce, which paid annual bonuses to its executive for the first time in three years. Its chief executive, Warren East, who is leading the clean-up operation of the engine-maker after its £671m charge to settle bribery and corruption charges with the Serious Fraud Office and authorities in the US and Brazil, received a £916,000 bonus taking his total pay to £2m.\nAfter Royal Bank of Scotland revealed on Wednesday it had handed £16m in bonuses to its top executives, Barclays disclosed its top management had been granted £9m in future bonuses and shared £13.6m from bonuses paid out in the past.\nThe pay of WPP’s Sorrell has been a flashpoint in the past. In 2012 - during what became known as the shareholder spring - nearly 60% of investors rejected his annual pay package for the previous year.\nIt sparked changes to his pay deals which were generated by the leadership equity acquisition plan (Leap) which has payed out multi-million pound share deals for Sorrell.\nThe latest £41.6m payout is the last from the Leap scheme, which will be replaced with a less generous deal which investors expect to pay out less than £20m. The near £42m will be added to Sorrell’s salary, bonus and other extras when WPPpublish its annual report and will probably push his full remuneration for 2016to closer to £50m. \nWPP said the payout from the Leap is down 34% on the £62.8m he received last year.\n\n\n\n\nSorrell: companies that offend good governance tend to perform better\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince 2012, Sorrell has received close to £210m in total remuneration, which has consistently ranked him the highest-paid chief executive in the FTSE 100.\nDespite WPP’s pledge to overhaul executive pay, shareholders have continued to issue rebukes: in 2014, 30% refused to endorse Sorrell’s remuneration and last year, a third refused to back the £70.4m he received, one of the biggest pay cheques in UK corporate history.\n“This is the final outcome of the wholly performance-related Leap scheme which was replaced in 2013 with a new long-term scheme with a much-reduced opportunity approved by share owners,” said a WPP spokesman.\nLast year, Sorrell defended his pay package arguing he had put three decades of his life into building WPP from a maker of wire baskets into a £21bn global marketing business.\n“I’m not a Johnny come lately who picked a company up and turned it round [for a big payday],” he said. “If it was one five-year plan and we buggered off, fine [to criticise my pay]. Over those 31 years … I have taken a significant degree of risk. [WPP] is where my wealth is. It is long effort over a long period of time.”\nIn December, the chair of WPP’s pay committee, Sir John Hood, told MPs that Sorrell was not on a “superstar” salary.\nThe annual report for Shell shows that van Beurden’s €8.6m follows €5.5m in 2013 and €24.1m in 2014, his first year at the helm when his pay was inflated by by pension payments and “tax equalisation” handouts. It shows that 10% of future bonuses will be linked to managing greenhouse gas emissions.\nShell also reveals the debate going on among some investors who want to end the current system of long-term incentive plans, paying out over three years, with awards of restricted shares which do not have performance criteria. The oil company is not yet doing this because of the lack of agreement among shareholders.\nRolls-Royce, which recently reported the biggest annual loss in its history – £4.6bn - revealed that some of its shareholders thought the executive bonuses should be bigger. \n"

        "title": "Vast losses at RBS are a legacy of a failed system | Will Hutton",
        "date": "2017-02-26T00:05:15Z",
        "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/feb/26/banking-crisis-financial-fines-rbs-bailout",
        "text": "\nIt may have been nine years ago, but the financial crisis continues to throw its long shadow over Britain. Last week, RBS, at the time of the crisis the world’s biggest bank, announced another stunning loss of £7bn – so chalking up cumulatively some £58bn of losses since 2008.\nIt is now even clearer than it was at the time that had the government not stepped in, taking a vast £45bn stake, RBS would have gone bust, threatening a more widespread banking panic with cascading consequences hard to contain. At the very least, Britain would have had an even deeper recession – and much slower recovery. At worst, there would have been a full-scale depression.\nIn one way, £45bn has rarely been better spent; but, in another, a clutch of hard questions that would have been asked if the bank had gone bust were avoided. How could it be that RBS’s managers and shareholders could ever have allowed it to grow so large when so much of what it was doing was not just valueless, but actively value destroying? Why was the wider financial and regulatory ecosystem of which RBS was a part not more alert to what was going on, and instead, to an extent, egging the bank on? What system could permit a business horror story with such near-calamitous results; and even so was part of an inequitable capitalism that helped trigger the resentments contributing to Brexit?\nFor RBS is not alone in losing its way so badly. Too many great names in British business have revealed feet of clay in the past few years. Rolls-Royce has paid £671m in penalties to the UK, US and Brazilian governments to settle bribery and corruption claims in 12 countries. Tesco had to take huge writedowns over scarcely credible, large-scale accounting irregularities. British banks have paid more than £53bn in fines for misconduct, notably in the mis-selling of personal protection insurance policies, over the past 15 years. Then there are the never-ending accounting and contractual irregularities that plague the public outsourcing industry, from Serco to G4S.\nIt is not only a British phenomenon – Germany’s Volkswagen remains at the heart of a swirling scandal in tricking regulators over the emissions of its diesel engines. But, as global investment managers will acknowledge, British companies seem disproportionately caught out by serious irregularities in accounting. But then British companies, largely because of the way their fragmented shareholder base interacts with the stock market and the injunctions of British company law, are uniquely under pressure to provide good short-term financial results.\n\n\n\n\n \n\nBritish companies, because of their fragmented shareholder base, are under pressure to provide good short-term results\n\n\nThere was a collective sigh of relief last week when, after just 48 hours, Kraft Heinz withdrew its opportunistic £115bn bid for Unilever – a company that has consistently taken a long-term view in building an environmentally sustainable business. But if Unilever is to stay independent and protect its values, it is going to have to apply to itself – even if more judiciously – the flint-eyed treatment that Kraft Heinz would have administered. Loyal shareholders, if they are to stay loyal, are going to have to be rewarded quickly and generously. Last week, post the bid, Unilever announced it would do just that.\nPeople at large know these issues are fundamental, but business and finance seem distant, difficult-to-understand worlds over which nobody, let alone governments, seem to have much leverage. If you hold with a Corbyn-type philosophy, it is proof positive that the only solution to today’s capitalism is socialist transformation – but it is a view few share. The 20th-century experience of attempted socialist transformations is hardly encouraging. In any case, if you have regular contact with senior business executives, what is impressive is their enthusiasm to build businesses and create value rather than a hunger to exploit their workforce and cut corners.\nThe trouble is that too often it does not come out that way: they are prisoners of a business ecosystem over which they too feel they have little leverage – plunged into a dog eat dog world in which honest-to-Ggod business building is rarely the priority.\nWhat has to change is the architecture in which British companies operate, so that it gives better expression for the best of business intent. Nor is this just of corporate interest. Britain’s indifferent record in innovation and investment, its poor productivity and even the inequalities of income between regions – among the worst in the industrialised world – are linked umbilically to the way much business is compelled to behave. To its credit, the May government, publishing green papers on corporate governance and industrial strategy in quick succession, recognises this truth. The difficulty is to identify what should follow.\nQueue Big Innovation’s Purposeful Company Task Force, set up 20 months ago, with the aim of plugging the gap (full declaration: I co-chair it). Having marshalled the evidence last spring which proves that companies which put their purpose before profit outperform companies that do not, tomorrow it releases its policy report. The report’s innovation is to think systemically across how company law, financial reporting, executive pay, the investment management industry, shareholding structures and financial flows could all be reformed in a way that cumulatively represents a new settlement for British capitalism.\nBetter still, the recommendations build on many current initiatives whose general direction in a statement of core beliefs is supported by a cross-section of companies, investment houses and advisory firms.\nFor the first time in my career, there is an alignment between a critical mass of business which recognises the system in which it operates needs to be re-engineered, a government that agrees, and a set of recommendations that could be implemented. Change could happen. Purposeful companies could be built.\nIt is a watershed moment. When the task force was launched, we hoped it would make a difference, but addressing these questions was a minority sport. Not today, with Brexit looming – and beyond it the digital revolution and environmental and demographic challenges. Britain has needed a different capitalism for decades, but it has taken the reality of leaving the EU to drive the point home. Perhaps, just perhaps, it might happen – a silver lining in otherwise very dark clouds.\n"

        "text": "\nRolls-Royce will report one of the biggest losses in British corporate history this week as Brexit and a corruption scandal leave an indelible mark on the famous aerospace company.\nCity analysts have forecast that Rolls could report a pre-tax loss of more than £4bn – its worst ever – due to the sharp decline in the value of the pound and the £671m penalty that the company has agreed to pay to settle corruption allegations.\nAccounting rules mean Rolls will be forced to write down the value of its currency hedges to reflect sterling’s slump. The pound has lost almost a fifth of its value against the dollar since Britain voted to leave the EU last June. Rolls hedges billions of pounds of cash to protect itself against currency fluctuations because deals in the aerospace industry are conducted in dollars.\nThe financial results will also recognise the impact of the £671m penalty that Rolls agreed with authorities in the UK, US and Brazil to settle corruption charges. Although Rolls will make the payment over five years – with £293m expected to be paid in the first year – it is likely to recognise the full cost in the latest accounts as an impairment charge.\nThe pre-tax loss will be the biggest in the history of Rolls, although it is a non-cash loss that reflects a change in the value of assets in its accounts rather than cash actually leaving the business. The biggest loss in British history is the £24bn recorded by Royal Bank of Scotland for 2008. RBS reported another £8.3bn loss for 2013, while Vodafone reported a £22bn loss in 2006 and a £13.5bn loss in 2002. Other milestones include a £8.5bn loss for HBOS in 2008 after it was bought by Lloyds, £6.5bn for Cable & Wireless in 2003, Tesco’s £6.4bn in 2015, and £4.5bn for BP last year.\nWarren East, Rolls’s chief executive, will face questions about the corruption scandal when he presents the results, such as how it was allowed to happen, what has been done to ensure it does not happen again, and whether the company could lose contracts due to the damage to its reputation.\nHe has already apologised and called the behaviour that was uncovered “completely unacceptable”. However, an industry source said he was prepared to “address the issue front and centre and not shy away from it”.\nRolls agreed to the settlement over allegations that it bribed middlemen around the world between 1989 and 2013 to win contracts.\nSir Brian Leveson, who approved the so-called deferred prosecution in court, said the SFO’s investigation into Rolls had revealed “the most serious breaches of the criminal law in the areas of bribery and corruption” and that some of the charges “implicated senior management and, on the face of it, controlling minds of the company”.\nHowever, the judge praised the co-operation of the company’s existing management, which allowed Rolls to settle with the SFO rather than face a damaging criminal trial.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Rolls-Royce’s chief executive, Warren East. Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\n\nDespite the penalty and the record loss, East is likely to be in a positive mood when he presents the results. This is because the underlying performance of Rolls is gradually improving.\nThe company has already told shareholders that it enjoyed a “good finish” to the year, with underlying profit – which excludes the impact of sterling’s decline and the SFO penalty – ahead of expectations. The consensus in the City is that underlying profits in 2016 were £687m, down from £1.4bn in 2015. However, they are predicting a rise back to £861m this year.\nEast has been trying to overhaul the engine-maker since replacing John Rishton as chief executive in 2015. He inherited a company that was struggling after a long run of success. Revenues were falling for the first time in a decade and underlying profits were down, prompting East to cut the dividend payout for shareholders for the first time in 24 years in 2016.\nRolls, which makes engines for Boeing’s 787 Dreamliners and Airbus’s A380 superjumbos among others, has been affected by lower-than expected demand for the wide-bodied airliners to which it supplies engines. But it has also been hurt by cuts to defence spending and the decline in the oil price, which has lowered demand from the offshore oil and gas industry for its marine products.\nA year ago, in a sign of the pressure on the company, Rolls was forced to appoint the chief operating officer of ValueAct to its board after the US activist investor built up a stake and called for change. Since then however, Bradley Singer, ValueAct’s representative, has stayed quiet, publicly at least.\nMeanwhile, East has focused on making Rolls more efficient and accelerating the pace at which it builds engines. He has cut hundreds of middle and senior managers and by the end of 2017 wants to have cut £200m of annual costs. The Rolls boss has effectively backed the company’s technology – and its pipeline of future development – but wants it to be a better manufacturer.\nHoward Wheeldon, a veteran defence and aerospace analysts, said that East had “taken the bulls by the horns”. He said: “Rolls was paying the price for making a few mistakes in the past. They did not focus on efficiency. They are now, but they didn’t. They allowed the company to become middle-heavy, and top-heavy actually.”\nThe settlement with the SFO ends a four-year probe – although individuals linked to allegations are still being investigated – and Wheeldon said Rolls could now focus on its future.\n“What happened was a negative, but the positive is that we now have a settlement,” he said. “They can now move on with more clarity than they have in the last four years. They are on course with the plan they set out, but there is still a long, long way to go.”\n"

'No comment'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLord Justice Leveson’s overall judgment on Rolls-Royce\n“Against that background [of the size and importance of Rolls to the UK], it can properly be described as devastating and of the very greatest gravity that the conduct of this institution should fall to be examined within the context of a criminal investigation, and that the investigation (in very large part conducted and voluntarily revealed to the SFO by Rolls-Royce itself) should reveal the most serious breaches of the criminal law in the areas of bribery and corruption (some of which implicated senior management and, on the face of it, controlling minds of the company).”\nOn the charges against the company\n“The conduct involved senior (on the face of it, very senior) Rolls-Royce employees.”\nRolls-Royce’s co-operation with the Serious Fraud Office\n“This has been far more extensive than was identified in the public domain; it included written reports revealing further corruption indications and a report concerning conduct Rolls-Royce had known about since 2010 and previously (under different leadership) decided not to notify.”\nExtract from statement of facts on the case, which was put to court by Serious Fraud Office and the company\n“In 1999 RR [Rolls-Royce] issued its first written policy governing the use of intermediaries, administered by MS [marketing services division]. No process for due diligence was specified. Additional approval was required from a senior RR employee where the proposed payment exceeded 5% of the contract price. A revised policy in 2003 extended this additional approval process also to require approval from RR’s CEO.”\nExtract from statement of facts on corruption in Indonesia\n“RR senior employees agreed to pay $2.25m and a Rolls-Royce Silver Spirit car to an intermediary or company controlled by that intermediary.”\nMore on Indonesia\n“An internal RR memo dated 17 December 1991, which was sent to RR senior employees, noted that Intermediary 1 had interpreted a previous conversation with an RR employee as a promise to reward him with a Rolls-Royce car if the A330 [Airbus aircraft] deal was won. The memo noted that the car was not part of the CAA [commercial consulting agreement] but: “One way or another we are going to have to deliver, and recover the costs as best we can. Seen against the future business, particularly in the military field, where to [Intermediary 1] could be obstructive, the cost is not great. I am asking for the best price we can get for a Silver Sprint II.”\nExtract from statement of facts on corruption in Thailand\n“By the end of February 1992 a total of $4.75m had been paid to Intermediary 3. Two of the sums making up that total figure ($1.9m and $2.4m) were authorised at the point of payment by an RR senior employee.”\n\n\n\n\nRolls-Royce lobbied ministers to weaken anti-bribery proposals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on Thailand\n“In November 1996 an internal RR memo noted that the same employee of Thai [Airways] had asked an RR senior employee to ‘release’ $1m of the $5m which remained to be paid to Intermediary 3. The memo recommended that payment be made now ‘so that Thai can use it to “manage the political process”. ’89. Three RR senior employees agreed to this.’”\nExtract from statement of facts on corruption in India\n“On or around 23 May 2005, MS [marketing services division] informed an RR senior employee that the £1m was approved in return for securing the £7.5m fee and confirmed that MS supported the proposal. Additional approval was provided by the RR senior employee. On or around 3 June 2005, a more senior RR employee was briefed and, following his approval, all four of the new CCAs [commercial consulting agreements] were signed by RR from 12 July 2005 onwards.

        "text": "\nRolls-Royce, Britain’s leading multinational manufacturer, is to pay £671m in penalties after long-running investigations into claims it paid bribes to land export contracts.\nThe settlement means the engineering giant will avoid being prosecuted by anti-corruption investigators in the UK, US and Brazil, though individual executives may still be charged.\nIt comes five years after investigators across three continents first began examining claims that the £13bn multinational had paid bribes to secure contracts in countries around the world.\n\n\n\n\nRolls-Royce’s SFO settlement is big, ugly and serious\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast year a joint Guardian and BBC Panorama investigation identified 12 countries in which Rolls-Royce had hired “commercial agents” or advisers to help it secure high-value contracts.\nAnti-corruption campaigners said the deal showed the British government was not serious about tackling bribery, despite years of rhetoric promising to make the UK a hostile environment for the corrupt.\nSusan Hawley, the policy director of Corruption Watch, described the settlement as “proof the UK is not willing to prosecute a large, politically connected company”. \nRobert Barrington, the executive director of Transparency International, said “there must be a prosecution of individuals” in addition to the settlement.\n\n\n\n\nRolls-Royce middlemen may have used bribes to land major contracts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn deals announced on Monday, Rolls-Royce said it would pay £497m to the UK Serious Fraud Office (SFO), subject to approval by the high court. It will also pay $169m (£140m) in penalties to the US Department of Justice and $25m to the Brazilian authorities.\nThe terms of the agreement with the SFO are to be examined on Tuesday by Sir Brian Leveson QC, the president of the Queen’s bench division of the high court. Under the proposed deal, known as a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA), Rolls-Royce will pay the penalties over five years, along with a payment covering the SFO’s costs.\nRolls-Royce announced that it reached separate deals with the US Department of Justice and Brazilian prosecutors. It added: “These agreements relate to bribery and corruption involving intermediaries in a number of overseas markets, concerns about which the company passed to the SFO from 2012 onwards.\n“These are voluntary agreements which result in the suspension of a prosecution provided that the company fulfils certain requirements, including the payment of a financial penalty.”\nThe anti-bribery investigations have been embarrassing for the multinational, which sells turbines and engines for passenger jets and military aircraft across the globe. \nDavid Cameron once praised it as “a world leader in the development of advanced technologies … of which the whole country can be proud”. The Duke of Cambridge called it “one of the United Kingdom’s great global companies”.\nThe firm has had close relations with British governments of all political hues, while ministers have often lobbied foreign governments to give large export contracts to the manufacturer.\nWithout admitting any wrongdoing, Rolls-Royce has repeatedly attempted to signal its willingness to reform after the bribery allegations emerged. \nIn 2013 the company hired the prominent City lawyer Lord Gold to conduct a review of its anti-corruption and compliance procedures. The following year the company used its annual report to reveal that it had substantially reduced its use of third parties to help it secure contracts.\nThe company’s chief executive said last year that winning contracts legitimately was key to future growth. Warren East, who took the helm in 2015, said in an interview with the Guardian that the bribery scandal was “not a very desirable situation”.\nHawley said: “The extent and egregious nature of the allegations against Rolls-Royce – and the fact that all indications are that it didn’t actually self-report, but this came from a whistleblower – really raise questions about whether this is being done as a convenient form for Rolls-Royce to carry on getting public contracts.”\nCompanies are supposed to refer themselves to investigators in order to qualify for a deferred prosecution agreement. If convicted of corruption offences, a company can be barred from bidding for public contracts unless it were able to prove it had reformed.\nA relatively recent development in British law, a DPA is an arrangement under which a company can halt investigations against it for a fine. If further wrongdoing were to be committed during the duration of the agreement, the original prosecution could be reactivated.\nBarrington said: “The fine is an eye-catching size, much bigger than any previous deferred prosecution agreement. Transparency International has always that the DPA must only be used when it is in the public interest, so information needs to be put into the public domain about this investigation.\n“The critical part is that there must be a prosecution of individuals. There is criminality here, and we would like to see the SFO set out a timeline for those prosecutions.”\nHe said he was encouraged to see Brazilian, US and British regulators working together. “It will send a shiver down the spine of bribe-payers,” he said.\nSources close to the negotiations said the SFO and Rolls-Royce attended a preliminary court hearing on Monday, with a statement being issued as the markets closed. \nIt is understood that the Brazilian authorities have allowed Rolls-Royce to sign a leniency agreement, which is similar to a DPA.\nThe SFO has had at least 30 investigators in the UK focused on the multinational’s use of agents or middlemen to clinch export contracts in a number of countries across several strands of its business. \nRolls-Royce’s sprawling organisation has customers in more than 150 countries, including more than 400 airlines and leasing customers. \nThe Guardian and BBC’s Panorama reported that agents have been hired in Angola, Azerbaijan, Brazil, India, China, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and South Africa.\n• This article was amended on 17 January 2016.

        "text": "\nDavid Green, the director of the Serious Fraud Office, has warned that British businesses should not consider deferred prosecution agreements (DPAs) the “new normal” if they are caught misbehaving.\nGreen was speaking to the Observer after Tesco and the SFO announced they had reached a DPA over the accounting scandal that rocked Britain’s biggest retailer in 2014. The settlement includes a fine of £129m to be paid by Tesco.\nDPAs allow companies to settle with the SFO without facing criminal prosecution. The companies must agree to specified conditions, which can include a fine and their conduct being monitored for a set period.\nUsed in the US for some time now, DPAs were introduced in the UK only three years ago. The Tesco case is the fourth time the SFO has used its new power: it previously reached settlements with Standard Bank, Rolls-Royce and a third company that cannot be named for legal reasons. The Tesco deal still needs high court approval: a hearing is scheduled for 10 April.\nGetting such well-known British companies to pay huge fines could be construed as a major victory for the SFO, which suffered a setback last year, after City brokers were found not guilty of helping Tom Hayes rig Libor interest rates. Rolls agreed to pay £671m to the SFO and the US Department of Justice over allegations that it bribed middle men around the world between 1989 and 2013.\nHowever, Green is keen to clarify that DPAs are not the only route that the SFO will take when investigating companies. This is are significant because the fraud-busting agency is still investigating alleged wrongdoing at several other huge companies, including Barclays, GlaxoSmithKline and Airbus, maker of the A380 superjumbo.\nThe Barclays case is particularly high-profile, involving not one of the biggest banks in the world and a key plank of the UK economy, but also Qatar, a major investor in Britain that only last week committed to investing £5bn here – a move viewed as a significant vote of confidence in the wake of the Brexit vote.\nThe SFO’s investigation centres on whether £2bn that Barclays lent to Qatar was then returned to the bank as part of the £7.3bn bailout that saved Barclays at the height of the financial crisis. Barclays turned to Middle Eastern investors at the time to avoid falling into state ownership. Green and his team are now close to making a decision on whether to formally charge Barclays and former senior executives at the bank, to drop the case, or to seek a DPA.\nSpeaking about DPAs in general, Green said: “We are an investigating and prosecuting organisation: that is what we do. But having been given this new power, which comes from a US model, and has been adapted for this jurisdiction, we will use it only in very specific circumstances.\n“Absolutely crucial to those circumstances is that the company has been fully cooperative with us. There is a reason for that. Unlike with the American model, a judge over here has to decide whether or not the DPA is in the interest of justice. That is quite a high bar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  DPAs are not a soft option, says SFO director David Green. Photograph: Getty Images\n\n\n“If a company is totally uncooperative and sort of leads us a merry dance for four or five years by not cooperating with our investigation, I am sure you would agree that it would be almost impossible for us to represent to the judge that the DPA was in the interests of justice. Companies that don’t cooperate will be prosecuted. Indeed, their conduct may be so egregious that they have to be prosecuted anyway and a DPA wouldn’t be appropriate.”\nThese comments could be significant in Barclays’s case, because the bank has clashed with the SFO during its investigation, which was launched in August 2012. For example, the SFO had to go to court to try to force Barclays to hand over potential evidence after the bank claimed it was protected by legal privilege. Legal privilege ensures that advice between a lawyer and client is kept confidential. Eventually the bank partially waived privilege and handed over 100,000 documents.\nAsked whether his comments meant that a DPA could be ruled out for Barclays, Green said: “I couldn’t comment on that. All I would say is that it is only companies that cooperate with us which we would consider a DPA for.”\nThe SFO boss said last year that the organisation’s decision on the Barclays case could be reached by the end of March. However, with March now passed, Green says that a decision could come by the end of May.\n“We don’t work to timetables; we work to proper decisions on the evidence,” he said. “I think for all sorts of reasons it is safer to look probably at the end of May.”\nOn whether the SFO’s decision will be affected by the importance of Barclays and Qatar to the economy, he added: “Any charging decision is always based on the code test with crown prosecutions. Firstly there is the evidential test – is there sufficient evidence? If there isn’t then you don’t have to go any further, that’s it.\n“If there is sufficient evidence, then you look at the public interest – is it in the public interest to conduct this particular prosecution? Obviously there, all sorts of considerations come into play. In bribery cases you are specifically not allowed under OECD rules to take into account the national economic interest.”\nWhatever the SFO’s decision on Barclays, DPAs will be one of Green’s legacies as the director of the SFO. He took over in 2012 when it was facing heavy criticism for its botched arrest of tycoons Robert and Vincent Tchenguiz. One of Green’s first acts as director was to drop the investigation into the brothers.\nGreen pushed for DPAs to be introduced in the UK and then oversaw the first settlements in the UK. These have meant that high-profile investigations have resulted in companies paying out hundreds of millions of pounds, when previously the UK has struggled to prosecute firms.\n“It is always satisfactory to be able to use a new statutory power in a positive way, and to use it properly,” he said. “But prosecutors are a fairly sober bunch. No one sits around celebrating – you are working on evidence, and we are just making use of a new power that has been given to us.”\nGreen’s four-year contract as director was extended last year until 20 April 2018. However, the SFO boss does not intend to stay beyond that. “I think six years is probably long enough,” he said.\nAlthough critics of DPAs say the settlements allow companies to walk away from serious offences, Barry Vitou, head of global corporate crime at London law firm Pinsent Masons, said that they should be seen as a success and something that secures the future of the SFO. The body’s existence has been questioned in the past by politicians – including by Theresa May, who as home secretary considered rolling it into a National Crime Agency.\n“There is a stark contrast between the SFO when he started and the SFO in 2017. If you talk to anybody, the SFO is working,” Vitou said.\nThe lawyer added that DPAs could ensure that innocent employees of a company were not punished for the misdeeds of others.\n“Personally I think we should look at them as a success,” he said. “The previous set-up wasn’t working. The reality is that you can’t put a company in prison; the biggest hit you can impose is an economic fine. It is deeply unjust for all apples in the barrel to suffer when two rotten apples in the barrel did something they shouldn’t. There is no economic sense in pushing a company like Rolls-Royce to its knees.”\nDone deals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  The Tesco DPA includes a fine of £129m. Photograph: Rui Vieira/PA\n\n\nTescoTesco has agreed with the SFO to pay a fine of £129m as part of a DPA, although this deal requires court approval. The DPA relates to false accounting at Tesco subsidiary Tesco Stores Ltd, and is not an admittance by the company that it or any of its employees committed a criminal offence. The settlements relate to Tesco’s admitting, in 2014, that it had overstated profits by £326m. Dave Lewis, chief executive of Tesco, said the settlement allowed the retailer to “move on”. Lewis took over as boss of Tesco after the false accounting incident took place\nRolls-RoyceRolls-Royce and the SFO announced in January that the aerospace and defence company had agreed to pay £671m in relation to allegations that it bribed middle men around the world between 1989 and 2013. Sir Brian Leveson, the judge who approved the DPA, said the SFO investigation had uncovered “the most serious breaches of the criminal law in the areas of bribery and corruption”. However, he approved the DPA because the management of Rolls, which has been overhauled since the bribery took place, cooperated extensively with the SFO, even providing evidence and reports that the organisation had not requested.\n"

If Brexit occurs there will almost inevitably be a period of uncertainty, and uncertainty is what we can’t cope with.\n“We’re making investment decisions all the time about where to place different parts of our operation, and uncertainty created by Brexit puts a lot of those decisions on hold and that pause is something that our US competitors don’t have to cope with.

Major customers include the European aircraft maker Airbus.\nIts largest UK plant is in Derby, where it designs, tests and assembles Trent jet engines.\n“We have to deal with whatever the outcome happens to be,” East said. “All we’re saying today is, a Brexit result would likely lead to a period of uncertainty.\n“We need to make investment decisions throughout that period, we’re going to be held back by uncertainty, and we could do without that. But we’re going to continue to be a global leader no matter what.”\nRolls has faced difficult times recently, issuing a string of profit warnings and cutting its dividend for the first time in almost 25 years.\nThe FTSE 100 company is also the subject of an ongoing investigation by the Serious Fraud Office, following allegations of bribery and corruption in Indonesia and China.\nEast said that since he was appointed chief executive almost 12 months ago, he had not witnessed any problems with the culture of the business.\n“I don’t think that is a problem which existed then and it certainly doesn’t exist today. We will tolerate absolutely no improper behaviour whatsoever and I think every one of our 50,000 plus employees is well aware of that. It’s well known there is an SFO investigation going on into some historical practices.\n“We have some of our facilities that need modernisation, and some of our processes, practices and behaviours also need modernisation.”\n"

        "text": "\nCorruption is the most neglected human rights violation of our time. It fuels injustice, inequality and depravation, and is a major catalyst for migration and terrorism.\nIn Africa, the social and political consequences of corruption rob nations of resources and potential, and drive inequality, resentment and radicalisation. Corruption cheats the continent’s governments of some $50bn (£38bn) annually, and stymies successful cities, sustainable economies and safe societies.\n\n\n\n\nKeep your eyes open, speak out: we can fight the menace of corruption in Nigeria\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA joint report by the African Development Bank and Global Financial Integrity found that up to 65% of this lost revenue disappeared in commercial transactions by multinational companies. According to Oxfam, as much as 30% of African financial wealth is estimated to be held offshore, costing an estimated $14bn (£10bn) in lost tax revenues every year. \nThis corruption discourages donors and destroys investor confidence, strangling development, progress and prosperity. \nAdded to that, across the continent, sociopolitical dissatisfaction at corruption provides fertile ground for radicalisation, and some extremist organisations are adept at portraying Islamism as the solution to such injustice.\nFor example, corruption stimulates recruitment of young Nigerians into the ranks of Boko Haram. In a recent study, 70% of those interviewed in the state of Sokoto cited corruption as a factor driving radicalisation.\nBy understanding corruption’s full impact and seeing it through the eyes of its victims, we can create new weapons to combat it. This is worth considering as we approach the first-year review of the sustainable development goals. Among them is SDG 16, which aims to reduce bribery and corruption, develop accountable institutions, cut the flow of illicit money and weapons, and strengthen the recovery and return of stolen assets.\nMore can be done at a global level to support these ambitions. Bilateral trade agreements should be based on commitments to end corruption and protect human rights, and protocols to prevent corruption should be built into development aid and loans.\nThere are some encouraging signs on the continent. When leaders from countries such as Kenya, Rwanda, Nigeria and Tanzania highlight corruption as a major threat to their countries, then we might just be seeing the final days of impunity. The test now is whether they deliver on these fresh anti-corruption promises in credible ways that take account of human rights. \nHuman rights are enforced by international treaties, backed by judicial bodies with teeth such as the international criminal court, the international court of justice and regional bodies such as the African court on human and people’s rights. The UN security council and the African Union’s peace and security council can impose sanctions in response to violations of political, economic, social or cultural rights, or to deal with torture, genocide and war crimes. On top of that, countries and international bodies have an obligation to act when human rights are breached.\n\n\n\n\nAfrica losing billions from fraud and tax avoidance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYet there is no such obligation to act against endemic corruption. International agreements define various corrupt practices as a crime, but not corruption itself. Instead, it is passively defined as a technical flaw in governance, its horrors disguised in legalese. Corruption’s victims get little mention.\nThat’s why so little progress has been made by the UN convention against corruption (Uncac). This global agreement elevated anti-corruption action to the world stage. But Uncac relies on states for implementation, and – unlike global protocols governing human rights – there is no effective sanction for those in breach. An absence of enforcement creates space for corrupt officials and businesspeople to hide without fear of pursuit or prosecution. And there is little political will to change things.\nWe need to give Uncac muscle by joining the moral and legal dots between corruption, human rights abuses and international crimes. Acknowledging the negative human rights impact of corruption makes it imperative for African states to provide better protection to their citizens. Africans have the most at stake in getting anti-corruption efforts to work, because corruption disproportionately affects poor people.\nA more rights-based approach to corruption is a good strategy for both African and European governments. It would mean greater political stability, and provide an environment for sustained social and economic development. This, in turn, would have a positive effect on the drivers of conflict, terrorism and migration. \nThe human rights community built an arsenal to protect people. Now anti-corruption activists need to do the same. \n\nAnton du Plessis is executive director of the Institute for Security Studies in South Africa\n\n"

        "text": "\nThe former Fifa president Sepp Blatter is facing another corruption investigation after the ethics committee of world football’s governing body announced it was opening proceedings against him and his key lieutenants Jérôme Valcke and Markus Kattner.\nThe committee’s investigatory chamber will investigate possible violations of Fifa’s rule book that relate to bribery, conflicts of interest and general conduct, while Kattner faces a further charge related to a breach of confidentiality.\nThe case is understood to be based on the huge salaries and bonuses the three men allegedly paid themselves at Fifa, and the alleged leaking of information about new Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, to the media.\n\n\n\n\nReal Madrid and Atlético Madrid lose appeals against Fifa transfer ban\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA statement on the governing body’s website on Friday confirmed that Djimbaraye Bourngar, the deputy chairman of the investigatory chamber of the ethics committee, had begun formal proceedings against the trio.\n“The investigatory chamber will investigate possible violations of art. 13 (General rules of conduct), art. 15 (Loyalty), art. 19 (Conflicts of interest), art. 20 (Offering and accepting gifts and other benefits) and art. 21 (Bribery and corruption) of the Fifa Code of Ethics (FCE) in the context of salaries and bonuses paid to Mr Blatter, Mr Valcke and Mr Kattner as well as other provisions included in the contracts of these three individuals,” read the statement.\n“Furthermore, the investigatory chamber will investigate a possible violation of art. 16 (Confidentiality) of the FCE by Mr Kattner.\n“Under the Fifa Code of Ethics, the investigatory chamber shall examine all circumstances of the cases equally. For reasons linked to privacy rights and the presumption of innocence until proven guilty, the investigatory chamber will not publish further details at the present time.”\nThe 80-year-old Blatter, who ran Fifa from 1998 to 2015, is currently waiting for the result of his appeal against an existing ban from football for a payment he made to former protege and Uefa president Michel Platini.\nThat appeal was heard at the court of arbitration for sport last month and if Platini’s earlier case is a guide, football’s most infamous administrator can expect a reduction in his ban from six years to four.\nValcke, who served as Blatter’s right-hand man from 2007 to 2015, has also already been banned from all football activities by Fifa. The 55-year-old Frenchman was given a 12-year ban in February for misconduct related to his expenses, the use of Fifa resources and the sale of World Cup tickets.\nKattner, who was Valcke’s deputy, has not been sanctioned before but was unceremoniously sacked in May.\nA month later, the American law firm Fifa hired to help repair the damage from its well-documented corruption scandal alleged that Blatter, Kattner and Valcke had shared £60m in pay rises and bonuses between 2011 and 2015.\nThis information has been passed onto the Swiss authorities as they appear to breach corporate governance laws.\nWith the careers of these men in sports politics already surely finished, it is debatable what more Fifa can do to them. But this move may provide some good clues as to how that Swiss criminal inquiry will go. It will also give Infantino another chance to show his commitment to a fresh start at Fifa’s Zurich headquarters.\nThe need for him to keep doing that cannot be underestimated as the earlier Swiss and US investigations into Fifa’s wider corrupt practices over the last decade or so continue, and the Swiss are still looking at the 2010 decision to award the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to Russia and Qatar respectively.\nAnd if that was not bad enough, there are also inquiries under way into the 2006 and 2010 World Cups that could bring even more embarrassment and shame to Fifa’s door.\nMeanwhile, former Fifa vice-president Jeffrey Webb has been banned from all football-related activities for life and fined £770,000.\nThe 51-year-old from the Cayman Islands was once considered a future leader of world football’s governing body but that prospect ended when he was arrested in Switzerland last May by local police acting on behalf of the United States Department of Justice.\nWebb, who ran the Concacag confederation which governs football in the Caribbean and North and Central America, pleaded guilty to racketeering, wire fraud and money laundering in November.\nHe has been provisionally suspended by Fifa since his arrest but the adjudicatory chamber of its ethics committee has now handed him its most serious sentence.\n"

        "text": "\nNarendra Modi came to power in India on a promise to end corruption. Halfway into his tenure, little seems to have happened to achieve this goal. The most obvious steps – such as taking a strong line on the known illegal accounts held in Swiss banks and tax havens, or ending the ability to hold shares without revealing your identity, or making funding of political parties transparent – have simply not been taken. People were beginning to murmur that the government had not lived up to its grandiose promises.\n\n\n\n\nYour money's no good: rupee note cancellation plunges India into panic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo last week Modi did some more of the smoke and mirrors stuff that he is so good at: a shock announcement in a blaze of publicity designed to show that he is serious about ending corruption, even though the actual impact is quite different. At 8pm on Tuesday evening he announced that from midnight all 500-rupee (£6) and 1,000-rupee notes would cease to be legal tender. He said this would flush out all the black money and get rid of the counterfeit notes that were being used by terrorists in their nefarious activities.\nDemonetisation of bank notes is a common practice, but it is usually done gradually, allowing time for people to replace the old notes with new ones to prevent too much disruption of economic activity. By contrast this overnight shock is hugely destabilising. The suddenness is supposed to prevent hoarders of cash being able to use it to buy other assets – but that is a poor argument, since the government could have simply announced a time-bound demonetisation and then tracked large transactions.\nIn fact, only a small proportion of the funds received from illicit tax-evading activities is kept in the form of cash, and almost never by large players. They tend instead to buy real estate and other property, hold gold and stocks and shares and, most of all, move the money abroad. So this move touches only a tiny fraction of the assets accumulated through illegal activities. In any case, it also does nothing to control the source: not just bribery and corruption, but also inaccurate invoicing by companies, under-reporting of sales values and overstating costs, reporting non-existent transactions and so on. These don’t require cash: they are easier and faster using electronic means. Money on its own has no particular colour; as it flows through different transactions, it changes from white to black to grey.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Indians queue outside a bank in Allahabad to exchange 500- and 1,000-rupee notes. Photograph: Sanjay Kanojia/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\nBut currency notes are absolutely crucial to India’s legal market economy. The two cancelled notes account for 86% of all the currency in circulation; over 90% of all transactions are conducted in cash, and over 85% of workers get their incomes in cash. With one stroke Modi dealt a crippling blow to all such exchange, affecting not just the “black market” he was supposedly targeting, but also almost every Indian. Ironically, the rich – more likely to be “cashless” – are relatively unscathed; it is the poor and the middle classes, hugely reliant on currency for daily activities, who are being battered.\nThe resulting chaos has been enormous, and shows no signs of ending. Pitfalls with Modi’s grand plan have been worsened by implementation ineptitude. Not enough new currency has been made available, so cash machines are empty and banks are stretched beyond capacity. People have been wasting hours in queues to collect small amounts of cash that are insufficient for normal activity. The new notes have come in the form of an even higher denomination (2,000 rupees) that is unhelpful for daily transactions, since no one has enough change for this amount.\nThe problems go beyond inconvenience. The lack of cash has reduced consumption and demand, which has had a knock-on effect on sales, traders’ incomes, production and employment. Traders are losing perishable stocks, daily labourers cannot find work because employers cannot pay in new notes, and small producers (who mostly don’t get bank loans) cannot get working capital from the moneylenders they rely on. Individual tragedies abound, with children not being fed, an inability to buy medicines for the sick, and, it is being reported, more than two dozen people dying while standing in queues, or being unable to pay for hospitals and medicines with the old money.\n\n\n\n\n \n\nFarmers cannot afford to 'bear the pain for 50 days', as Modi asked in his emotional appeal\n\n\nFarmers are in dire straits, some with freshly harvested crops that cannot be sold, others unable to purchase inputs for the next sowing season. They cannot afford to “bear the pain for 50 days”, as Modi asked in his emotional appeal, because they stand to lose everything for the last crop and for the coming one. And Indian women, 80% of whom don’t have a bank account, may now find they have to use their stashes of cash, and risk losing control of it, especially in the face of domestic abuse.\nIronically, a flourishing black market has emerged for the old notes, trading at a 20% discount. Big players can get away with a small loss and plan on restarting their illegal activities once the new notes are fully in circulation, since nothing is being done about that. But no one will compensate the millions of Indians who have lost incomes and employment in the intervening period. No wonder, when the government claimed that its latest “surgical strike” would involve some collateral damage, the Indian supreme court said this was more like a carpet bombing.\nModi’s penchant for optics rather than substance was always annoying; but this time it has acquired truly damaging proportions.\n"

        "text": "\nKim Jong-nam was almost certainly murdered by North Korean agents, according to intelligence officials in South Korea, as suspicions mounted that his assassination at Kuala Lumpur airport was ordered by his estranged half-brother, the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un.\n\n\n\n\nDeath of Kim Jong-nam: depictions of North Korea hide threat of dictatorship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth Korea’s spy agency said on Wednesday that two women believed to be North Korean operatives poisoned the 45-year-old exile in a shopping concourse at Kuala Lumpur international airport.\nKim, who had not yet passed through security, was preparing to take a late-morning flight on Monday from the Malaysian capital to his home in Macau, according to South Korean MPs briefed by security services.\nSelangor state’s police chief, Abdul Samah Mat, told the Guardian that Kim Jong-nam arrived in Malaysia on 6 February, a week before he was attacked. “He was travelling on a North Korean passport,” he said. “The postmortem is in progress. It’s up to the pathologists on how long it will take. Sometimes it involves lab tests.”\nUS government sources also said they believed that Kim Jong-nam was murdered by North Korean assassins.\nJapan’s Kyodo news agency quoted an unnamed Japanese government official as saying that the two suspected assailants may already be dead, but offered no further details.\nThe theory that Kim had been targeted by spies from the country he left more than 15 years ago gathered pace after Malaysian officials released CCTV image purporting to show one of the alleged attackers as she waited for a taxi outside the airport shortly after the incident.\n\n\nLIM Yun Suk \n(@yunsukCNA)\nCCTV pictures taken from #Malaysia airport showing one of the two women suspected to have killed Kim Jong Nam, half-brother of Kim Jong-Un. pic.twitter.com/otcjrvjYts\n\nFebruary 15, 2017\n\n\nThe local Malay Mail newspaper published a grainy photo of a woman it said was suspected by police of killing Kim Jong-nam. The image showed a young female, carrying a bag and wearing a white jumper that said “LOL” in large black print across the front. The Guardian has been unable to confirm if the woman is a police suspect.\nKim, whose father was the late North Korean leader Kim Jong-il, claimed to have no political ambitions, but just weeks after his half-brother’s elevation to the leadership in late 2011 he told the Japanese journalist Yoji Gomi that the world would view his leadership as a “joke”.\nIn the same email exchange with Gomi, Kim spoke disparagingly of his younger brother, saying he lacked “any sense of duty or seriousness” and warned that bribery and corruption would lead to North Korea’s eventual collapse. Two years earlier, he told Japan’s TV Asahi that he “personally opposed” the hereditary transfer of power in his family.\n\nFamily tree\n\nPeople with contacts in the north believe Kim Jong-un had long targeted his brother, who reportedly divided his time between Macau, China and Singapore, and enjoyed some level of Chinese protection.\nSouth Korean intelligence officials claimed the regime had been planning his assassination for five years, but did not explain why they thought that was the case.\nKim Jong-nam was once considered the heir apparent to the North Korean leadership but left the country to lead a life in exile after attempting to enter Japan on a forged Dominican Republic passport in 2001 – an incident that caused embarrassment to his father. Kim had told Japanese immigration officials that he was planning to visit Tokyo Disneyland.\nJiro Ishimaru, of the Osaka-based Asia Press, said Kim’s murder could only have been ordered by his half-brother, whom he had never met.\n“Any criticism of the Kim dynasty is viewed as unforgivable, no matter where it comes from,” Ishimaru told the Guardian. “It’s the worst thing you can say about the regime, and certainly not the kind of comment that the leadership would be able to shrug off, no matter how long ago it was said.\n“The only person inside North Korea with the power to decide whether Kim Jong-nam lived or died is Kim Jong-un.”\nMark Tokola, vice-president of the Korea Economic Institute in Washington and a former deputy chief of mission at the US embassy in Seoul, agreed, saying: “It seems probable that the motivation for the murder was a continuing sense of paranoia on the part of Kim Jong-un.”\nAlthough there was scant evidence that Kim Jong-nam was plotting against the leader, he provided an alternative for North Koreans who want to depose his brother.\nKim Jong-nam had told airport workers that someone had attacked him “from behind” and sprayed him in the face with an unknown liquid. He died in an ambulance on the way to hospital.\n\n\n\n\nThe Guardian view on North Korea: the real cause for concern | Editorial\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“He told the receptionist at the departure hall that someone had grabbed his face from behind and splashed some liquid on him,” said Selangor state’s criminal investigation chief, Fadzil Ahmat, according to Malaysia’s The Star newspaper.\n“He asked for help and was immediately sent to the airport’s clinic. At this point, he was experiencing headache and was on the verge of passing out. At the clinic, the victim experienced a mild seizure. He was put into an ambulance and was being taken to the Putrajaya hospital when he was pronounced dead.”\nMalaysian police confirmed the death of a 45-year-old North Korean man whom it identified from his travel document as Kim Chol, born in Pyongyang. “Investigation is in progress and a postmortem examination request has been made to ascertain the cause of death,” the statement said.\nSouth Korea’s government called an emergency security council meeting and condemned Kim’s death. “If the murder of Kim Jong-nam was confirmed to be committed by the North Korean regime, that would clearly depict the brutality and inhumanity of the Kim Jong-un regime,” the country’s acting president, Hwang Kyo-ahn, said.\nIn exile, Kim Jong-nam had largely managed to stay out of the spotlight. He had lived both in mainland China and Macau, and was also spotted in Malaysia. He reportedly fled to Singapore from Macau in 2012, fearing for his life after his brother assumed power, and suspecting that the regime’s agents had discovered where he lived.\nIt is not clear if he had returned in recent years, but his family – his second wife and their three children – were living in the former Portuguese colony. A South Korean MP claimed Kim also had a wife and son in Beijing.\nHe was known to travel around Macau without bodyguards, and was occasionally spotted at nightclubs in the Hotel Lisboa, according to a 2007 investigation by the South China Morning Post.\nSince becoming leader in late 2011, Kim Jong-un has sought to tighten his grip on power by ordering the purges and, in some cases, executions of high-level officials he believes represent a threat to the regime. The most high-profile victim was his uncle and close adviser, Jang Song-thaek, who was executed on several charges, including treason, in 2013.\nNorth Korean assassins reportedly tried to shoot Kim Jong-nam in Macau in 2011, although details of the incident are shrouded in mystery. South Korea also reportedly jailed a North Korean spy in 2012 who admitted to trying to organise a hit-and-run targeting Kim in China in 2010.\nKim reportedly pleaded for his life after another attempt to kill him in 2012, according to South Korean lawmakers who had been briefed by the head of the country’s national intelligence service, Lee Byung-ho.\n“According to [Lee] … there was one [assassination] bid in 2012, and Jong-nam in April 2012 sent a letter to Kim Jong-un saying: ‘Please spare me and my family,’” Kim Byung-kee, a member of the parliamentary intelligence committee, told reporters.\nAgencies contributed to this report\n"

        "title": "Hurrah for the industrial strategy. At last Britain has a plan",
        "date": "2017-01-22T06:59:23Z",
        "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/22/government-industrial-strategy-greg-clark-car-industry",
        "text": "\nThe government is this week scheduled to unveil its industrial strategy for Britain. It promises to be a fascinating document. Although this industrial strategy has received far less publicity than Brexit, it could have a more significant long-term impact on Britain then leaving the European Union. But that impact depends on the government not only producing a substantial plan but also sticking to it over years and parliaments, which will not be an easy task.\nUntil Theresa May made her speech on Brexit last week, there were growing fears in the business world that the industrial strategy could be a damp squib. It is understood that there have been splits within government about how detailed the industrial strategy should be – because of fears that it could show Britain’s hand too early in negotiations with the EU on Brexit.\nSo while Greg Clark, the business, energy and industrial strategy secretary, understandably wanted to produce a weighty plan, those in the department for exiting the European Union were wary about the government telling the world which industries it considers most important.\nIn her speech, the prime minister said not only that Britain intended to leave the single market, but that she wanted the country to be a cheerleader for global free trade – and she cited key sectors for this, including car manufacturing and financial services. By outlining Britain’s approach to Brexit negotiations, May gave the industrial strategy a platform to build on.\nThe contents of the strategy are likely to focus on what sectors the government believes have potential, how they will be supported, and how it intends to develop skills, infrastructure and research and development.\nThe prime minister established the new Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy soon after she succeeded David Cameron in July. That move in itself was a notable step away from Cameron’s approach.\nSajid Javid, Cameron’s business secretary, had expressed his dislike for government intervention and avoided the phrase industrial strategy altogether. His argument was that industries and companies who were not part of the strategy felt isolated.\nNonetheless, almost nine out of 10 business leaders surveyed by the influential Institute of Directors (IoD) said that they were in favour of an industrial strategy. Javid’s predecessors in the role of business secretary, Lord Mandelson and Sir Vince Cable, both happily adopted the concept.\nAlthough their industrial strategies were never put into writing, they formed task forces in the automotive and aerospace sectors made up of government figures and industry leaders. These so-called councils allowed the government to communicate regularly with chief executives in sectors it considered important, and to develop joint policies. It should be remembered that Javid’s laissez-faire approach ended in a tangle when he was forced to step in and offer financial support for the steel industry as thousands of jobs hung on the line.\nClark used to work for Boston Consulting Group, so drawing up a strategy should not be a problem for him. He has already provided clues about areas the industrial strategy will focus on.\nLast September, Clark told the IoD conference in London that the industrial strategy had to focus on local areas and that “for too long government policy has treated everywhere like it is identical”. He added: “Many of the policies and decisions that form our industrial strategy will not be about particular industries or sectors, but will be cross-cutting.”\nThen, in November, he said at a speech at Jaguar Land Rover that making Britain a world-leading hub for next-generation electric vehicles would be at the heart of the new strategy. He described the automotive sector, particularly electric vehicles, driverless cars and battery storage, as an “emblematic area of focus”.\nWe will find out this week how Clark and the government plan to electrify the economy. Even if the industrial strategy is just one page long, it will provide more clarity than Javid offered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Rolls-Royce: a tarnished brand? Photograph: Rolls Royce/PA\n\n\nSFO has done a good job on Rolls-Royce. But it shouldn’t stop there\nApart from the banks, it is hard to think of a bigger British corporate scandal than Rolls-Royce in the past two decades. If Brexit and Trump weren’t happening, the tale of bribery and corruption at Rolls-Royce over three decades would have been front-page news for days. To recap: a company long deemed one of the UK’s finest agreed to pay £671m in penalties via a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) with the Serious Fraud Office and parallel agreements in Brazil and the US. Rolls-Royce’s behaviour amounted to “egregious criminality,” according to the senior judge who approved the agreement.\nSir Brian Leveson’s comments and the statement of facts were admirably clear on what happened – such as the handing of $2.25m and a Rolls-Royce Silver Spirit car to an individual in Indonesia in exchange for a “favour to Rolls-Royce” – but silent on who was responsible. The silence was because individuals could still be prosecuted.\nBut note one aggravating feature described by Leveson: “The conduct involved senior (on the face of it, very senior) Rolls-Royce employees.” In another passage, the lawbreaking was said to implicate “senior management and, on the face of it, controlling minds of the company”.\nThe obvious question is whether any prosecutions will materialise. Due process must be followed, of course. But public confidence in DPAs – used by the SFO since 2013 – will be maintained only if they are not seen as allowing a company to make a legal problem go away by writing a large cheque.\nFor Rolls-Royce – whose board was praised for its full cooperation with the SFO – that must mean one of two outcomes. Either the relevant senior managers should be prosecuted where possible; or the SFO must provide compelling reasons why not.\nA fudged outcome, in which the question of individual prosecutions is perpetually delayed, would undermine faith in DPAs. The SFO was rightly praised last week for securing the settlement, but its work is not finished.\nSome of the things Soros says have to come true\nGeorge Soros, hedge fund speculator extraordinaire, has not become a star turn in Davos by being dull. His current opinions, shared with the gilded set at the Swiss shindig, were suitably bold. Donald Trump is a “would-be dictator” who is “going to fail”. Theresa May “will not last” and British people are “in denial” about the cost of Brexit. Financial markets will “not do very well”.\nHe may well turn out to be right in some or all of his views. But timing in markets is everything, as Soros, who made a fortune by betting against the pound on Black Wednesday in 1992, knows. A week after the UK referendum, he said the result had “unleashed a crisis in the markets comparable in severity only to that of 2007-08”. The squall passed and the FTSE 100 and Dow Jones are close to record highs. Never mind, Soros grabbed attention –the chief requirement at Davos.\n"

        "text": "\nThe co-author of a parliamentary report into the demise of BHS has called on the Serious Fraud Office to launch a formal inquiry into the actions of the department store chain’s former owners.\n\n\n\n\nIain Wright: the MP leading the fight against BHS and Sports Direct\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMP Frank Field, the chair of the work and pensions committee, has written to the head of the SFO asking the organisation to initiate an inquiry into whether Sir Philip Green or Dominic Chappell had broken the law.\nHis letter comes after a joint report published on Monday by Field’s committee and the business innovation and skills select committee concluded that Green had “systematically extracted hundreds of millions of pounds from BHS”.\nAll remaining BHS stores are expected to close by the end of August with the loss of 11,000 jobs after the business went into administration in April, 13 months after Green sold it to the former bankrupt Chappell for £1. The retirement savings of 22,000 current and former workers have also been hit as the firm’s pension fund was left with a deficit of £571m.\n\n\n\n\nRegulator must chase Philip Green for BHS pension cash\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn his letter to the SFO’s director, David Green, Field wrote that “in the light of the extraordinary evidence” received by both committees, the investigatory body should examine whether money was “moved in such a way as to attempt to mislead people into believing Mr Chappell was a credible buyer for BHS”.\nThe SFO has previously confirmed receipt of material relating to BHS which it is reviewing. It has not yet decided whether to launch a formal investigation.\nA SFO spokesperson said: “If the director considers there are reasonable grounds to suspect serious or complex fraud which meets his criteria, he will open a criminal investigation.”\nThe SFO is a specialist prosecuting authority that only tackles the top level of serious or complex fraud, bribery and corruption. When deciding whether to launch an inquiry, it considers whether any apparent criminal action “undermines UK PLC commercial or financial interests in general and in the City of London in particular”. \nIn weighing up whether to launch a formal investigation, it will also consider whether there is a public interest dimension and whether economic harm might be caused.\nMPs found that Chappell’s Retail Acquisitions failed a number of tests set by Green’s retail business to determine his credibility. Nonetheless, Green arranged £25m in financial assistance for Retail Acquisitions to help smooth through the deal. \nHe also helped Retail Acquisitions with a £10m contribution linked to a property deal, according to the parliamentary report. MPs concluded: “Sir Philip attempted to make good Retail Acquisitions’ financial inadequacies to facilitate the sale. He was both sides of the deal.”\nField told the Guardian that it was not clear why Green had gone to such lengths to assist Chappell. He said the SFO should carry out a thorough investigation to reassure the public that “no stone had been left unturned and nothing improper found” in relation to BHS.\nGreen declined to comment on Field’s letter, but has previously said he believed the MPs’ report was the “predetermined and inaccurate output of a biased and unfair process”.\nChappell told the Guardian: “I’m sure if the SFO had concerns they would be looking into it. I am totally of the belief that everything we did was accurate and correct.” \nThe former BHS boss said he was meeting his lawyers and planned a full response to the MPs’ report, but that it might take “a few weeks.” \nField’s letter comes after Green threatened legal action against him over his comments to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that the retail tycoon was the principal character in the collapse of BHS and “worse than Robert Maxwell”.\nGreen’s legal representatives say the MP’s statements, which refer to the former publisher of the Daily Mirror who had plundered the company’s pension fund, are defamatory and false. \nGreen is also threatening legal action against Chappell and the other members of Retail Acquisitions. The billionaire, who controls a string of high street chains including Topshop and Dorothy Perkins, alleges that Retail Acquisitions misused BHS funds and that Chappell falsely represented his business credentials.\nThe report by MPs has fuelled calls for Green to be stripped of his knighthood. It found the former owner of the chain had “systematically extracted hundreds of millions of pounds from BHS, paying very little tax and fantastically enriching himself and his family, leaving the company and its pension fund weakened to the point of the inevitable collapse of both”.\n"

        "text": "\nThe former Germany captain and coach Franz Beckenbauer is one of four officials to be investigated by Fifa following “possible undue payments and contracts” relating to the awarding of the 2006 World Cup tournament.\nGermany beat South Africa to win the rights to the tournament in 2000 but reports in October last year claimed a slush fund of 10.3 million Swiss francs (£4.8m) had been set up to buy votes. The German Football Association (DFB) denied this but Fifa’s ethics committee has opened formal proceedings against six officials in total after examining a report commissioned by the DFB.\nBeckenbauer, the former DFB president Theo Zwanziger, the former secretary general Horst Schmidt and former chief finance officer Stefan Hans will be investigated by Fifa. All were involved in Germany’s World Cup local organising committee, of which Beckenbauer was president.\nFifa’s investigatory chamber will also open proceedings against Wolfgang Niersbach, the former president of the DFB and current member of the Fifa and Uefa executive committees, and the former DFB secretary general Helmut Sandrock. The pair will be investigated for a “possible failure to report a breach” of the ethics code.\nNiersbach, who stepped down as president of the DFB in November, has previously insisted that the organising committee had acted both “fairly” and “legally”, saying: “The World Cup was not bought. What was a summer fairytale remains a summer fairytale.” However, Zwanziger later stated that a slush fund had existed.\nA Fifa statement read: “In the cases of Messrs Niersbach and Sandrock, the investigatory chamber will investigate a possible failure to report a breach of the Fifa code of ethics, which could constitute a breach of art. 13 (General rules of conduct), art. 15 (Loyalty), art. 18 (Duty of disclosure, cooperating and reporting) and art. 19 (Conflicts of interest) of the FCE.\n“In the cases of Mr Beckenbauer, Dr Zwanziger, Mr Schmidt and Mr Hans, the investigatory chamber will investigate possible undue payments and contracts to gain an advantage in the 2006 Fifa World Cup host selection and the associated funding, which could constitute a breach of arts 13, 15, 18 and 19 as well as art. 20 (Offering and accepting gifts and other benefits) and art. 21 (Bribery and corruption) of the Fifa code of ethics.”\nIn October, Beckenbauer, 70, rejected allegations of corruption, saying: “I never gave money to anyone in order to acquire votes so that Germany is awarded the 2006 World Cup. And I am certain that no other member of the bid committee did something like that.”\nIn November, German police raided the Frankfurt headquarters of the DFB and searched the homes of officials on suspicion of tax evasion linked to the awarding of the tournament, with documents and hard drives seized according to the German news agency DPA.\nLast month the Swiss-Italian football administrator Gianni Infantino was elected as Fifa’s new president, beating Bahrain’s Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim al-Khalifa in the race to succeed Sepp Blatter as head of the maligned world governing body.\n"

        "text": "\nJoão Havelange, the Brazilian who reshaped the football world before his reputation was tainted by corruption scandals, has died aged 100 during a Rio Olympics that he helped secure and is taking place in a stadium once named after him.\nIt was Havelange who paved the way for the huge commercial exploitation of major sporting events, including the Olympics and the World Cup, but also for the lurid allegations of bribery and corruption that have dogged them ever since.\nA former Olympic athlete, Havelange was an International Olympic Committee member from 1963 to 2011 and used his position at the head of the Brazilian FA (the CBF) during the golden period when his country won three World Cups, between 1958 and 1970, to launch a bid for control of Fifa.\nHis campaign to oust Sir Stanley Rous as president marked a decisive moment in world sport. The Englishman was seen as fusty and out of touch, representative of a colonial old guard trying to maintain their grip on a global game, while Havelange ushered in a new way of doing business that mixed personal, political and corporate interests until they became indistinguishable.\nWith the help of Horst Dassler, the Adidas scion who founded the sports marketing agency ISL, and Fifa’s young secretary general, Sepp Blatter, Havelange oversaw an explosion in the governing body’s revenues as broadcasting and sponsorship deals rolled in.\nAlong the way, it has been alleged, he was one of a great many sports executives who shared in the proceeds. In 2010, the BBC produced a list of individuals, which included Havelange, who received bribes totalling $100m from ISL through front companies.\nIn death as in life, Havelange took centre stage. The news of his passing quickly dominated headlines overshadowing the Olympic triumph of Brazil’s first gold in the pole vault for Thiago Braz da Silva.\n\n\n\n\nJoão Havelange obituary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe tone was respectful but far from universally laudatory. While newspapers noted Havelange had massively expanded Fifa and its finances, they also focused on his corrupt practices, obsession with power and occasional quarrels with Pelé.\nIn a piece titled “The worst kind of politics”, the influential columnist Juca Kfouri noted the behind-the-scenes deal-making of a figure who claimed to be free of ideological bias yet worked with Brazil’s military dictators and then built a global empire that was bigger than that of many nations or multinationals. “Havelange did the worst kind of politics when he claimed to be apolitical and he used this to justify his close relationship with dictatorships around the world, whether it was in Africa and South America,” Kfouri wrote. “It’s undeniable that he transformed Fifa into a great money-making machine and made football popular in the five continents. Unfortunately he did this with a family that even the Cosa Nostra [Italian mafia] has nothing on.”\nTV stations showed images of his life – black-and-white photographs of him as a lawyer and member of the Brazilian Olympic team at the 1936 Berlin Olympics, as head of the Brazilian Football Confederation during a period when his country won the World Cup three times, and then as president of Fifa from 1974 to 1998, when the world football body expanded its reach with a system of patronage that strengthened his grip and left a legacy of corruption that continues to this day.\nAllegations of bribe-taking dogged his career and his family. In 1993, his former ally Pelé accused Havelange’s son-in-law Ricardo Teixeira, the then president of the CBF, of corruption, a charge which was denied. Six years later a German newspaper reported Havelange had accepted diamonds and other gifts in connection with Amsterdam’s bid for the 1992 Olympics.\nIn 2006, the British investigative journalist Andrew Jennings told the Brazilian senate that Havelange may have built a fortune of tens of millions of dollars from bribes paid through a front company. He also revealed that a $1m bribe apparently meant for Havelange had crossed the desk of Blatter, who was later found by the Fifa ethics committee to have been “clumsy rather than criminal” in his handling of it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Brazil won three World Cups under Havelange’s presidency of the country’s confederation. Photograph: Associated Press\n\n\nIn 2011, Havelange resigned from the IOC citing health concerns, the day before he was to appear before an ethics committee investigating claims that he received a bribe of $1m from ISL.\nBut his influence continues to be felt. Estado de São Paulo noted that Havelange’s connection and ability to secure votes played a decisive role in securing the Olympics for Rio de Janeiro during the bidding competition. “I invite you all to come to my city, to honour the Games, on my 100th birthday. I ask you to join me to realise this dream,” he told delegates at the 2009 IOC meeting at which Rio was named the first South American city to host the Games.\nOn reaching his century on 8 May, he achieved that goal, though was too ill to take part in the Olympic torch relay that reached its conclusion in his home city of Rio. He died in the Samaritano hospital in the city’s Botafogo district on Tuesday morning. The hospital did not disclose the cause of death, but local media said it was pneumonia.\n \n\n\n\n\nJoão Havelange resigns as Fifa honorary president over 'bribes'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "text": "\nHouse Republicans were forced into a humiliating climbdown on Tuesday after Donald Trump tweeted criticism of their move to gut an independent congressional ethics watchdog.\nMembers ditched their plan to severely weaken the independent Office of Congressional Ethics (OCE) at an emergency meeting just before the start of a new legislative session on Capitol Hill in Washington.\nThe original rule change, carried out without warning and behind closed doors, had provoked a fierce backlash from Democrats and transparency activists when first announced on Monday night.\nBut it was flexing of muscles by the president-elect that appeared to force Republicans to cave in. “With all that Congress has to work on, do they really have to make the weakening of the Independent Ethics Watchdog, as unfair as it may be, their number one act and priority,” he tweeted on Tuesday morning. “Focus on tax reform, healthcare and so many other things of far greater importance!”\nTrump added the hashtag #DTS, for his campaign slogan “drain the swamp”.\nHis team confirmed it was the timing, not the reform itself, that had irked the president-elect. His incoming press secretary, Sean Spicer, told reporters: “He says their focus should be on tax reform and healthcare. It’s not a question of strengthening or weakening, it’s a question of priorities.”\nEven before Trump’s tweet, many House Republicans, including top leaders, opposed the measure and worried about its ramifications, the Associated Press reported. In addition, members of Congress were inundated with calls and complaints from the public, which may have played a part.\nAt the subsequent emergency meeting, House majority leader Kevin McCarthy of California, who had opposed the timing of the decision, reportedly offered a motion to restore the current OCE rules which was accepted by members. The House will instead study changes to the office ahead of a deadline in August.\nRepresentative Tom Cole of Oklahoma, a Republican, said: “People didn’t want this story on opening day.”\nLater McCarthy, walking through the Capitol building with an ice cream, was questioned about the climbdown. “I just thought when you look at the taskforce about the reforms that are needed, it’s better to do it bipartisan,” he said. “It was with unanimous consent.”\nHe denied that Trump’s tweets had played a part, saying: “No, no, no. Last night these are things I told people. From a standpoint, it’s better if people see the process. I just think it’s better that full bipartisan work on it together.”\nAsked if the reversal had been embarrassing for the party, McCarthy told the Guardian: “No reversal on my part. Same position I had the night before.”\nBut Representative Steve King of Iowa, who supported the measure and indeed would prefer to scrap the OCE altogether, insisted that Trump’s intervention had been crucial. “When President-elect Trump sent out his tweet, that gave license for the press and everybody else to pile on,” he said.\nThe abrupt reversal was welcomed by Democrats – but with a note of scepticism. House minority leader Nancy Pelosi said: “House Republicans showed their true colours last night, and reversing their plans to destroy the Office of Congressional Ethics will not obscure their clear contempt for ethics in the people’s house.\n“Once again, the American people have seen the toxic dysfunction of a Republican House that will do anything to further their special interest agenda, thwart transparency and undermine the public trust.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n \nPaul Ryan re-elected as speaker of House of Representatives\n\n\nGovernment accountability groups also expressed caution. Noah Bookbinder, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said: “The Office of Congressional Ethics is the only independent check on the House of Representatives. Without it we would return to a Congress awash in scandal.\nThe U-turn marked a public relations disaster for the party on a day when it hoped to hit the ground running with an ambitious agenda that includes dismantling Barack Obama’s healthcare policy. Republican senator Mike Enzi introduced a resolution allowing for the repeal of Obamacare on Tuesday, his office said in a statement.\nThe ethics office U-turn handed Trump a victory in what may prove a battle of wills over the next four years.\n\n\n\n\nTrump criticizes House Republicans for voting to eliminate ethics oversight\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is not the first time that Trump, a billionaire businessman often described as an outsider who mounted a “hostile takeover” of the Republican party, has been at odds with its rank and file. His intervention came on the day that the 115th Congress convened, with Republicans in control of both chambers, hoping that the incoming president will prove willing to sign long-planned bills into law.\nBut on the OCE issue, Trump did appear aligned with McCarthy and the House speaker, Paul Ryan, who had both urged their colleagues during the closed-door meeting to vote against the idea, arguing that it should be done later and on a bipartisan basis.\nBoth men then appeared to defend the move on Tuesday morning – “The office is still expected to take in complaints of wrongdoing from the public. It will still investigate them thoroughly and independently,” Ryan said – only for it to collapse at the emergency meeting, fuelling a sense of confusion and chaos before Trump is even inaugurated.\nThe OCE was conceived in 2008 to investigate allegations of misconduct after a series of bribery and corruption scandals that resulted in three members of Congress being sent to jail. \nThe Republicans’ plan would have barred the OCE from considering anonymous tips about potential ethics violations, seen by critics as a potential deterrent to whistleblowers, and would have meant the OCE would have fallen under the control of the House Ethics Committee, which is run by lawmakers. It would have been known as the Office of Congressional Complaint Review, and the rule change would have required that “any matter that may involve a violation of criminal law must be referred to the Committee on Ethics for potential referral to law enforcement agencies after an affirmative vote by the members”, according to the office of Representative Bob Goodlatte, a Republican from Virginia who pushed for the change. Lawmakers would have had the final say on their colleagues under the change.\nGoodlatte expressed disappointment: “Gross misrepresentation by opponents of my amendment, and the media willing to go along with this agenda, resulted in a flurry of misconceptions and unfounded claims about the true purpose of this amendment,” he said in a statement. “To be perfectly clear, the OCE has a serious and important role in the House, and my amendment would have done nothing to impede their work or lessen the high ethical standards to which all members of Congress should be held.”\nDuring the nomination process for Ryan as speaker and Pelosi as minority leader in the House on Tuesday, many Democrats said they were voting for Pelosi because “the people’s house should be ethical, accountable and open to free debate”. One said: “We should read the bills before we pass the bills.” There were heckles from Republicans.\nRyan won the election for speaker with 239 votes, while Pelosi notched 189. Republican Liz Cheney, daughter of former vice-president Dick Cheney, who won her father’s old House seat in Wyoming, sat beside her father in the crowded chamber, which included some members’ young children.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n \n‘America cannot afford a Twitter presidency’: 115th US Congress sworn in\n\n\nMeanwhile, addressing the Senate for the first time as minority leader, Chuck Schumer, of New York, implored Trump not to abandon the promise of change that helped elect him.\n\n\n\n\nTrump's cabinet picks: here are all of the appointments so far\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Making America Great Again requires more than 140 characters per issue,” Schumer said of the president-elect’s habit of sparking outcry with a single tweet. “With all due respect, America cannot afford a Twitter presidency.”\nHe added: “On January 20, we won’t be in reality TV – we’ll be in reality.”\nVice-president Joe Biden, who also serves as the president of the Senate, presided over the swearing-in ceremony for a historic class of new senators. Among them were Catherine Cortez Masto, of Nevada, who is the first Latina senator, Kamala Harris, of California, the first Indian American senator, and Tammy Duckworth, of Illinois, an Iraq war veteran.\nThe new Congress is among the most racially diverse in history, owing in large part to the minority party, which represents the majority of racial, gender and religious diversity.\nRepublicans hold a 52-48 edge over Democrats in the Senate and 241-194 advantage in the House.\n"

        "text": "\n1 | Remember deterring corruption is the best solution\nA few years ago, I advised the people behind the Trade Route Incident Mapping System (TRIMS) in Nigeria - a crowdsourced whistle blowing system which allowed truckers and small traders stuck at border check points (some real, some artificial, set up to harass and extort bribes) to report corrupt officials using a mobile phone. There may have been no direct link to officials being punished, but there were stories of a deterrent effect: some truckers mentioned TRIMS and they were let go without being harassed for bribes. Hari Mulukutla, managing director, Stream House, New York, United States\n2 | Use technological tools to develop institutional trust\nMy observations in an east African country recently were that despite decent anti-corruption institutions, an active civil society and a relatively free press, corruption seemed to be ingrained. Leadership in government, media and NGOs seemed cynical. One of my recommendations was to use secure case management systems with audit trails and secure workspaces so investigators can trust these tools and that their work won’t be undermined or leaked. Hari Mulukutla\n3| Automate tax collection\n\n\n\n\nIs fighting corruption like fighting zombies?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAutomation is playing an important contribution to reducing discretionary practices in tax collection. Taxpayers hoping to pay less and tax administrators hoping to earn more can easily lead to bribery and corruption in the tax office. In Afghanistan, we implemented an automated tax administration system that moved taxpayer information from being hidden in a desk drawer to being recorded electronically and only accessed by the people who need it. This helped reduce opportunities for corruption, built public trust in the tax system, and increased revenue collection from $250m to almost $2bn since 2004. Iker Lekuona, senior manager, Adam Smith International, Kampala, Uganda @AdamSmithInt\n4 | Share information across borders\nCorruption doesn’t stop at national borders. Sharing information internationally on aid, public contracts, or company ownership, for example through a public registry of beneficial owners, can be really powerful to compare, identify, and prosecute. Agreeing an open data standard also reduces discussions on which information should be public and this being different in different countries. In Ukraine, implementing the standard has led to 14% in savings. Georg Neumann, senior manager, Open Contracting Partnership, Washington DC, USA @georg_neu @opencontracting\n5 | Digitise public services\nDue to the fact that there is a 40% unemployment rate in Kosovo, recruitment is very often prone to bribes. One way we are helping local governments to prevent corrupt practices by public service personnel is to put their entire recruitment process online. We’ve also used social innovation challenges and hackathons to build tools that show budget expenditures in real time. Shqipe Neziri Vela, manager of the Anti-Corruption Programme at UNDP Kosovo, Prishtina, Kosovo @Shqipe_Neziri @UNDP_Kosovo\n6 | Take inspiration from other initiatives around the world\nFrom a UK point of view, I think the OCCRP, OpenCorporates and mySociety really stand out as organisations who’ve used technology to prevent, detect and deter corruption. OpenCorporates, for example, pulled together a global register of companies, and partnered with Global Witness to do some great research into corruption in the jade trade in Myanmar. Steve Goodrich, senior researcher, Transparency International UK, London, UK @SteveJGoodrich @TransparencyUK\n7 | Pay attention to local contexts \n\n\n\n\nAnti-corruption protests around the world - in pictures\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplicability is a tricky issue. I think mySociety and Fundación Ciudadano Inteligente have done a great job at creating tools that are easily adjustable to local contexts because they are very specific. The risk is sometimes with tools like Ushahidi that provide a great technology, but when implemented locally, people’s motivation for why they would or wouldn’t use the service is overlooked. Georg Neumann\n8 | Be aware using technology to fight corruption is not risk free\nIn countries where the state tightly controls the internet and other communication networks, it is possible that some governments could try to block or censor anti-corruption campaigns, particularly as many corrupt acts are often committed by state actors. Kwami Ahiabenu II, executive director, Penplusbytes, Accra, Ghana @kwamigh @penplusbytes\n9 | And remember technology doesn’t always democratise access\nIn India, in order to access subsidised fertilisers and seeds farmers have to submit their land registration certificates which they have to obtain from the land registration department, providing ample opportunities for corrupt officers. The government of Karnataka initiated a project called ‘Bhoomi’ where technology was used to load all details about land ownership and copies of these documents could be obtained though an IT booth. However, lack of literacy meant that middlemen were still able to use the vulnerabilities of the service seeker to demand money.

        "text": "\nThe Serious Fraud Office has opened a formal criminal investigation into allegations of bribery and corruption at aircraft engine maker Rolls-Royce.\nThe aerospace and defence company has been under the spotlight since late 2012, when the company said the SFO had approached it about allegations of malpractice in Indonesia and China, prompting Rolls-Royce to commission an independent investigation that turned up \"matters of concern\".\nDetails of the allegations soon broke into the open through a whistleblower, who claimed that the world's second largest jet engine manufacturer had bribed Tommy Suharto, son of Indonesia's former president General Suharto, with $20m (£13m) and a blue Rolls-Royce car.\nThe SFO said on Monday that its director, David Green, had decided to step up its probe and had \"opened a criminal investigation into allegations of bribery and corruption at Rolls-Royce\". The move comes in the same month that the SFO suffered another reversal, following a number of failed inquiries and trials, when it abandoned the corruption trial of British-Canadian billionaire Victor Dahdaleh.\nThe Suharto allegations were made by former Rolls-Royce employee Dick Taylor in a series of online comments. The Derby-based company is accused of paying bribes in the 1980s and 1990s in order to persuade the national airline, Garuda, to order Rolls-Royce Trent 700 engines.\nLawyers for Suharto, who was convicted of ordering the murder of a judge who tried him on separate corruption charges in 2000, said: \"He [Suharto] did not, and has never, received monies or a car from Rolls-Royce and nor did he recommend their engines to Garuda, as alleged.\"\nTaylor, who worked for Rolls for more than 30 years, including a stint in Indonesia, turned whistleblower after the company ignored concerns he raised internally.\nAfter taking early retirement, Taylor said he decided to \"tell the truth\", and since 2006 has been posting comments below Rolls-Royce articles on newspaper websites around the world, including the Guardian's website.\nRolls-Royce appointed law firm Debevoise & Plimpton to investigate allegations made by Taylor that the company maintained a \"secret slush fund\". The inquiry uncovered concerns about the company's dealings in China, which have been passed to the SFO.\nIn order to demonstrate that it took the allegations seriously, in January Rolls-Royce appointed Lord Gold, a former City lawyer and Tory party peer, to review its anti-bribery and compliance procedures. He has yet to formally report back to the company's board.\nIn a statement on Monday Rolls-Royce said: \"Further to our announcement of 6 December 2012 relating to concerns about bribery and corruption in overseas markets, we have been informed by the Serious Fraud Office that it has now commenced a formal investigation into these matters.\"\nThe SFO said the timing of the release two days before Christmas was decided by Rolls-Royce, not the agency.\nIt has been reported that the company had been trying to avoid a formal SFO investigation by offering to pay a multimillion-pound fine.\nAn investigation could prove embarrassing for the prime minister and royal family, who have spoken of their pride in one of Britain's best-known companies.\nDavid Cameron has praised Rolls as an enterprise \"of which the whole country can be proud\", and the Duke of Cambridge has described it as \"one of the United Kingdom's great global companies\".\nLast year, Rolls-Royce's chief executive, John Rishton, stressed that the company would not tolerate illegal conduct. He said: \"I want to make it crystal clear that neither I nor the board will tolerate improper business conduct of any sort and will take all necessary action to ensure compliance.\"\nEarlier this year, Mark King, head of Rolls's aerospace division, resigned just four months after being promoted to president of aerospace, the division beset by the allegations.\nRolls did not explain why King, a 27-year company veteran, was leaving. The company refused to state whether his departure was linked to the investigation, stating only that he was leaving for \"personal reasons\".\nNick Cunningham, an analyst at Agency Partners, said the criminal investigation \"can be very serious for individuals involved and they tend to result in cultural change in companies. If you look at the financial cost of the fines, they are rarely very large.\" He said that even if Rolls were found guilty it would \"have very little impact\" on the company's financial performance.\nBarry Vitou, partner and white-collar crime expert at law firm Pinsent Masons, said: \"The SFO are making good on threats to investigate allegations of serious fraud. The Rolls-Royce story has been in the news for over a year but the news that the SFO has formally opened an investigation underscores its resolve to actively take on big cases. Businesses should take note: the SFO will be keen to deliver results after recent losses.\"\n"

        "text": "\nA US court will hear arguments on Thursday that oil giant Petrobras should stand trial for a culture of bribery and corruption that has rocked Brazilian businesses and political elite and lowered the company’s value by $90bn.\nInvestors, led by the UK Universities Superannuation Scheme, which manages the pension funds of British academics, claim they lost billions as a result of the huge money laundering and corruption scheme. The investors, which also include the retirement funds of state workers in Ohio, Idaho and Hawaii, claim in court filings that Petrobras was “rotten to the core”.\nThe scandal, which has been dubbed “operation carwash” because huge amounts of money were allegedly laundered through a money exchange in a nondescript gas station in the Brazilian capital, has already led to the indictment of more than 40 Brazilian executives allegedly involved in the bribery scheme dating back to 2006.\nCorruption allegedly spread from the boardroom to politics, with Brazilians taking to the streets earlier this year to call for the impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff. She was chairwoman of Petrobras’s board between 2003 and 2010, when most of the alleged corruption took place. Rousseff has denied any knowledge of the scheme and no evidence has linked her to the corruption.\nThe Brazilian government owns the majority of Petrobras’ shares, and controls the company with seven of 10 seats on the board.\nThe lawsuit claims that Petrobras executives accepted bribes for inflating the value of construction contracts and “used the money to bribe politicians through intermediaries to guarantee they would vote in line with the ruling party while enriching themselves.” \nThe investors in the US class action, which merges eight separate suits, are being represented by Pomerantz Law, which helped investors sue BP in the wake of the Gulf of Mexico disaster and some of those that lost out in the Enron scandal. \nPetrobras has called for the case to be thrown out because the company was also a victim of the scheme. “Petrobras itself was the victim in this scandal, carried out by a criminal cartel of Brazil’s largest construction and engineering companies,” the company said in papers filed at the district court in lower Manhattan. \nIf Judge Rakoff, who is known for his tough stance on corporate wrongdoing, allows the case to go ahead, senior executives and Brazilian politicians will likely be called to appear before the New York court. \nMeanwhile, Brazilian prosecutors investigating the scandal have asked the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to help them build their case as its tentacles spread beyond the board. \nIn a statement, this week, prosecutors said they had been “inspired by the Fifa case”, in which the US brought bribery and corruption charges against several senior executives in world soccer. \n"

        "text": "\nHow does a council bounce back after its mayor is ousted from office? In the wake of Lutfur Rahman being found guilty of multiple corruption allegations by the high court, we look at what this means for the future of Tower Hamlets – and Rahman himself.\nWho is in charge in Tower Hamlets now?\nWith the 2014 election declared void, the east London borough is preparing for a rerun of the election on 11 June, with deputy mayor Oliur Rahman (no relation) assuming responsibility until then.\nWhat control does the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) retain in Tower Hamlets?\n\n\n\n\nMet considers criminal inquiry into Tower Hamlets mayor Lutfur Rahman\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing an independent report that uncovered malpractice within the council, communities secretary Eric Pickles announced he was sending commissioners into Tower Hamlets to intervene. Since then the commissioners – led by Sir Ken Knight, the former London fire commissioner, and former council chief executive Max Caller – took control of grant-making decisions within the council. They also took charge of approving any sale or disposal of property and agreed a plan for publicity after independent inspectors PricewaterhouseCoopers concluded the borough was failing to provide value for money. DCLG is unable to comment on how much longer it will retain this control.\nWhat will happen to the decisions Rahman made during his time in office?\nThey will still stand, including those relating to the mayor’s education awards as well as key areas such as housing, education, the environment and health and wellbeing.\nA spokesperson for the council said: “The provision of grants to third-sector groups also continues, under the management of government-appointed commissioners. All services delivered by the council to local residents, schools and businesses will also continue as usual.”\nWho is standing for the new mayoral election?\nLabour have selected John Biggs as their candidate. In the first round of last year’s election he was a close second to Lutfur, receiving 32.8% of the vote compared to Rahman’s 43%.\n\n\n\n\nLeader of legal fight against Tower Hamlets mayor to run for office\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAndy Erlam, a member of the Red Flag anti-corruption party, is also running. Erlam is a writer and filmmaker who led the group that successfully sought legal action against Rahman. “Many people have asked me to stand,” he said. “It’s the chance in our lifetimes to change everything for the better.”\nA candidate for the Conservative party is yet to be announced. Christopher Wilford, who stood in the 2014 election and received 8.5% of the vote, is currently standing for election to become the MP for Poplar and Limehouse so will not be re-entering the mayoral election.\nWhat will Rahman do now?\nThe High Court ordered that Rahman be banned from office for five years, so his future prospects in politics look bleak. Electoral commissioner Richard Mawrey did not hold back in shaming a man whom he labelled an “evasive witness” who used the race card to intimidate and stifle dissent.\nHowever, on 27 April a statement on Rahman’s website revealed he would be appealing the high court ruling, which, if successful, would overturn the ban. The website also launched a petition for his supporters to sign. It is not clear what Rahman plans to do in the next five years if the ban goes ahead, nor is he commenting on whether he plans to return to office after the five years have passed.\nRahman was a family solicitor before leaving for a career in politics. The court has referred his case to the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA), which could meanhe is also barred from practising law. An SRA spokesperson said: “We are awaiting the referral from the court to assess the information it has before deciding on the appropriate course of action.”\nMeanwhile, the metropolitan police service is studying the 200-page report for evidence of criminality.\nHow will the ruling affect Rahman’s independent party, Tower Hamlets First (THF)?\nThe party did not come out well in the judge’s ruling. He said: “THF was the personal fiefdom of Mr Rahman. He directed its operations, he selected his candidates, and those candidates campaigned on the basis that their job, if elected, was to give personal support to him.”\nRahman’s key lieutenant, Alibor Choudhury, was also banned from being a councillor with immediate effect. Mawrey said he couldn’t ban other THF councillors from office as they were not named in the petition that started this case. Like the position of mayor, the councillor position for Stepney Green will remain vacant until 11 June.\nHow will Tower Hamlets ensure similar malpractice doesn’t happen again?\nThe Tower Hamlets council has made a concerted effort to distance itself from Rahman. A council spokesman said: “In the high court ruling, the practices of the council were declared sound. The court found that the problems that arose during Rahman’s mayorship were that of him and not the council’s practices. We have nothing to do with Rahman any more.”\nBut the council has also been hit by fresh corruption allegations, accused of overcharging homeowners for renovation work. The council denies malpractice. In a joint statement with Tower Hamlets Homes, which manages the council properties, the council said: “No fraudulent practice or irregularities were found during a comprehensive, independent audit this year, which reviewed the use of a Greater London Authority grant by the council for decent homes works.”\n• This article was amended on 29 April 2015 to make it clear that the council’s joint statement was with Tower Hamlets Homes, not the party Tower Hamlets First, as an earlier version said.\nSign up for your free weekly Guardian Public Leaders newsletter with news and analysis sent direct to you every Thursday.

        "text": "\nWhen Sir John Rose stepped down as chief executive of Rolls-Royce in March 2011, the company had been transformed.\nThe so-called “Lion of Rolls-Royce” had been in charge for 15 years and overseen the expansion of one of Britain’s best-known blue-chip companies into an engineering giant on the world stage.\nThe firm that had made engines for Spitfires during the second world war had become a £13bn leviathan. Yet, cracks in its carefully crafted corporate image were about to emerge.\nExactly how it started is still unclear, but by December 2012, Rolls-Royce had put itself on red alert. It acknowledged, somewhat opaquely, that it had a problem – and the Serious Fraud Office said it was investigating.\nAt first, the SFO focused on the company’s activities in the emerging markets of India and China, but the list of jurisdictions was to grow.\nBefore long, the SFO declared it had opened a criminal investigation into allegations of bribery and corruption at Rolls-Royce.\n\n\n\n\nRolls-Royce middlemen may have used bribes to land major contracts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn an unusual move, the company, which had conducted its own internal review of its business, made clear the seriousness of the situation. “It is too early to predict the outcomes, but these could include the prosecution of individuals and of the company. We will cooperate fully,” Rolls-Royce said.\nIn an effort to get ahead of the problem, but in a way that underlined its predicament, the company appointed Lord Gold, a former head of litigation at City law firm Herbert Smith, to review Rolls-Royce’s “compliance procedures”.\nFour years since the first reports of potential problems, and three years since the SFO began its inquiry in earnest, the scale of the investigation has become apparent.\nThe Guardian has established the SFO team is now 30-strong, and is being supported by so-called “blockbuster funding” – money from the Treasury to cover exceptional costs.\n“It soon became clear that it was multiple jurisdictions, across several strands of its business,” said a source with knowledge of the inquiry.\nSo what has happened in the past three years?\nThe SFO has given little away and has only confirmed making two arrests. They happened in February 2014, when it emerged that two businessmen Sudhir Choudhrie and his son Bhanu were questioned as part of its wide-ranging investigation into the activities of Rolls-Royce.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Rolls-Royce staff working on the BR725 engine. Photograph: Rolls-Royce Deutschland/Rolls-Royce plc\n\n\nNeither has been charged and a few months after the arrests, the two men had their bail conditions lifted, but the Guardian understands the SFO’s inquiries are continuing.\nThe early focus on the Choudhries has been intriguing – their lawyers said they had not and have never been middlemen for Rolls-Royce, nor paid bribes to government officials or acted as middlemen in defence deals.\nIn short, they say they have done nothing wrong.\nSo who are they? The Choudhries are among the wealthiest and best-known families in India. They have a wide range of business interests and have become familiar faces in political circles in the UK too.\nThey are entrepreneurs and philanthropists, and have also been major donors to the Liberal Democrats. They and their extended families own a number of mansions in the heart of London’s Belgravia.\nWith such a high profile, they have not avoided scrutiny – or criticism. \n\n\n\n\nThe 12 countries where suspicious activity linked to Rolls-Royce has been identified\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn India, for instance, Sudhir Choudhrie was investigated in 2004 by India’s Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) – the country’s foremost law enforcement agency – over suspicions related to alleged payoffs to a company agent.\nYears later the investigation was dropped, with Choudhrie insisting he had been a victim of a plot to damage his reputation. His lawyers told the Guardian: “Sudhir Choudhrie was investigated but was never arrested. He was subsequently cleared of all allegations of wrongdoing and the investigation as a whole was closed in 2011.”\nIn a closure report filed in a Delhi court that year, the CBI stated it did not find any evidence to suggest there was any payoff to Choudhrie or his companies. \nA list compiled and disseminated by the CBI names Sudhir Choudhrie as one of 23 “unscrupulous persons” on a list of “undesirable contact men”. The list, which has been seen by the Guardian, is undated but is understood to still be in circulation in the Indian government. Choudhrie has challenged its authenticity. His lawyers say that although he has been made aware of it, he has no knowledge of its content and has never been contacted about it by any official body. \nSeparately from their alleged interaction with Rolls-Royce, there have been other occasions when the family’s finances have raised concerns.\nOne Swiss banking source has described to the Guardian and BBC how money transfers between the Choudhrie family group’s companies sparked an anti-money laundering alert at Clariden Leu, which was then a private banking division of Credit Suisse.\nThe Guardian has seen a report created by the risk management team at Clariden Leu in October 2008, which highlights the flow of vast sums that triggered the inquiry.\nThe report analysed 18 “account relationships” and looked at money transfers between companies owned or managed by members of Bhanu Choudhrie’s extended family. One was Belinea Services Limited, which received €37,200,000 (£33,400,000) from Rosoboronexport State Corporation, the Russian state’s arms dealership. Bhanu Choudhrie was a director of Belinea.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Visitors at the Rosoboronexport stand at the 2015 Dubai Airshow. Photograph: TASS / Barcroft Media\n\n\nIn the year leading up to the report, another company, the Seychelles-registered Cottage Consultants, received €28,100,000 from Rosoboronexport and transferred €22,700,000 to an Isle of Man bank.\nOn company documents, Bhanu Choudhrie is described as the “first and sole director” of Cottage Consultants. The company is owned through bearer shares, which means it is owned by whoever physically holds the share certificates. Bhanu Choudhrie has denied being a beneficial owner of the company. \nCottage Consultants had also received €9,700,000 from an entity called “ABC”, with the money originating from Vnesheconombank, a now-sanctioned Moscow bank.\n \nThe Guardian asked Bhanu Choudhrie about the transfers that had alerted Clariden Leu. His lawyers said he had no knowledge of the internal report and any suggestion that these payments were improper or illegal was false and defamatory.\nThe twists and turns of the Choudhries’ business empire have rarely been out of the news in recent years, but it is their apparent knowledge of the bureaucracy and red tape in their home country – and how best to navigate it – that might make them seem ideal middlemen for any company hoping to break into the lucrative Indian market. One such firm is alleged to have been Rolls-Royce.\nThe firm was involved in the the massive – and massively complicated – Hawk deal, which involved India buying Rolls-Royce engines and BAE-produced planes.\nA first tranche of this was agreed in 2004, a second in 2010. The total value of all the contracts involved came to £2.1bn.\n\n\n\n\nWhy the Rolls-Royce investigation is so important to the SFO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe parts were assembled at Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, an Indian state-owned aerospace and defence firm, where Sudhir Choudhrie’s uncle had been the chairman.\nThe Guardian has spoken to one Rolls-Royce source. The source said the Choudhries and their companies had worked with the firm during this period.\n“You had to work your way and it took time,” said the Rolls-Royce source. “We needed to have Indian partners or a sister company in India.”\nThe source said local fixers would help arrange the deal, before senior Rolls-Royce figures arrived to complete it. \nThe Guardian and the BBC understand that millions of pounds of Rolls-Royce money went to the Choudhrie family. \nEven if this were true, it does not mean there has been any wrongdoing. Using middlemen is not illegal, so long as they abide by the rules.\nThe Guardian asked the Choudhries to explain what role, if any, they – or their companies – had played in the Hawk deals. Lawyers for the Choudhries said they had not been middlemen or intermediaries and that any allegation that Rolls-Royce had paid them for the purpose of securing deals in India was untrue.\nThe Guardian has been told about a curious meeting between Bhanu Choudhrie and a British businessman. \nIt came from a banking source who spoke to the Guardian. The source alleged that Bhanu Choudhrie and a former BAE executive called Peter Ginger visited Geneva together in 2007. Ginger was BAE’s president in India until 2005.\nThe Guardian has been told that during this trip, Ginger allegedly deposited hundreds of thousands of pounds in cash into a Clariden Leu account from another account he held. \nBy 2009, the account, which was called No 120467 Portsmouth, held about 1m Swiss francs.\nThe Guardian has seen a copy of a bank document that shows the details of the Portsmouth account.\nSeparately, documents discovered among the Panama Papers – the investigation into the Mossack Fonseca law firm carried out by the Guardian, the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and Süddeutsche Zeitung – also reveal the family of Peter Ginger asking for a payment from an educational foundation with an apparent link to Bhanu Choudhrie.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  The Mossack Fonseca law firm sign in Panama City. Photograph: Carlos Jasso / Reuters/Reuters\n\n\nAn email seen by the Guardian shows the Panamanian foundation paid to cover the university costs of one of Ginger’s relatives. In one email, a member of the family requested money from the foundation to pay an allowance. “[…] is now back in [university ] for the summer term so we would be most grateful for payment to the same account as before,” he wrote.\nHe added: “I hope this is in order and meets with [the] foundation council’s approval. Please don’t hesitate to contact me or […] if you have any questions.”\nThe payment was for £540 for four weeks of “food and subsistence”.\nWe asked Ginger and Choudrie to explain these apparent interactions. Is there a benign explanation? Could the banking source in Geneva have got it wrong? Lawyers for Bhanu Choudhrie insist he has. “Our client has no knowledge of what bank accounts have been set up or operated by Mr Ginger or what sums (if any) he has deposited in them in cash. Mr Choudhrie did not pay any bribe to Mr Ginger.”\nThey added: “Our client has no knowledge of any payments made [by the Foundation].”\nThe Guardian asked Ginger why he visited Geneva with Bhanu Choudhrie, and why the Panamanian foundation was funding his relative’s education. He declined to comment on the allegations: “I am not prepared to talk about it at all. I’m not going to respond to the media at all.”\nBAE Systems said it had “no record indicating that Mr Ginger had a personal financial relationship with Mr Choudhrie during the period that Mr Ginger was employed by the Company”.\nThe episode may be nothing more than an intriguing vignette, but the SFO may have an opportunity to judge for itself. The source, who asked not to be named, has offered to speak to the SFO’s investigators.\nThe Choudhries had to wait seven years to be cleared after Indian authorities launched an inquiry – the SFO has been looking at them, and at Rolls-Royce, for a mere three. And the investigation appears to be broadening even now.\n\nPanorama: Rolls-Royce will be broadcast on BBC1 at 8.30pm on Monday 31 October.\n\n\nIf you would like to pass on any confidential information, you can send a message via the Guardian’s SecureDrop service (see how here and here). \n\n"

        "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/siemens-solmssen-bribery-corruption",
        "text": "\nWhere might businesses make the biggest impact on sustainability? Traditional answers might be fuel consumption and carbon emissions, resource efficiency and waste management. But Peter Y. Solmssen, general counsel for Siemens AG, argues for a broader view of sustainability as something that underlies every aspect of global business culture.\n\"Sustainability involves more than climate change and the environment,\" Solmssen says. \"Sustainability is about survival. It means clean water and clean air, but it also means having an economic system that works for everyone. It means having responsible citizens, both corporate and individual.\"\nA key part of this culture of responsibility, Solmssen claims, is a global business environment that actively fights corruption and bribery. \"There's no point in subsidizing any particular effort to restrict clean water, clean air or energy production in countries which are beset with corruption,\" Solmssen says. \"The money will end up in numbered bank accounts in Switzerland. It won't go where it's supposed to go.\" \nSiemens is well versed in the high cost of corruption: in 2008, following a string of high-profile bribery scandals, it agreed to a record $1.6bn legal settlement with American and European authorities. Solmssen, in fact, was part of the group Siemens CEO Peter Löscher brought in to help clean up the company's institutional culture. \nLöscher's team quickly went to work. In an article for the Harvard Business Review, Löscher explained how – in a few months – the company cleaned house, replacing 80% of its top-tier executives, 70% of its second tier and 40% of its third tier. \nBut Siemens' culture of corruption extended far beyond the executive suite. As one German investigator later put it, \"bribery was Siemens' business model\". In fact, the company even had a handy accounting euphemism for its bribes: \"nützliche Aufwendungen,\" or \"useful money\".\nGiven the corruption that permeated Siemens, it was clear that Löscher's team needed to fundamentally change the culture of the firm. The trouble was, the employees who knew the most about the company's bribery culture and methods were the same ones who were actually involved in it. Changing Siemens' way of doing business would require enlisting help from the very employees who had the most to lose. \nLöscher offered his workers a deal: He promised that anyone who came forward to admit their involvement in bribery would get full amnesty. Not only wouldn't they be fired, but the company promised to help with any legal problems stemming from these admissions. On the other hand, those employees who didn't come forward, but were later found guilty of bribery, would be fired. Solmssen estimates that \"about 130\" employees came forward to admit their role in bribery and to explain where the money had gone. \nAccording to Solmssen, Siemens' anti-corruption efforts have come with minimal cost. In fact, he claims, the company's bottom line has only grown. \"That's the important lesson from our case,\" he says. \"There is no tradeoff. Clean business is good business.\" Siemens' 2012 annual report, which shows steady year-over-year revenue growth between 2010 and 2012, bears this out.\nSiemens' internal efforts notwithstanding, Solmssen is quick to point out that corruption is a global problem – and one that requires a global solution. \"First you need an internal, leadership commitment to compliance,\" he says. \"Then you can organize concerted, collective action among other companies in your markets.\" \nCollaborating for change\nBut Solmssen is convinced that the groundwork for industry-wide cooperation already exists. Speaking of General Electric, where he previously worked, Solmssen notes that, although his old company and Siemens \"compete vigorously all around the world,\" they have a deep well of shared values. \"We cooperate on many fronts, such as the fight against corruption,\" he explains. \"We cooperate on standard setting, even while we're competing commercially.\"\nThis sort of cooperation can lead to significant change, he says: \"If we, the major companies and, really, anyone in private industry, link arms, we can drive corruption out of our markets. I call it the Cartel of the Good. If we cooperate, then there is no bribery.\" \nUnsurprisingly, the fight against corruption also extends beyond the business community and into the realm of international governance. \"It is principle 10 of the UN Global Compact,\" Solmssen notes.\nLater this week, he will address global business cooperation at the UN Global Compact Leaders Summit, which he says itself is \"an example of good companies combining to make their environments better\".\nDespite the success of Siemens' anti-bribery efforts, Solmssen is quick to note that the problem still exists. The bribery-related fallout – and court proceedings – continues. \n\"It's a constant struggle,\" he notes. \"The bad guys are clever. You close one door and they try to get through another.\" The answer, it seems, is to make sure that the doors are closed to bribery and corruption, not only at one company, but across the globe.\n"

        "text": "\nWhile much of southern Australia shivered through some of the lowest temperatures in recent years, Megan Brennan wandered along Darwin’s Mindil Beach under a blazing sun, examining boats built from empty beer cans and checking the crews had crocodile repellant in their safety kit.\nBrennan and her fellow Lions Club judges stopped to laugh at one entrant of the annual Beer Can Regatta. Just in case it helped the judging process, the crew had left a pile of fake cash sitting on their boat.\n\n\n\n\n \n\nWe’re open to bribery and corruption.\n\n\n“We look at construction, how well it’s made, are the crews in T-shirts, do they look like a team,” Brennan told Guardian Australia. “We go through, the four of us judges, and check all of them out then sit down cross legged together and check the points. We’re also open to bribery and corruption – but we won’t tell anyone that,” she laughed.\nBrennan and her fellow judges had examined half a dozen or so entrants, some looking more seaworthy than others. She questioned the captain of the bribery boat about his safety equipment: lifejackets, paddles and the like.\n“What else have you got in the way of survival equipment?” she asked.\n“Legs. Arms,” he replied.\nBrennan mused for a moment, then looked back at the captain. “Have you got crocodile repellant?”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Darwin’s Beer Can Regatta has been dealing with piracy for years. Photograph: Helen Davidson for the Guardian\n\n\nThe Beer Can Regatta has been going since 1974, and has evolved over that period into the safer, more sober and family-friendly event it is now. \nA 1980s change by beer companies from steel to aluminium cans had consequences they probably did not account for. The newer, lighter cans can be crushed at 28 knots, the Lions Club discovered, so outboard motors and power boats were banned.\nDarwin LGBTIQ get inspiration from Cher\nOn Sunday Shay Whiticker was up early to get to Bunnings for some last minute supplies to finish off Rainbow Territory’s boat. Entering the regatta was an inspired decision by the member of Darwin’s LGBTIQ advocacy group.\n\n\n\n\nNorthern Territory in a day: excess, destruction, beauty and recklessness\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“I was watering my lawn one afternoon, and threw my beer can, but I missed the bin and when it hit the ground the sun glistened on it and all of a sudden I hear this sound: ‘If you build it Cher will come,’” Whiticker told Guardian Australia. \n“So I went to my local Rainbow Territory and they all looked at me with a bit of wonder, but one mate stood up and said ‘I will help you build it.’ And that’s how the boat came along.”\n \nThe boats vary in quality. Some extremely seaworthy-looking vessels took thousands of cans and many months to build. Others could have been cobbled together that morning from the leftovers of a larger than expected Saturday night.\nThe captain of a “croc-amaran” did some hasty duct tape repairs in the middle of a television interview. An otherwise impressive looking boat by a team from a local Amcal Chemist lost its hulls as soon as they picked it up. A dinghy helmed by Free West Papua activists had some cans half-heartedly strung over the bow, but mainly the crew just wanted to fly the morningstar flag.\nAbout 15,000 people turn up every year to check out the vessels, take part in races and competitions and stroll around the market.\nTen can-mandments keep things under control\nThe main event – when the boats take to the water in various competitions – fills the afternoon. The competitions are governed by the “Ten can-mandments”.\n\n\n\n\n \n\nThe most important rule is to get out there and have fun.\n\n\n\nThou shalt enter the event in the right spirit.\nThou shalt build the craft of cans.\nThe craft shall float by cans alone.\nThou shalt not drown.\nThou shalt not take the name of the craft in vain: any craft bearing signs or lettering that may be offensive will be barred.\nThou shalt not drift from the straight and narrow and end up at Mandorah.\nThou shalt not protest too much.\nThou shall honour thy Committee.\nThou shalt not commit adultery – nothing really to do with the Regatta, but it gives us an air of responsibility and respect.\nThou shalt go back and read the first can-mandment again.\n\n“The ten can-mandments are absolutely vital,” said Brennan. “But the most important rule is to get out there and have fun.”\nThis year’s regatta took place the same weekend tens of thousands of Australian, US and Japanese troops conducted the Talisman Sabre joint military exercise, also in Darwin. But despite the large warships moored off the coast, the real battle was at Mindil.\nArmed with water pistols, flour bombs and water balloons, boat crews took to the sea – but they had begun on the wrong horn, thanks to an exuberant crowdmember, and organisers spent half an hour coaxing them back to shore.\nThe delay was not an issue – the timetable had already been abandoned due to over-enthusiasm at the thong throwing competition. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Tipanic, unlike its near namesake, did not sink. Photograph: Helen Davidson for the Guardian\n\n\nThe boats retook their positions, some limping after the false start, and then, with the real starting horn, they were off: a race to the floating buoys which indicated submerged treasure. The booty had to be captured and returned to the organisers’ tent without being pirated to claim the $500 prize money. \nTipanic, built by a team of engineers from several thousand cans and some very structurally sound framing, was a clear contender for the title. Flour flew, crew members leaped from boat to boat, and splashing oars and pistols dampened already soaked enemies.\nThe engineers were declared winners, despite strong looting attempts by rivals. Wreckage, both boat and human, lumbered to shore. Discarded cans were collected and the crowds dwindled. Some took the opportunity for a swim, confident the crocs would have been scared off by all the activity. Tipanic’s team celebrated victory, but the win came at a cost, and what was left of their once glorious ship was unceremoniously loaded onto the back of a flatbed truck and driven away, never to see battle again.\n"

        "text": "\nWhen João Havelange was elected president of Fifa, football’s world governing body, in 1974, he announced: “I have come to change entirely the way Fifa works. I have come to sell a product called football.” Judged on those criteria, his 24 years in office were more successful than even he – a man of unshakeable self-belief – could have foreseen.\n\n\n\n\nJoão Havelange, president of Fifa from 1974 to 1998, dies aged 100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHavelange, who has died aged 100, increased the revenue of global football and modernised the game, launching a wave of new tournaments, including world championships at under-17 and under-20 level, the Confederations Cup and the Women’s World Cup. He expanded the World Cup finals from a 16-nation to 24-nation and then 32-nation competition, invited almost all the countries in the world to join Fifa, and offered them increased involvement in it. By the time he left office in 1998, the organisation had more members than the UN.\nHe was the first sports administrator to pursue global sponsors, such as Adidas and Coca-Cola, and gain total control of television rights and advertising, through his links with the now discredited and defunct sports marketing company ISL. The revolutionary lobbying and business techniques he used to win votes and contracts are now employed routinely.\nAnd yet, to his many critics, Havelange’s zeal for commercialising football resulted in it losing its soul. There was rarely any evidence of his love for the game – the players, countries and hundreds of millions of fans to whom the game brings such joy seemed but parts of his money-spinning masterplan. Worse still, his administrative era was severely tainted by allegations of bribery and corruption, which intensified under the man he pushed forward to be his anointed successor, Sepp Blatter.\nHavelange was born in Rio de Janeiro to Belgian parents. His father was an arms trader who sent his son to school in France, and the family spoke French at home. Havelange played football as a youth but it was swimming at which he excelled, and he represented Brazil at the Berlin Olympics in 1936 (the year in which he also earned a law degree). He won a bronze medal for water polo at the Pan American Games in 1951, and represented Brazil in the sport at the Helsinki Olympics in 1952.\nHe made his fortune building up Cometa, a transport businesses, but it was as a sports administrator that Havelange made his name. He led the Brazilian delegation to the Melbourne Olympics in 1956 and became a member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1963. In 1958 he was appointed head of the CBD, the Brazilian Sports Confederation, which oversaw all the nation’s sports.\nThe appointment was made six months before Brazil won their first World Cup, in Sweden, and coincided with a golden era of Brazilian football as they went on to win the tournament again in Chile in 1962 and Mexico in 1970. The 1958 and 1970 teams included a galaxy of stars, among them Pelé, who would become an important figure in Havelange’s quest for power.\nHis role in funding and organising Brazil’s World Cup victories was important, if typically autocratic. In 1958 he included a psychologist in the party (fearing some players were still affected by the trauma of 1950, when Brazil lost in the final at home in Rio, in front of 200,000 people), and wanted to impose concentração total on the squad, effectively round-the-clock supervision, believing that football was too important to be left to the footballers.\nBy the late 1960s Brazil was entering the most brutal phase of a 20-year military dictatorship and Havelange appeased the generals by sacking the coach, João Saldanha, a member of the Brazilian Communist party, in 1969. He also instigated a three-month pre-tournament training camp for the squad. They won the 1970 World Cup playing some of the best football ever seen, but they arrived in Mexico wearing dark green, military-style suits.\nIn 1969, with an eye on the Fifa votes of African football federations, he organised a tour of the continent for Pelé’s club, Santos. It was Havelange who circulated the story that the opposing sides in the Biafran civil war in Nigeria declared a two-day truce so they could watch Pelé play. Years later, Pelé claimed the story was exaggerated. There was the chance for more lobbying in 1972 when Havelange invited 20 countries to Brazil, all expenses paid, to play in an unrecognised football tournament, the Brazil Independence Cup.\nBy the time of the 1974 election for Fifa president, Havelange had spent millions touring the world lobbying for votes, often accompanied by Pelé. He reckoned he had visited 86 countries in 10 weeks in the runup to the election.\nHis strategy was to attack the European dominance of Fifa while promising developing countries a greater role, money for their football infrastructure and an expanded World Cup. He paid for many poorer African delegates, who otherwise rarely bothered to turn up at such meetings, to attend for the vote. Despite the enormous global success of the 1970 World Cup, broadcast for the first time in colour, the incumbent Fifa president, Sir Stanley Rous, was hanging on to amateur traditions and supported apartheid in South African sport. He was an easy opponent for Havelange to outmanoeuvre.\nAccording to Patrick Nally, a pioneer of modern sports marketing who played a key role in the victory, interviewed by the journalist Andrew Jennings for Dishonored Games (1992): “Havelange had seen the future … He knew that if he became the president of the only federation already running its own high-profile world championship, then he would enjoy huge economic power.”\nHavelange had relatively little influence on his first World Cup as Fifa president, held in Argentina, then ruled by a military junta. He let the generals and the head of the Argentinian organising committee, Vice-Admiral Carlos Lacoste, run it their way. In the semi-final stage, Argentina beat Peru 6-0, one of the most controversial results in the history of the tournament.\nWhile that match was in progress, a bomb exploded at the home of the Argentinian finance secretary, Juan Alemann, who had criticised the organising committee for wasting millions of dollars on the World Cup. Alemann believed Lacoste had masterminded the operation. Two years later, Havelange appointed Lacoste a Fifa vice-president. When democratic rule was restored to Argentina in 1983, Lacoste was investigated for corruption.\nHavelange’s expansion of the World Cup began at the 1982 tournament in Spain, when the number of teams increased from 16 to 24. The following World Cup was scheduled to be held in Colombia, but when the country pulled out in financial difficulties, the US, Canada and Mexico put themselves forward to host it. In a show of strength that typified Havelange’s rule, every member of the Fifa executive committee voted with him in support of Mexico.\nMexico 1986 set a template for future World Cups – and was soon copied by other global sports federations. Havelange backed Mexico’s bid because of his close relationship with Guillermo Cañedo, a Fifa vice-president and Mexican media baron who brokered a lucrative global TV deal with ISL.\nThe founder of ISL was the German businessman Horst Dassler, former boss of Adidas, who, together with Havelange and the IOC chairman Juan Antonio Samaranch, were the most senior members of “the club”, an exclusive group of sports administrators and marketing men who controlled a large proportion of international sport. It was a cosy relationship, with the world’s two most powerful sporting bodies and the company that provided the lion’s share of their income all based in Switzerland.\nISL bought the rights to the World Cup for enormous sums, peaking in 1996 at the £1.45bn combined bid for rights to the 2002 and 2006 finals. The company folded in 2001, leaving debts of £153m and a trail of corruption that led to Fifa’s door. A Swiss court investigating the collapse, and the whereabouts of millions of missing dollars, heard evidence from a legal representative of Christoph Malms, a former ISL chief executive, that “the company became a private source of money for Fifa, virtually their private bank”.\nAfter two decades, Havelange’s Napoleonic rule began to stretch the patience of even loyal Fifa executives. He developed the habit of closing executive meetings by simply leaving the room and, in one famous case, postponing a discussion on Fifa appointments by handing out his own list of new committee members, then declaring the list passed without a vote.\nHe banned Pelé from attending the draw for the 1994 World Cup in Las Vegas after a feud involving Ricardo Teixeira, Havelange’s then son-in-law and president of the Brazilian Football Confederation. This behaviour towards Pelé would have raised eyebrows anywhere in the world. In the US, where he was the only soccer player known to many Americans, it was reckless.\nHavelange survived one more term as president, secured after further intensive lobbying and a promise to expand the World Cup from 24 to 32 teams for the 1998 tournament. Before resigning in 1998, he helped his righthand man, Blatter, to win the vote to succeed him, over the Uefa president, Lennart Johansson.\nIn 2011, Jennings told a Brazilian senate investigation that Havelange had received bribes totalling around $50m from ISL. Later that year the IOC ethics committee announced that it would investigate claims that he had received bribes of $1m. Soon afterwards, he resigned from the IOC for health reasons.\nIn April 2013 he resigned as honorary president of Fifa, again citing health reasons. Jennings led a BBC team for a Panorama programme in December 2015 that revealed the existence of a letter written by Havelange in 2010 claiming that disputed payments to him were above board and known to Blatter. An investigation by the FBI led to Blatter’s ejection from Fifa later that month.\nHavelange and his wife, Anna Maria (nee Hermanny), had a daughter, Lúcia, who was divorced from Teixeira in 1997, a granddaughter, Joana, director of the organising committee of the Brazil 2014 World Cup, and two grandsons, Ricardo and Roberto.\n• Jean-Marie Faustin Godefroid de Havelange, lawyer, sports administrator and businessman, born 8 May 1916; died 16 August 2016\n"

Preliminary results of autopsies completed by the Greene County medical examiner showed no signs of foul play, according to the local television station KY3. The causes of the deaths continue to be investigated and toxicology reports have been requested.\nA spokesman for ENRC Africa said: “It is with great sorrow that we were informed about the passing away of James Bethel and Gerrit Strydom. We can confirm that Gerrit Strydom was the general manager of the group’s CCC [Congo Cobalt Corp] operation in the DRC [Democratic Republic of the Congo]. We can also confirm that James Bethel was the head of copper cobalt in the DRC until 30 September 2014.\n“The two friends were travelling on holiday through the USA. We are awaiting further information regarding their deaths from the authorities in the USA.”\nENRC ended its controversial spell as a London-listed company in November 2013 when it was taken private by its three founders and the Kazakhstan government.\nIt had suffered from a series of corporate governance issues – which once saw the business labelled “more Soviet than City” – as well as numerous allegations of corruption. The claims prompted the Serious Fraud Office to launch an investigation in 2013, focusing on allegations of “fraud, bribery and corruption” in Kazakhstan and Africa. The company confirmed the investigation was still open.\nAfter floating ENRC on the London Stock Exchange in 2007, the company’s shares were quickly propelled into the FTSE 100 and, therefore, into many British pension funds.\nHowever, its persistent problems caused the share price to crash by 85%, prompting it to be taken private again by its three founders, Alexander Machkevitch, Patokh Chodiev and Alijan Ibragimov.\n"

And when he heard that one of the patients in his GP surgery might have a pair of tickets for the World Cup final, he was quickly on to it.

I still have the stub for mine: Empire Stadium Wembley, Jules Rimet Cup Final Tie, B Turnstiles, Entrance 24, East Standing Enclosure.\n\n\n\n\n1966 and all that – the best new football books\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby was the game at my grammar school, but I’d been obsessed with football since the age of 10 – went to Turf Moor to watch Burnley; created a pitch in rough ground at the back of our house where I could practise my ball skills; played midfield for a local youth team; attended trials, along with five others in that team, at Preston North End. My dad didn’t encourage my playing ambitions (professional football was no career for a middle-class boy) but nor could he dampen my enthusiasm. And when July 1966 came round, he too was caught up in the excitement.\nThe excitement was slower to build than it would be 30 years later, when England hosted the Euros. As every ageing pundit will tell you, things were different back then: not just the crowds (mostly standing) and the game (heavy ball, heavy tackling, no substitutes) but the structure of the tournament. Take the qualifiers. Then as now, both the hosts and current champions were given an automatic place in the finals. But the system by which the other 14 teams got there was bizarre. Some of the European groups consisted of four teams, others of three, and one had only Spain and the Republic of Ireland (they finished level on points and had to have a play-off in Paris). And whereas Europe was allowed eight qualifying groups (plus England), South America had just three (plus holders Brazil). The pro-European weighting looks even more marked if you consider Group 15, which consisted of nine teams split into three sub-groups – Mexico eventually emerged as winners, at the expense of teams such as Costa Rica, Honduras and the USA. With the whole of Africa boycotting the competition and several Asian teams withdrawing for economic reasons, the final qualifying group was made up of North Korea and Australia, with the former winning easily both home and away.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\nThe 1966 North Korea team were as much a mystery to westerners as the country is now. Like everyone else, I fell under their spell. After drawing with Chile and beating Italy, they went through to a quarter-final against Portugal – and took an implausible 3-0 lead. As I watched on telly, I began to feel sorry for Eusébio, who after the eclipse of Brazil’s Pelé (kicked to bits by opponents) was the tournament’s star player. The sympathy soon faded. Eusébio went on to score four goals in the 5-3 win. My abiding image of the match was of a North Korean player so worked up while waiting for a free-kick to be taken that he left his position in the defensive wall, ran forward to where the ball had been placed, and kicked it down the other end of the pitch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Portugal’s Eusébio during the semi-final against England. Photograph: Offside/Rex Features\n\n\nPortugal were England’s opponents in the semi-final. Till then, there’d been little to justify Alf Ramsey’s confidence that we’d win the World Cup: a boring goalless draw against Uruguay, a scrappy win against France (the decisive goal coming while a French player lay injured after a horrendous Nobby Stiles tackle), a 1-0 quarter-final win over the 10 men of Argentina (their star and captain, Antonio Rattín, having niggled and nattered his way to a red card). Only Bobby Charlton, with a glorious strike against Mexico, inspired hope. And it was his two goals against Eusébio’s one that won the match against Portugal, the second of them set up by Geoff Hurst, who some called a carthorse compared with Jimmy Greaves, but to whom Ramsey had taken a shine.\nEngland’s semi-final took place on the Tuesday evening. On the Thursday, we set off from Skipton to London – our first experience of the M1. My mother and sister came too: a long weekend would give us time to see the sights (most importantly, Carnaby Street). It’s a mystery how my dad got us two rooms at the Regent Palace Hotel near Piccadilly Circus, despite it being last-minute, and peak holiday season, and the World Cup final. But he did.\nI don’t remember much about the Saturday morning, apart from weeping with frustration as we sat in a cafe somewhere with my mother and sister, who were going to a matinee of Swan Lake. “You are advised to take up your position at least 30 minutes before kick-off,” it said on the back of my ticket, and there we were, miles away, with only three hours to go. We made it in good time, of course, buying souvenir programmes on the way in: two shillings and sixpence each – “daylight robbery”, my dad said, though cheap compared with the tickets, which cost over a pound (in some parts of the ground, they cost a mere 10 shillings). Still, the programme was a glossy production, with a blue cover: “Maybe it’ll be worth something one day,” my dad said.\nHe was right. Those in good condition can fetch up to £200. Mine has water stains, though, and I’d not want to part with it, if only because of the adverts, most of them for cigarettes and booze: Players No 6, Embassy (“The Accepted Cigarette”), Guinness, Gordon’s gin, Johnnie Walker, Carlsberg. There are also ads for The Black and White Minstrel Show (twice nightly at the Victoria Palace) and one from English Electric inviting applications from draughtsmen for “vacancies at all levels”. Apart from the ads, everything in the programme, including the picture captions, appears in four languages: English, French, Spanish and German. The first photo, taking up a page, is of the Queen; photos of the Fifa organising committee take up another three. They include a professor, two doctors and a man in military uniform – a serious-looking bunch seemingly untainted by bribery and corruption.\n\n\n\n\n \n\nEngland were in red, having lost the toss for who would wear white. It seemed a bad omen\n\n\nWhile the Royal Marines band played, my dad got out his fountain pen and wrote down the England team in the programme’s centre spread: Banks, Cohen, Wilson, Styles (sic), J Charlton, Moore, Peters, R Charlton, Ball … He didn’t get as far as our two front men, Hurst and Hunt, let alone Held, Haller and the Germans, because the teams came out. England were in red, having lost the toss for who would wear white. Red shirts weren’t as bad as grey. It seemed a bad omen all the same.\nSure enough, the Germans were soon ahead: a poor header from Ray Wilson and there was Haller. It might have stayed that way but for a smart piece of thinking from Bobby Moore, whose quickly taken free kick Hurst ghosted on to and glanced in: 1-1. Honours even at half-time. Among the tunes played during the interval by the marching massed bands was “Colonel Bogey”, to which, in the 1940s, the words “Hitler has only got one ball” were sung. The memory of wartime enmity was inescapable. But you didn’t talk about it. I can’t remember any acrimony between supporters. Nor segregation.\nEngland had the better of the second half, and after 78 minutes Martin Peters scored. At 2-1 and with a minute to play, I dared to hope. It was fair. It was fate. Blow the whistle, ref. Then Germany won a dubious free kick (had Jack Charlton really committed a foul?), the ball somehow evaded the England defence and hit Schnellinger (handball!), and Wolfgang Weber turned it in. Extra time. The Germans had the momentum now. We were bound to lose. Whoever was to blame – the Swiss referee, the hubristic Ramsey, God – had ruined a perfect day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\nEngland’s controversial third goal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nAll I could see were the frantic German protests. A sense of injustice flared up in me\n\n\nI felt little better after what happened next. In my memory, the “Russian linesman” (in fact, a former player called Tofiq Bahramov from Azerbaijan, in whose honour the national stadium in Baku is named) was standing directly below us. But the map on the back of my ticket suggests we were on the opposite side of the ground. Perhaps my angle of vision has been confused by 50 years of watching the TV replay. Whatever the case, when Hurst’s shot bounced down from the crossbar, Bahramov thought it crossed the line. Numerous scientific analyses and computer simulations have since found otherwise. All I could see were the frantic German protests. A sense of injustice flared up in me again, this time on their behalf. It wouldn’t be right for us to win 3-2, not with a ghost-goal like that.\nBut at the end, that’s exactly what I thought had happened: that we had won, unfairly, 3-2. Yes, Geoff Hurst (once again fed brilliantly by Moore) had smashed the ball in for a seeming hat-trick. Yes, the Wembley scoreboard said 4-2. But I knew my rulebook. After a goal is scored, the opposition must always kick off again. And the Germans hadn’t kicked off again. The final whistle must have gone before the ball hit the net. Unlike the 99,999 other spectators, I left the stadium knowing there’d been a misunderstanding, which the ref would soon clear up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Geoff Hurst scores England’s fourth goal. Photograph: Allsport/MSI\n\n\nBut every copy of the evening paper – printed at amazing speed – said England had won 4-2. And though my schoolboy pedantry told me I was right and everyone else wrong, I didn’t want to spoil the celebrations. At 15, tied to my parents, I couldn’t celebrate as euphorically as everyone else in London, by jumping into fountains, kissing strangers on the steps of Eros, and getting drunk. But I was happy watching the fun. And happy lying awake through the small hours as cars circled Piccadilly Circus parping their horns.\n\n\n\n\n1966 World Cup: how apathy turned to joy in England’s golden summer | Simon Burnton\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWithin a week I’d developed chickenpox, and next thing I was back at school. The 30 July had been a great day. Now it was time to look ahead. With the team England had, there would surely be other triumphs in the years to come: the next European Championships, the next World Cup, all the ones after that. Thank God I’d never have to become an old man telling his children or (laughable prospect!) grandchildren how he was there in the stadium when Bobby Moore, after carefully wiping his hands, accepted the trophy from the Queen and an England football team, for the one and only time, won the World Cup.\n"

        "text": "\nFifa is sport’s equivalent of a failed state. It is an organisation so self-serving that it has lost all contact with how it looks to the outside world. This the only way of explaining, in the face of multiple indictments and confessions of bribery and corruption, Fifa’s carry-on-regardless approach: its most senior officials inhabit a parallel universe.\nThat may seem harsh when the investigatory arm of Fifa’s own ethics committee has finally taken action against the three men at the pinnacle of the organisation. Not only the president Sepp Blatter, but also Fifa’s general secretary Jérôme Valcke and the Uefa general secretary Michel Platini are suspended for 90 days. All three are under investigation by the Swiss attorney general and, in Mr Blatter’s case, reportedly also by the FBI. All three strongly protest their innocence. But so opaque is the internal business of Fifa, so totally has the organisation lost the confidence of observers, that many outsiders suspect that Mr Blatter is still somehow calling the shots.\nThe fourth man disciplined on Thursday, the Korean billionaire Chung Mong-joon, who was banned from football for six years, protested that it was a deliberate move to destroy his hopes in next February’s presidential contest. Every step towards greater transparency that appeared to promise genuine change, like the appointment of the American lawyer Michael Garcia to investigate allegations of corruption in the awarding of the 2018 and 2022 world cups to Russia and Qatar has been smothered. When even the man who has now taken over as interim president, Issa Hayatou, has been censured by the International Olympic Committee for taking kickbacks in 2011, it is surely too late for Fifa to heal itself.\nYet there are no obvious pressure points in Fifa’s complex internal structure; there are no easy incentives for those with the power to push reform in an organisation that has elevated the art of mutual backscratching to an artform. In theory, the election for Mr Blatter’s successor, for which nominations close at the end of this month, could provide leverage. But that would depend on two highly unlikely developments: first the appearance of a candidate untainted by connexions with any of the current senior ranks of Fifa and secondly the discovery, among the national footballing bodies that make up the electorate, of a sensitivity to the monstrous reputational harm that Fifa suffers with each passing week that still appears to be completely absent.\nA lesser proposal, although still requiring support from within the organisation, would be to suspend the election and put Fifa into something like the special measures that Whitehall imposes on failing British schools. Bring in an eminent figure, a person who carries international confidence, to oversee the development and approval of a new system of governance. The IOC, which has its own history of fighting corruption after the Salt Lake City Winter Olympics scandal that broke in 1999, could be a model. That led to sackings and resignations. Now, still not perfect, a further round of reforms, to cut costs and strengthen transparency is coming.\nOn Thursday the IOC president Thomas Bach recommended that Fifa, which is a member organisation of the IOC, learn from his organisation’s “painful” experience. Or there are guiding principles drawn up by the Berlin-based New Fifa Now organisation, which is backed by Transparency International and the International TUC. At Westminster and in the European parliament, politicians are beginning to organise for change. That could lead to European football bodies taking a rather more muscular approach to Fifa’s problems than they have done so far. It was, at the least, surprising that even after his suspension, both the English and the French FA immediately reiterated their support for the candidacy of Mr Platini.\nGood governance is not that complicated; it takes institutional change and, almost more importantly, cultural change, and that requires leadership. If pressure for reform won’t come from football itself then it must come from the sponsors. That, and the greater sensitivity to the reputation of some Olympic sports, was what drove the IOC reforms. Earlier this week, long, long overdue disapproval came from the major US backers, who called for Mr Blatter’s resignation. But the big money in Fifa comes from global TV rights. Labour’s shadow sports minister, Christ Bryant, has called for British broadcasters to make buying the rights dependent on reform. He is right. It is time for the dollars to speak for change.\n"

It called on officials to begin “exhaustive inquiries” into possible illicit activities that might have occurred in relation to the Fifa scandal.\nTwo days later, McLaughlin told a legislative meeting that the editorial was “reckless” and “must be interpreted as a treasonous attack on the Cayman Islands and on all the people of Cayman”.

        "text": "\nFifa reform campaigners have called on the British authorities to do more to “follow the money” and help United States and Swiss investigators tackle corruption at world football’s governing body.\nAppearing before a parliamentary select committee inquiry into the fallout from the Fifa corruption crisis, Deborah Unger of Transparency International urged the Serious Fraud Office and other agencies to dig deeper.\n“They could use the follow-the-money tools that are already here. Questions do have to be asked. Has any money been spent in the UK on luxury goods and services, property for example?” Unger said. “It is very hard to go after people directly without knowing if the money has come through the UK. But you can start asking the questions.”\nIn the wake of the arrests and charges that followed dawn raids in Zurich in May and decades of allegations of bribery and corruption at Fifa, the SFO said it would examine whether it had a role to play. But Paul Farrelly, one of the MPs on the culture, media and sport select committee, said the SFO had not asked “a single question of the FA”.\n\n\n\n\nFresh arrests likely in Fifa corruption scandal, says US attorney general\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDamian Collins, a Tory MP on the committee who has been heavily involved in the New Fifa Now campaign to reform world football, said a payment made by the Australian 2022 bid team to Jack Warner, the disgraced former president of the Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football, was routed via the UK and should be investigated by the SFO.\nThe Swiss attorney general, Michael Lauber, has called on other jurisdictions to do more to help its investigation into the award of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. It has identified 121 suspicious bank transactions, seized data and confiscated properties in the Swiss Alps under suspicion of money-laundering since its investigation began in May.\n“We are also looking for means to accelerate the procedure; in this context an additional challenge might be seen in the fact some of the information of interest to our criminal proceedings is under seal,” Lauber said. “It would be helpful if parties involved would cooperate more substantially.”\nThe SFO has said it has “actively been assessing material in relation to this matter and has made plain it stands ready to assist continuing international criminal investigations.”\nThe witnesses, also including Jaimie Fuller of New Fifa Now and the former Australia 2022 bid executive turned whistleblower Bonita Mersiades, called for independent reform of Fifa and cast doubt on the internal process being led by former International Olympic Committee executive François Carrard. Earlier this week Domenico Scala, the head of Fifa’s audit and compliance committee, made his own reform proposals to feed into the process.\n“The reform process needs to be top to bottom. They are circling the wagons. They don’t want that kind of reform because they don’t want the scrutiny it will bring to the past,” Unger said. “We’ve called it a crisis of corruption and we’ll stand by that. I doubt the latest reform proposals from Scala will get very far.”\nIn the context of a discussion around the questions still to be answered by the FA, Fuller raised the historic case of two Trinidad & Tobago players with links to Warner who were granted work permits by the Home Office in 2001.\nFuller, the founder of sportswear brand Skins, said they had “applied for work permits, those work permits were declined, they lost the appeal, they magically got a work permit”.\nIt was reported in 2001 that the former sports minister Kate Hoey had claimed Carlos Edwards and Hector Sam, two Wrexham players with links to Warner, had been granted work permits in the hope of winning Warner’s support. The Home Office said at the time: “If new evidence comes to light and they meet the criteria, there’s nothing untoward about that.”\n"

        "text": "\nHave you heard the one about the latest research project into international sports governing bodies? Doesn’t sound like the beginning of a joke, does it? But wait for the punchline. Last month the respected Danish Institute of Sports Studies ranked all 35 federations belonging to the Olympic family based on how transparent, democratic and accountable they were. And guess which organisation came second, behind only the International Equestrian Federation? Fifa.\n\n\n\n\nFifa ethics committee to recommend sanctions against Sepp Blatter and Michel Platini\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, that Fifa. For while world football’s governing body is engulfed by a feculent smog of bribery and corruption – and its suspended president Sepp Blatter and vice-president Michel Platini, who deny wrongdoing, face being slung out – it still ranks higher on basic measures of governance than almost every other Olympic sport, according to the report’s author, Dr Arnout Geeraert. As he makes clear, it is not that Fifa is particularly praiseworthy. It is that the entire sports governance system is deeply flawed, from root tips to the top table. We have known as much for years, of course. But the almost daily revelations surrounding Fifa and the IAAF should be concentrating minds on the logical next question – how can we ensure it doesn’t happen again?\nThis is not as easy to answer as you might think. The difficulty is twofold. First, international sports organisations are autonomous, which allows them to keep governments at arm’s length. Second, as Geeraert highlights in his report, their institutional design also does not allow “stakeholders to monitor and sanction decision-making members”.\n\n\n\n\nSaid & Done: George Osborne; God; and Diego’s token of love\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn his 126-page report into what he hails as the legitimacy crisis in sports governance, Geeraert notes behaviours more akin to a banana republic. Not a single sporting federation publishes the per diem payments and bonuses it gives to senior officials, or has term limits for its president. Only four out of 35 have a committee that performed integrity and professional checks on those nominated for senior positions. Less than a third publish externally audited annual financial reports. And that is just a snapshot.\nIt was telling too that Transparency International published a report last week which detailed how Fifa gave a minimum of $2.05m to each of its 209 member football associations – yet 81% of those have no financial records publicly available.\n\n\n\n\nDick Pound: fixing doping problems should be ‘child’s play’ for Russia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPut a few smart people in a room and their suggestions to fix the system would be broadly similar. Executive term limits. Greater transparency. Independent ethics committees. Non-executive directors to scrutinise executive committees. Clear conflict of interest and anti-corruption guidelines. More stringent corporate governance rules. Complete salary disclosures. Whatever you think of Seb Coe, can it be right that he does not receive a salary as IAAF president when his organisation has $76m of reserves?\nHowever, as Roger Pielke Jr, a political scientist at the University of Colorado Boulder, explains, the question is not what needs to be done to fix the system but how to do it, which has proven elusive. Tellingly, when asked what he would do if he was given a year to fix Fifa, he admits: “I’m not sure much can be done from the inside.”\nSo if Fifa won’t heal itself, how can it be cured? “I’d much prefer that Fifa be put into administration by the Swiss government – declaring a sort of ‘governance bankruptcy’ – and then a temporary reform leadership rebuild the place from the ground up,” he says. “If it can happen to some of the world’s largest banks then perhaps it could happen in sport too. In this way it could serve as a model for other sports bodies, both of what true reform looks like and the consequences of complete governance failure.”\nMeanwhile Professor David Forrest, an applied economist at the University of Liverpool, wonders whether a primary source of corruption – the awarding of hosting rights for major championships – needs to be ripped up. Both the IOC and Fifa have monopoly power when it comes to Olympics and World Cups and, as he points out, history shows that countries that want those events have been able to bribe voters. So instead of making it a beauty contest, he suggests an auction. Highest bidder wins – with the money being given to help sport, not line officials’ pockets. Rules could be put in place to ensure such events switch continents regularly, and to ensure that those ranked poorly on the Corruption Perceptions Index were not able to enter the auction.\nIt might also be worth looking at the system of one country, one vote for presidential elections which can give tiny nations considerable influence in the corridors of power. Before the recent IAAF elections, Coe spent months criss-crossing the world trying to secure the majority of the votes of the 217 countries. For while almost half these countries had either one or no athletes at the World Championships – including the likes of Comoros, San Marino and Tuvalu – their vote counted as much as Kenya, Jamaica and the US, the top three nations in the medal table. Fifa, which has 209 countries voting for its president (many of them tiny islands and dependencies) has the same issue. Qualified majority voting takes place without fuss or fanfare in the European Union. Perhaps it might be worth exploring for sporting bodies too?\nBut such questions are for another day. And perhaps even for another decade. Because while governments are happy to throw out soundbites, they seem reluctant to apply the sort of long-term pressure that would result in change. As a result it remains too easy for corrupt sporting officials to grease a familiar groove of nods and winks, backscratches and backhanders, cashing out and covering it up.\n"

        "text": "\nFor an athlete who spends much of his time running around in circles, Martyn Rooney is impressively adept at giving straight answers. When the European 400m champion is asked whether he feels the IAAF has betrayed track and field and its athletes he doesn’t prevaricate. “Yes, definitely,” he replies. “We’re seen as worse than Fifa and cycling, and I think the sport’s in trouble.” That’s Rooney in a nutshell. Honest, direct – and usually correct.\nRooney, who so brilliantly captained the British squad and anchored its 4x400m team to bronze at last year’s world championships, goes further still. He believes that the bribery and corruption scandals involving the IAAF –“a billionaire’s paradise, and that never fills you with confidence” – and Russian officials and athletes have led to “people not trusting the sport any more” and ruined athletes’ lives. “If I was a female middle-distance runner, and [the British 1500m runner] Lisa Dobriskey springs to mind, I’d be gutted,” he says “She could be a multiple, multiple Olympic and world medallist.”\n\n\n\n\nMartyn Rooney wins individual place at world championships on appeal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRooney, 28, also wonders if he was robbed of an Olympic medal in 2008, when Britain’s 4x400m team finished fourth behind a Russia team containing Denis Alekseyev, who was later banned for taking performance-enhancing drugs. Given the systemic doping that has since been exposed in that country by the World Anti-Doping Agency Independent Commission, you cannot blame him. “We should have been relay medallists in 2008,” he says. “And it would have completely changed my life. I probably would have had a couple of houses in Croydon now. It’s where my parents live and I can’t afford to put a deposit down there.”\nFor the most part, though, there is an obvious spring in Rooney’s step, even in these dog days of winter. He is living a “dream life”, he says, made even better by the birth of his son, Jack, last August – in the same week he won a world championship bronze. Then there is his training, which is going “10 times” better than this time last year as he builds towards Rio 2016 this summer. “I’m doing things that I didn’t think I could do at any time of my life, and I’m doing it in January of an Olympic year,” he says, lightly touching the bench he is sitting on. Yet all that is tempered by the frustrations of watching the sport he loves fall deeper in the mire.\nRooney is not sure whether the IAAF, athletics’ governing body, should be ripped up and built again from the ground up. But in the wake of the scandal that has led to bans for the former IAAF treasurer Valentin Balakhnichev, the head of anti-doping Gabriel Dollé and the former IAAF president’s son, Papa Massata Diack, he does wonder whether the organisation needs to adopt more radical solutions.\nOne idea Rooney has is for everyone involved at a senior level during the past seven or eight years to step aside for the good of the sport. “We do need a clean start,” he explains. “And that might involve a refresh of whoever was involved in the IAAF over the past seven years or so, from the top down. Unfortunately we’re at a situation where the best people will be collateral damage.”\nWe are talking at Loughborough’s Seb Coe High Performance Athletics Centre, where Rooney trains every day. Do such comments apply to the new IAAF president? “I assume so, yes,” he says. “I think he’s probably the only person to fix it, and I definitely believe he’s skilled enough to do the job. It’s just unfortunate that his name is tarnished with everybody else’s.”\nRooney stresses that he is a “still a fan” of Coe, who has been generous with his advice. But he wasn’t convinced by the IAAF president’s appearance at a parliamentary select committee in December, during which Coe was accused by MPs of wilful blindness in terms of his lack of curiosity into what was going on at the organisation when he was IAAF vice president from 2007-15. “Obviously London 2012 took up a lot of his time, and you have to applaud the man for doing an incredible job, but there did seem like he wanted plausible deniability,” Rooney says. “He didn’t want to see anything, or have to know about it, so then he didn’t have to answer questions about it. And that’s not who you want. If there was something going on at British Athletics, I would ask the tough questions and speak to the people I needed to speak to.”\nWhen it comes to other ideas for restoring confidence in athletics, Rooney says he is a fan of the British Athletics chairman Ed Warner’s plan to reset all world records and introduce lifetime bans for serious drug cheats. “He got slated but I’m massively behind it,” says Rooney. “I think the only way we’re going to save the sport is by having lifetime bans, because people just don’t trust it any more. I was on Talksport [radio] recently and they said: ‘Well surely everyone’s on drugs.’ No, we’re really not. But that’s the image. So we have to get the faith back in the sport.”\nThat loss of trust has had consequences. Rooney is extremely grateful for the support of the National Lottery and his sponsor, Nike, but the athletics circuit is less lucrative now than it was a decade ago – a consequence of the economic downturn and poor governance at the IAAF.\n“When I first started in 2006 there was good money to be made,” he says. “But then the Diamond League came in and ruined it. You can go to the Diamond League and come third or fourth, or whatever, and you make less than you used to make when you went to Italy or Germany. You could make €4,000 racing back then. Now you might be looking at $2,000 a race. I’m not complaining – athletics is a sport I love – but after you have paid your taxes and agent, you’re not seeing that much of it.”\nFor now, though, Rooney’s focus is on Rio. During his career he has won two world and four European medals, yet a place on the Olympic podium has eluded him. His best individual effort came in 2008, when he was unbeaten in 11 of his 400m races going into Beijing and produced a personal best of 44.60sec on his way to finishing sixth in the final, despite throwing up beforehand. “It was just nerves and adrenaline,” says Rooney. “I puked up all through that season. I went to the London grand prix and was at Crystal Palace and you had the tent for the final call and the wall around it. People were looking down at me and I was puking my guts up.”\nIn the tunnel before the men’s 4x400m in Beijing in 2008, the British squad whistled the Great Escape to help them relax. But the Russian team, anchored by Alekseyev, squashed their hopes of a medal. At London 2012, meanwhile, Rooney remembers completely losing his focus when someone started calling his name before his 400m semi-final. “One guy shouted it, then a little area shouts it, then it started spreading around the stadium. I had no preparation, I was getting goose bumps and stuff. I completely lost it.\n“All I thought was: ‘Don’t false start.’ Then that was my race over. I had a plan going into the race. But like Mike Tyson says, everyone has a plan until they are punched in the face. That was my punch in the face and I didn’t handle it well.”\nIn the 4x400m he anchored the team to fourth again – just 0.13 behind Trinidad and Tobago. Little wonder, therefore, that Rooney believes he has unfinished business.\nHe also believes that he is a far better and more mature athlete, who is approaching his peak. Much of that is down to his coach, Rana Reider. “I used to think I was doing something world-class, but joining Rana in 2013 reinvigorated me,” he says. “He’s on it. He doesn’t let me rest up, there’s no messing about, it’s always 100%. It’s encouraged me to raise my game.”\nWhen Reider left British Athletics to move to the Netherlands in late 2014, Rooney took a while to adjust to being remotely coached. “This time last year everything was a bit all over the place,” he concedes. “I was angry at Rana, angry at British Athletics, angry at everybody because I thought I had a perfect situation and then it had just been taken away from me.”\nRooney struggled so much in 2015 that he initially was picked only for the 4x400m for the world championships and got selected only after an appeal. “I believe 100% there was no trust in me,” he says. “But that’s the way it is. I just can’t put myself in a position where I rely on other people’s trust.”\nYet Rooney was made captain for the British team and went on to run a personal best of 44.45 in his heat and a storming anchor leg in the final of the 4x400m. But he is convinced there is far more to come, and that it is not outlandish to expect another PB and a first Olympic medal. “This is the most confident I have been in my body,” he says. “It’s nice to come off that winter and be healthy. Everything is going in the right direction. It’s my time now.”\n"

        "text": "\nRolls-Royce has called in a leading law firm to help it deal with bribery allegations and a Serious Fraud Office (SFO) investigation.\nSlaughter and May has been brought in while the SFO investigates allegations of bribery and corruption at the FTSE 100 engineer.\nRolls-Royce was initially accused of paying bribes to win contracts in China and Indonesia, but it has also been linked to the corruption scandal facing Brazil’s state-owned oil company Petrobras, and the SFO has said it is looking into several of the UK company’s divisions.\n\n\n\n\nRolls-Royce faces second investigation in Brazil corruption scandal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe news that Slaughter and May, one of the UK’s top five law firms, is working with Rolls-Royce underlines the seriousness with which the company is treating the investigation, launched in December 2013.\nRolls-Royce hired the New York law firm Debevoise & Plimpton in 2012 to conduct an internal investigation after the SFO requested information from the company, after a whistleblower made allegations about its conduct in China and Indonesia. This investigation led to Rolls-Royce handing further information to the SFO, which launched a formal inquiry into the company.\nIt is understood Slaughter and May was initially hired by Rolls-Royce two years ago as its joint legal counsel, meaning it worked for the company on financial transactions.\nHowever, it is now also advising Rolls-Royce on the corruption allegations, with leading litigation partners drafted in, and is thought to be the company’s principal adviser.\nSlaughter and May has a history of helping major British companies deal with corruption allegations. It defended GlaxoSmithKline, Britain’s biggest pharmaceutical company, over an investigation into its conduct in Iraq during Saddam Hussein’s regime. The firm’s partners Richard Swallow and Jonathan Clark are working with the engine maker on the investigations. \nRolls-Royce, which makes engines for the Airbus A380 superjumbo, has said it is cooperating with the SFO and authorities in Brazil investigating Petrobras.\nThe company is facing one of the biggest challenges in its history. As well as the SFO investigation, Rolls-Royce has issued four profit warnings in the past year and faces calls to be broken up.\nValueAct, an activist investor, has built a 5.4% stake in the company, and wants Rolls-Royce to sell off its marine division, badly affected by the decline in the oil price, to focus on producing engines for civil aeroplanes.\nWarren East, the new chief executive of Rolls-Royce, has rejected ValueAct’s calls and refused to offer the investor a seat on the board.\nEast will outline his strategy for Rolls-Royce at an investor day next Tuesday. However, he gave a glimpse into his plans last week when he issued another profits warning and said the company needed to cut costs to be more agile.\n\n\n\n\nRolls-Royce and BAE to cut jobs as march of the makers stumbles again\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRolls-Royce blamed its profit warning on falling demand for corporate jets in Brazil, China and south-east Asia, a decline in maintenance and servicing revenues from its engines for large planes and energy industry customers being affected by the slump in the oil price. The Derby-based group now expects profit “headwinds” of £650m next year, more than double the £300m cut to profits identified earlier in the year.\nIn response, East wants to reduce costs by up to £200m a year at the same time as improving decision-making, which will lead to Rolls-Royce cutting jobs some of the 2,000 senior managers it employs around the world.\nRolls-Royce is struggling largely as a result of investing in wide-bodied aircraft, such as the A380, at a time when demand is focused on narrow-bodied passenger plans. Rolls-Royce abandoned the narrow-bodied market in 2013 when it pulled out of a joint venture with its rival Pratt & Whitney so it could focus on wide-bodied aircraft and the next generation of single-aisle planes that should follow the Airbus A320neo and Boeing 737 Max.\nAnalysts at Agency Partners said Rolls-Royce faces “existential risks”, including a decline in the use of its older engines – which will reduce the aftermarket sales that Rolls-Royce enjoys – and a general weakening in the aerospace market.\nThe analysts said: “The last point is important, as the crisis to date has been largely specific to Rolls-Royce and has occurred against the background of unprecedented sustained strength in civil aerospace markets – overlaying a sector downturn on Rolls-Royce own crisis would make life yet more difficult.\n“We believe Rolls-Royce is well into a familiar aerospace and defence sector ‘near death experience’ pattern, which suggests that the shares have another 40% and six-plus months to fall.”\nAll parties declined to comment.\n"

        "text": "\nFormer Tesco chief executive Philip Clarke is set to be questioned by the Serious Fraud Office as it nears the conclusion of an investigation into a multi-million-pound accounting scandal at the retailer.\nClarke, who left Tesco in August last year after overseeing a dive in sales and profits, will be interviewed under caution by the SFO, meaning that any testimony he gives can be used in evidence. Tesco’s former commercial director, Kevin Grace, has also been called in, according to Bloomberg which first reported the story. \n\n\n\n\nAccountancy watchdog to focus on suppliers after Tesco profits scandal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe SFO kicked off a criminal investigation into accounting practices at Tesco in October 2014 after the company admitted that it had overstated profits by £263m because it had incorrectly booked payments from suppliers, for reasons such as marketing costs or reaching sales target. Some Tesco suppliers and other directors including Carl Rogberg, the former UK finance director, Laurie McIlwee, the former group finance director, are also believed to have had contact with the SFO earlier this year.\nThe issue is also being investigated by the grocery market watchdog – the Groceries Code Adjudicator – and the accountancy watchdog, the Financial Reporting Council.\nThe profit black hole emerged just weeks after the arrival of new chief executive Dave Lewis, who was brought in to turn around falling sales and profits at Britain’s biggest retailer.\nAfter a whistleblower alerted Lewis, a team of forensic accountants from Deloitte established that Tesco had artificially inflated an estimate of first-half profits given to the City in August last year. They found similar practices had been in place in prior reporting periods. In April this year, Tesco said it had found another £60m more in mis-statements from previous years, mostly as a result of an audit of its Irish operations.\nTesco declined to comment on Thursday but has previously said that it would fully co-operate with the SFO. Earlier this year, that led to speculation that the supermarket could be one of the first companies in the UK to strike a new type of deal with the SFO which would enable it to avoid a criminal prosecution. SFO director, David Green, has said he expects the investigation into Tesco will be resolved by the end of this year.\nUnder new powers introduced last year, the SFO can offer a “deferred prosecution agreement” (DPA), which requires high court approval. It includes fines and other undertakings, if that is considered to be in the public interest and a company cooperates. \nIn May, Ben Morgan, the SFO’s joint head of bribery and corruption, revealed that the watchdog had handed out its first invitation letters for companies to enter into DPA negotiations. A DPA deal does not protect individuals who might face criminal charges with the help of evidence provided by the company.\nClarke joined Tesco as a schoolboy shelf-stacker in 1974. His father also worked for the business. He took over from long-term Tesco boss, Terry Leahy, in 2011 and spent more than £1bn revamping the chain’s UK stores and product ranges. Yet he failed to spot rising competition from discounters such as Aldi and Lidl early enough or to stem the tide of shopper defections to rivals. \nThe announcement of his departure last summer came as a surprise for Clarke, who was preparing to celebrate his 40th year at the company with a party in central London. Clarke said it was an “emotional” time but that he had “nothing to regret” during his three-year reign. \nClarke was paid £1.2m for loss of office. Tesco tried and failed to withhold that payment, and another to McIlwee, while it carried out an investigation into the accounting scandal. It has said would seek to recover the money if either was found to have been guilty of gross misconduct. “We have explicitly reserved the company’s rights to pursue recovery of these payments,” the retailer said in its annual report published in May.\nTesco continues to endure a difficult period. Worries about poor trading and difficulties with planned sales of its South Korean and Clubcard business have driven the company’s shares down more than 12% in the past month alone.\nThe retailer slumped to a record annual loss of £6.4bn when it announced it had axed nearly 5,000 head office and UK store management jobs, as well as more than 4,000 roles overseas and at the group’s banking division. A further 2,500 jobs were lost with the closure of 43 Tesco stores earlier this month.\n"

        "text": "\n Fifa’s president, Sepp Blatter, has refused to set foot in the US for almost four years due to a continuing investigation by the FBI, according to a major new ESPN documentary.\nThe E60 programme, aired on Tuesday evening in the US, claimed that Blatter was reluctant to travel to the States due to an FBI investigation into the controversial process that led to the award of the 2018 and 2022 World Cup finals.\nSources have also told the Guardian that US investigators have been in touch with Swiss prosecutors over their investigation, with which the former Fifa executive committee member Chuck Blazer is believed to be cooperating.\nAccording to reports last year, Blazer agreed to cooperate after he was approached over huge unpaid tax bills related to commissions he had received during his time as Concacaf general secretary. For Blatter to be questioned, the government would have had to obtain an arrest warrant.\nFifa refused to provide details of Blatter’s travel arrangements but said that during his four-year “mandate period” he usually tried to visit as many of the 209 member associations as possible.\n“The information from ESPN that the Fifa president is avoiding travels to the USA because of any alleged FBI requests is absolutely untrue. Fifa has never received any request from the American law enforcement,” said a spokeswoman. The ESPN broadcast did not suggest that the FBI had made any such request. However, US sources said that Fifa would not need to be informed if the intention of the FBI was to question Blatter and other senior football officials. Later this month, Blatter is standing for his fifth term as Fifa president.\nNews of the FBI investigation first emerged in March 2013 with further details, including Blazer’s involvement, reported in November last in the New York Daily News.\nFifa last year conducted its own investigation into widespread claims of bribery and corruption during the chaotic bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 tournaments, awarded to Russia and Qatar respectively in December 2010. But the investigator Michael Garcia resigned after claiming a published summary misrepresented his findings and following concerted pressure Fifa eventually promised to publish his report in full with appropriate redactions.\nHowever, it will not do so until after cases against various individuals implicated by the report have been fully investigated by its ethics committee.\nMeanwhile the former Fifa executive committee member Reynald Temarii, currently general director of the Tahiti Football Association, has been banned from all football-related activity for eight years for accepting money from disgraced former Asian Football Confederation president Mohamed Bin Hammam to fund his legal fight against an earlier ban ahead of the World Cup vote.\nBin Hammam had offered to pay his legal costs to the tune of $346,000 in the hope of extending the appeal process and thus denying one of Qatar’s rivals for the 2022 World Cup an extra vote. Temarii was originally banned for requesting money from undercover reporters during the bidding process. \n"

        "text": "\nThe UK government will provide significant financial support to a major Dutch company despite the company being under investigation for its involvement in a multibillion-dollar corruption scandal in Brazil.\nEngineering company SBM Offshore – which is being investigated by Brazilian authorities over bribery allegations – confirmed that one of its flagship oil projects in Brazil will receive £34m worth of financial support from the UK.\nWhitehall trade officials have backed the Dutch company despite the ongoing investigation into its part in a sprawling corruption scandal that has ensnared Brazil’s state-owned oil company Petrobras, scores of senior politicians and business figures.\nThe announcement appeared less than 24 hours before David Cameron delivered a speech in Singapore on Tuesday this week, arguing that global corruption is “the enemy of progress” and the world has “looked the other way for too long”.\nThe UK’s generous support for SBM’s project follows dramatic developments in Brazil last month when a parliamentary inquiry repeatedly summoned SBM’s former agent in the country to answer questions about allegations he acted as a middleman for contractors, paying bribes to Petrobras executives and politicians. \nSBM have admitted to paying over $120m to the agent in Brazil between 2007- 2011 but insist the company has severed all ties with the Brazilian national, Julio Faerman, who is believed to be living in London.\nEarlier this year, Brazil’s Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper reported that SBM transferred around $77m to the Swiss bank accounts of two offshore companies owned by Faerman, according to documents provided by the Swiss attorney general.\nThe Petrobras scandal – one of the largest corruption scandals in Brazil’s history – has weighed on the Brazilian economy for much of this year.\nLast year, SBM paid out $240m in a settlement with Dutch prosecutors investigating alleged bribery in Angola, Equatorial Guinea and Brazil. Prosecutors established that payments were made from SBM’s agent in Brazil to government officials.\nThe company, which builds and operates specialist ships for the oil and gas industry, insists the settlement “closed a chapter from the past”. \nSpeaking months before the company agreed to cooperate with the Brazilian attorney general and comptroller general’s inquiries, a senior SBM director told the Dutch press: “I really think we paid our dues … We refuse to be Brazil’s smelly kid in the classroom.”\nBut SBM was dealt a blow last year when Petrobras, one of its biggest customers, refused to award the company any new contracts while SBM was under investigation. \nThe Dutch multinational had previously won major deals with Petrobras for expensive oil production and storage ships which it owns with joint venture partners. The UK’s export finance agency (UKEF) will provide a £34m tranche of insurance for one of these ships.\nA spokesman for UKEF defended its support for the SBM project, stating that the agency follows strict international guidelines on anti-bribery and corruption. \n“Far from looking the other way, UKEF has taken careful account of the reforms undertaken by management at both SBM and Petrobras before deciding that our support could be given,” he said.\nA spokeswoman for SBM Offshore directed the Guardian to the company’s previous statements regarding the affair and emphasised that the company has put in place measures to improve compliance and transparency.\nResponding to the reported payments using Swiss bank accounts, the spokeswoman added: “Since 2012, we have been very transparent on all the steps we have taken to get our house in order and we’re not going to comment on any speculation made by any journalist.”\n"

        "text": "\nLovers of Dyson Heydon’s literary and historical flourishes must feel let down by the final report of the trade union royal commission.\nIn his numerous speeches and judgments we’re used to Heydon’s diversions into post-war Europe, ancient Rome, communism, the cold war, the Soviet Union, Othello and the Marquis of Halifax. Even the French revolutionary theorist the Abbé Sieyès made an extraordinary appearance in Heydon’s Malaysian declaration judgment (where the Gillard government was trying, unsuccessfully, to cart off asylum seekers to a country not a signatory to the Refugee Convention). \nIf there are any frolics of this nature in the weighty final report of the trade union royal commission (Turc) they must be well buried. Instead, we get a doorstop’s worth of dry recitation of findings and recommendations that scarcely surprise, let alone entertain. \n\n\n\n\nThe hits, the misses, and the zealous overreach of the trade union royal commission | Paul Karp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPossibly the royal commissioner decided to tone things down as a result of the fiasco surrounding his acceptance of an invitation to address a Liberal party dinner and the subsequent application for his recusal for apprehended bias. \nHe appears to have donned the straightjacket prescribed for him by attorney general George Brandis, who at the height of the Barwick lecture crisis declared: “He has an absolutely stainless reputation to punctilious integrity.” \nNot much fun to be had there.\nHeydon must have got the message and decided to grope around for someone else in the upstanding reputation department – if not stainless, at least drip-dry. This paragraph appeared at the very top of the final report’s preamble: \n\n\n\n\n \n\n[Former High Court chief justice] Sir Harry Gibbs was universally admired for probity. Near the end of his long life, much of which had been devoted to controversies about the meaning of the Constitution, he concluded that it did not matter much for the health of the nation what the Constitution meant, so long as one condition was satisfied. That was the inherent decency of the Australian people continued.\n\n\nThe relevance is mystifying, as is the decision to propel Sir Harry (Bill) Gibbs onto the field of battle, in this context. Gibbs, while a judge in Queensland, conducted a royal commission into allegations that the National Hotel in Brisbane was the centre of a call girl operation sanctioned by the Queensland police. \n\n\n\n\n \n\nLiterary references in judicial reasons are a way of giving us a peep into what's going on underneath the judicial robes\n\n\nAfter ruling great heaps of available information as inadmissible, and accepting an amount of perjured testimony, he could find no evidence of police corruption. \nThis finding was so disastrous that it is credited with empowering the rotten apples in the Queensland police for another 23 years – until the Fitzgerald royal commission came along.\nWhy on earth would Heydon launch his work by citing a conservative judge whose name is the kiss of death in the pantheon of royal commissions?\nHistorical and literary references in judicial reasons are a way of giving us a peep into what is going on underneath the judicial robes. So, a great treatise on trade union debauchery without the drape of artful asides removes the “penumbra of personal values” – to borrow a phrase from the lawyer and academic who writes under the name of Procrustes. \nIt’s not as though we haven’t been here before, with at least six earlier royal commissions and reports into trade union activities in the last 40 years, mostly commissioned in the Fraser and Howard years. In 1989, Heydon and his old chum the late Roderick Pitt Meagher did a report on the duties and fiduciary obligations of officials in employer and employee industrial organisations. \nThere’s a common theme to all these inquiries and their findings: greater oversight of the activities of union leaders, the criminal nature of some of their activities and the creation of new statutory regulatory powers. \nIt’s difficult to believe that it would cost $46m for the Heydon royal commission to take 21 months and 189 hearing days to arrive at much the same discoveries, with the caveat that it is hard to identify most types of union misconduct and that what had been uncovered is the “small tip of an enormous iceberg”.\nEconomist John Quiggin says the auditor general should be called in to “investigate this appalling waste of public money”. \nThe two people the Abbott government expected to be scalped, Bill Shorten and Julia Gillard, are home free. \nHeydon’s recommendations for structural reform include: uniform regulations for the deregistration of employee and employer union organisations; a new Registered Organisations Commission, along the lines of Asic; powers for the Fair Work regulator to investigate criminal offences (see also the Winneke royal commission into the BLF); proper training for union managers; improved financial management and accountability; etc. \nThis is an echo from down the ages. For instance, in 1976 the Sweeney royal commission found that the maritime unions were demanding indemnity payments from foreign shipowners to secure industrial protection. Legislation was recommended for proper reporting and accounting principles.\nIn 1982, the Winneke royal commission looked at bribery and corruption in the the building construction unions and, among other things, recommended legislation for the disclosure of loans to union officials. \nIn 1984, the Costigan royal commission examined the criminal activities of the ship painters and dockers union and recommended uniform state and federal laws to deal with racketeering. \nIn 1989, Heydon and Meagher recommended that union officials should have the same fiduciary duties as company directors. \nThis is not to say that the Turc report is without surprises. For example, it is mercifully free of Heydon’s usual Latinisms that he enjoys sprinkling on his work: “non haec in feeder veni” (from the 2013 Han Haron Monis implied freedom of communication case) and even “hostis humani generis” in the Jayant Patel case of 2012. \nThe extent to which a royal commissioner should keep away from public controversy was certainly a well-ventilated feature of Heydon’s term at the helm of the inquiry. The excitement of the Barwick lecture tended to overshadow what might have been controversial public forays. For instance, last year he launched a book, Democracy in Decline by the arch-conservative legal academic, James Allan from Queensland. \nThe tome got stuck into all the usual beasties: activist judges, bills of rights, and the dangerous spread of international law. Heydon let it all hang out as he piled on the praise: \n\n\n\n\n \n\nFor those whose world view is shaped by academia, by the public service ethos, by the metropolitan press, and by judicial-political consensus which does not tolerate dissenting opinions, the book will seem deeply shocking. \nFor anyone else it will be wonderfully refreshing and cleansing, like a sudden storm after a long succession of oppressively sultry days. \n\n\nOne can never be too vigilant against the treachery of the universities, those in public service, the wicked popular press, and mainstream judicial thinking. \nThese messages occasionally shone through in Heydon’s high court judgments. In the human rights case of Vera Momcilovic, with a bit of help from Iago, he said: \n\n\n\n\n \n\nThe odour of human rights is sweet and addictive. It is a comforting drug stronger than poppy or mandragora or all the drowsy syrups in the world. But the effect can only be maintained over time by increasing the strength of the dose. In human rights circles there are no enemies on the left, so to speak.\n\n\nHe also gave the “shirt of Nessus” a long-overdue outing in Moncilovic. \n\n\n\n\nTrade union royal commission timeline: how it reached its final report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe also missed from the final report of the Turc his concerns about Soviet communism that he enjoyed weaving into his high court reasons. For instance, in South Australia v Totani he reminded us that conditions in Adelaide are very different from the Soviet Union, “in the days when ‘the wonderful Georgian’ [Stalin] was responsible for administering the bill of rights provisions contained in the 1936 constitution and Harold Laski was ‘lecturing about the beauties of the Russian system’.” \nSo the great cold war warrior, opponent of a modern rights-based civil society, who gave the academically underweight Tony Abbott a Rhodes scholarship, has coughed-up the goods – devoid of the historical and linguistic adornment we’ve come to expect. \nHe did it relatively quickly, no doubt bearing in mind his own observation about slow lane litigation, where, “The torpid languor of one hand washes the drowsy procrastination of the other.” \nAnd here the torpor of summer hasn’t helped employment minister Michaelia Cash ramp-up Heydon’s report into a full-blooded, spellbinding election issue. \n"

Rolls-Royce has won more than a 50% market share in engines for the superjumbo, in addition to being selected by the majority of the planes’ customers. Its engines have been powering Emirates aircraft since 1996.\nJohn Rishton, the chief executive of Rolls-Royce, said: “We are delighted that Emirates has again placed its trust in our technology, with the biggest order in our history.”\nTerry Scuoler, chief Executive of EEF, the manufacturers’ organisation, hailed the deal as a “huge boost for UK industry and a vote of confidence in British engineering excellence”. \nHe added: “The aerospace sector is critical for manufacturing and high-skill jobs, in particular, the many companies that cascade down through the supply chain.”\nAdam Marshall, head of the British Chambers of Commerce, said of the deal: “The UK’s strength in advanced manufacturing becomes clear when companies win major orders across the globe. \n“Given that manufactured goods still represent a major portion of the value of our exports, we need to continue to promote and support manufacturing companies of all sizes as they seek to break into new markets around the world.”\nDescribing Rolls-Royce as a key partner, the president of Emirates, Sir Tim Clark, said thatcontinual improvements in the economic and operational performance of the Trent 900 had been “decisive factors in our selection of the product for 50 of our A380s”.\nHe added: “Today’s announcement is significant not only because it cements the partnership between Emirates and Rolls-Royce, but also because of the significant economic impact that this will have on aviation manufacturing in the UK and Europe.”\nThe Trent 900 engine powered the first commercial A380 in 2007 and is now used by eight operators in more than 70 aircraft. Rolls-Royce says the engine is highly fuel efficient, with the latest version including technology developed for the Trent XWB and Trent 1000 engines.\nThe order is a boost for Rolls-Royce, which had its first fall in annual sales in a decade last yearAbout 1,700 jobs are expected to go in the UK. \nA Serious Fraud Office investigation into allegations of bribery and corruption is also hanging over the Derby-based group, following claims of malpractice in Indonesia and China.\n"

        "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/sep/26/michel-platini-sepp-blatter-fifa-payment",
        "text": "\nCriminal investigators in Switzerland have taken another walk up to Fifa HQ, that once impregnable bunker high on a Zurich hill, and finally knocked on the door of the president, Sepp Blatter. Five months before the departure he has scheduled after a generational 41 years working at football’s world governing body, Blatter is now the target of criminal proceedings and it will particularly wound him that his own country, where he has always been so cosy, has turned forensic on him.\nBut Michel Platini – the man who would be king, having declared his candidacy and become the clear favourite to replace Blatter in February’s presidential election – has serious questions to answer about these proceedings, which he has clearly failed to recognise.\nThe office of the Swiss attorney general, Michael Lauber, which is releasing just enough basic detail about its Fifa investigations to be explosive, announced to the world that one of its two criminal proceedings centred on Blatter concerns a 2m Swiss francs (approximately £1.35m at today’s rates) payment he made to Platini in February 2011. The other involves a television contract signed in 2005 with Jack Warner, the disgraced Caribbean football baron who once threatened Blatter with a “tsunami” of revelations. The Trinidadian did not quite plan, though, for it to happen while he is under indictment by US federal authorities for huge alleged bribery and corruption, which he denies.\nLauber’s office said in its statement that the payment by Blatter was “allegedly” for work Platini had done at Fifa between January 1999 and June 2002 – almost nine years before the money dropped into Platini’s bank account. The football world immediately saw alarm in the timing: spring 2011 was when Platini decided not to run against Blatter for Fifa president and instead endorsed Blatter.\nPlatini had understood Blatter would step down that year after concluding his third term as president, but, when Blatter went back on that, Platini had the option of running against him. Instead, the Frenchman backed him, and in May 2011 Uefa’s executive committee urged its 53 national associations to vote for Blatter. Now we know that shortly before that Blatter paid him 2m Swiss francs.\nThe attorney general’s statement made it clear that while Blatter is under suspicion for that “disloyal payment”, a criminal offence, Platini was interviewed on Friday – understood to have been for four hours at Fifa HQ – not as a suspect but as “a person asked to provide information”.\nPlatini put out a statement stressing that he is not a suspect and he sought to make light of this encounter with criminal investigators, portraying the money – nine years late – as entirely normal. “Regarding the payment that was made to me, I wish to state that this amount relates to work which I carried out under a contract with Fifa and I was pleased to have been able to clarify all matters relating to this with the authorities.”\nGreg Dyke, the FA chairman, who backed Platini for Fifa president in July, almost immediately the Uefa president announced his candidacy, offered some characteristically premature and ill-thought out reaction, telling ITV News: “I know no more than you do,” before focusing all his comments on Blatter.\nHowever, Dyke might have been better taking a step back and considering the questions this raises for Platini. They come at a time when Fifa is near collapse with corruption allegations, indictments and arrests and with Platini, president of European football’s governing body, presenting himself as the ideal candidate to clean the whole sorry mess up. These are the highest stakes possible for the integrity of the game and if Platini is to ascend to head Fifa – or even remain as president of Uefa – he has to give grown-up answers to the obvious doubts raised.\nFor a start, why on earth was Platini being paid in February 2011 for work he did at Fifa, as Blatter’s special advisor, which finished nine years earlier? If it was indeed a payment for that work, does that mean Platini worked for three years at Fifa – before he had another well-remunerated source of salary as Uefa president – without being paid? Why did Fifa not pay him, if that was the case? What did he do for money in that time and what efforts did he make to get Blatter to pay him for the time he had spent advising him – with his contract presumably not being honoured?\nThen, why did February 2011 suddenly become the moment chosen for Platini to be paid? How did this happen? Did Platini finally decide it was about time he nagged for the money or did Blatter suddenly discover the yellowing invoices on Platini-headed paper, buried for nearly a decade at the bottom of his in-tray?\nPlatini also needs to address the question of timing. Why did he endorse Blatter rather than run against him and did it, definitely, have nothing to do with the payment? There is also the question of why Platini is only “a person asked to provide information” while Blatter is a criminal suspect over the same payment. It is difficult to understand why, if the money was owed to Platini on a contract he had with Fifa, however belatedly it was being paid, the settlement of that legitimate debt should be “a disloyal payment”.\nPlatini, a former great as a player, has in his eight years as Uefa president developed the winning art of dismissing serious questions with a shrug of charm, humour and professed naivety. He has suffered remarkably little pressure over his vote for Qatar to host the 2022 World Cup, which followed lunch at the Élysée Palace with the then French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, and the prime minister and son of the emir of Qatar.\nPlatini has said he knew Sarkozy supported Qatar and wanted the Qataris to buy and fund Paris Saint-Germain, which they later did, but says his president did not ask him to vote for Qatar and the lunch did not influence him. Platini’s son, Laurent, was then hired as chief executive by the Qatari sportswear firm, Burrda, a recruitment Platini has said was unconnected to his vote and made because Laurent is a capable professional.\nFor Blatter, the knock on the door must be a nightmare he never dreamed would come to pass in all his years at the top. His would-be successor cannot pretend there are no questions here for him, because that would take world football, and all those who love it, for fools.\nPlatini needs to respond to this with clarity, or to apply the word being honestly promised for the new reformed Fifa: transparency.\n"

        "text": "\nA lawyer at the centre of controversy over the sale of Irish state-owned properties worth more than £1bn in Northern Ireland has denied that any politician benefited financially from the selloff.\n\n\n\n\nNCA to investigate bribery claims over biggest Northern Ireland property deal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIan Coulter, a former managing partner at the Belfast law firm Tughans, which was involved in negotiating the deal for a US investment fund, confirmed on Wednesday that he had a portion of the fees relating to the transaction transferred to an account he controlled in the Isle of Man. However, Coulter denied that he or any politician had benefited financially.\n“The fees payable were paid into a Tughans company account supervised by the firm’s finance team,” he said. “In September 2014, a portion of the fees was retained by Tughans and I instructed Tughans’ finance director to transfer the remaining portion into an external account which was controlled only by me. Not a penny of this money was touched. \n“No politician nor any relative of any politician in Northern Ireland was ever to receive any monies in any way as part of this deal. This was never discussed, assumed nor expected.”\nMick Wallace, a leftwing Irish parliamentarian, has alleged that £7m was placed in the Isle of Man account for a politician from Northern Ireland.\nIn a statement released through a Belfast-based PR firm, Coulter said he had directed the transfer of money for “a complex, commercially and legally sensitive” reason.\nHe said he had explained to Tughans why he transferred the money, which “will be explained to the appropriate authorities”. He left Tughans in January.\nTughans issued a statement on Wednesday saying that it “strongly disagrees with his version of events”.\nThe Police Service of Northern Ireland has called in the UK’s National Crime Agency to investigate allegations of bribery and corruption relating to the property deal.\nThe debt-ridden properties were inherited by the Irish state after the financial crash of 2008. When Ireland nationalised most of its banks, the state created the National Assets Management Agency. Nama took control of around 850 properties in Northern Ireland, which it then tried to sell off to US investment funds.\nWallace, an independent TD, claimed that a payment of £7m was due to be made to a Northern Irish politician. No evidence has been produced in support of the claim.\nA fee of £7.5m was paid to Tughans for work it did on behalf of Brown Rudnick, the lawyers that represented Cerberus, the US investment fund that eventually bought Nama’s Northern Ireland properties.\nCoulter said in his statement: “I have not received any personal financial benefit for my work on this transaction. Neither I nor any third party has received any part of the £7.5m fees.”\nTughans said it disagreed with Coulter’s “version of events surrounding the treatment, discovery and retrieval of the professional fees and his exit from the practice”.\nIt said it had passed all documentation relating to this to the Law Society of Northern Ireland. “The firm voluntarily brought the matter to the attention of the Law Society and will continue to cooperate with any inquiry,” it said.\nCoulter disputed this, saying the money that was transferred to an external account was not “discovered” or “retrieved” by the Law Society or Tughans during an audit. “In fact, I transferred the money back to Tughans in early December 2014 and I brought this to their attention,” he said.\n“From late November until early January, discussions took place to try to resolve the matter. In January 2015 these discussions broke down and I decided to resign from Tughans. Terms and conditions for my resignation were agreed between me and Tughans.”\n"

        "text": "\nThe Church of England (CoE) has sold its stake in a British oil and gas company over allegations of bribery, corruption and human rights abuses and what it said was the company’s failure to unequivocally rule out drilling for oil in Africa’s oldest national park.\nLondon-listed Soco International has been criticised in the past two years by conservationists including WWF and Sir David Attenborough for its attempt to drill in Virunga in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), which is a world heritage site and home to around half the world’s mountain gorillas. \nThe church was sufficiently alarmed by the allegations that it asked the company to conduct an independent public inquiry into them, but at its recent AGM Soco refused to publish the scope or outcome of the inquiry. \nThat prompted the Church Commissioners, which manage the CoE’s £6.7bn investment fund, to divest their entire £1.6m holding from Soco in what they called a “last resort”. The stake was sold on Friday.\nThe divestment is only the third time in five years that the church has divested from a company on ethical grounds. In 2012 it sold its shares in News Corporation in protest at phone-hacking and in 2010 it sold its holdings in Vedanta Resources over human rights concerns linked with the company’s mining operations India.\n“We have called time because without the changes we sought this is not a sustainable or ethical investment for church funds,” said Edward Mason, head of responsible investment at the Church Commissioners. “We take engagement with companies very seriously. In this instance Soco has not responded positively or sincerely to the concerns we raised.”\nAdam Matthews of the church’s ethical investment advisory group said they started engaging with Soco over their concerns in 2013, and intensely since late 2014 after a Congolese military official linked to the company was apparently filmed offering a bribe to opponents, and a park ranger was assaulted by soldiers after trying to stop Soco erecting a mast in the park.\n“These are really serious events. There’s no evidence it was directly committed by the company, but it was associated with its activities,” said Mason. “It was the human rights, bribery and corruption angles which really concerned us. It was [until recently] a FTSE350 company, it’s a significant British company.”\nThe church outlined four main areas of concern: the failure to publish an independent inquiry into the human rights abuse allegations or adopt best practice environmental and social standards; concerns over the independence of the board and chairman; and a failure to explicitly rule out future drilling if the park’s boundaries changed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Virunga national park is home to around half of the world’s remaining mountain gorillas. Photograph: Brent Stirton/WWF-Canon/Getty Images\n\n\nSoco reached an agreement last summer with WWF to rule out exploration within the park, but critics have since raised concerns that the company has not ruled out exploration if the boundary changes. The DRC’s prime minister has said he wants to allow oil exploration in the park and has said, “Soco had brought the issue of the boundary to the government’s attention.”\nAny boundary changes to Virunga national park are likely to spark a strong response from Unesco, which says exploitation of oil is incompatible with the world heritage site status and declassifying parts of the park to allow drilling would be “a major modification”.\nSince its agreement with WWF last summer, Soco has repeatedly said it would not drill within the park and is not lobbying for boundary changes. In March, it said it no longer had any personnel in block V, the area around Lake Edward where it has a license to explore and where it undertook seismic tests in 2014. “After providing the DRC government with interpretation of the seismic results, Soco will have no further involvement in the block,” it said.\nBut Matthews said that the company’s position on future boundary changes is ambiguous: “We still feel there’s that element of doubt in the statements they’ve made.”\nHe added: “We were seeking assurances that in absolutely no circumstances could there by any consideration given to them going back into the park under different boundaries,” and such assurances had not been forthcoming, he said.\nEmmanuel de Merode, the Belgian director of Virunga national park, said: “We share the deep concern shown by the Church of England that Soco International has failed to adequately investigate these allegations internally. Given the very serious nature of the allegations it is incumbent on all relevant jurisdictions, including the UK, to ensure appropriate action is taken”.\n\n\n"

Chasing one last big payday, the biggest beasts in the Fifa jungle finally over-reached themselves.\nEven as bidding teams trooped home dejectedly, leaving behind piles of pointless, unread bid books, there were dark rumours of secret meetings in the five star hotels in the hills above Zurich, of trade pacts and done deals.\nYet scanning the press the day after the decision, it is striking just how much space is devoted to the naive outrage of the England bid team who had just squandered £21m – “They looked us in the eye and lied!” – and how little to the jaw-dropping decision to take the World Cup to Qatar.\nThat would all change. First came confirmation of the sheer scale of the machine that secured Qatar’s victory – the millions lavished upon ambassadors like Zinedine Zidane and Pep Guardiola, the high-level trade talks, the low-level land deals, the network of Aspire Academies, the construction contracts.\nThen came the rumours, hotly denied, of bribery and corruption. Then the focus on the extreme heat in which the tournament was scheduled to be played and the machinations over moving the tournament to December. Finally, shamefully, the outrage and pressure over the hundreds of migrant workers dying in the desert to build the infrastructure to host a World Cup.\nIt was the vote for Qatar that emboldened Mohamed bin Hammam, the Qatari Fifa executive committee member who helped deliver victory, to launch a tilt at Blatter’s presidency after being frustrated by the incumbent’s failure to keep his promise to step aside in 2011.\nBlatter, by then used to thinking two or three steps ahead and using the machinery of the Fifa presidential office to extinguish threats to his power, moved to see off Bin Hammam.\nChuck Blazer, the American exco member who we now know would shortly turn FBI informant after being pursued by tax authorities over huge debts relating to the sums he had extracted from TV and marketing deals, turned on his Concacaf colleague Jack Warner and brought down the Qatari. But in the process, he would eventually spark an existential crisis for Fifa.\nThe FBI indictment laid bare the extent to which two generations of football officials in the US and South America skimmed up to $150m from marketing and television deals over 25 years in what amounted to a “World Cup of fraud”. In the fallout, practically every presidential race and World Cup bidding scramble during that period has come under scrutiny.\nQatar’s triumph was also a victory for Michel Platini, who helped orchestrate its success and was open about his own vote, and a boost to his own clout within the Tudor star chamber of Fifa’s executive committee.\nLess than a month later, he was to be found holding court with reporters at Uefa’s lakeside HQ, pondering whether the tournament should be moved to winter and shared with the rest of the Gulf.\nAnd three months later still, before Uefa’s congress in Paris, an emboldened Platini would agree the fateful deal with Blatter that would see him claim the £1.3m he believed he was owed under the terms of an earlier agreement and sow the seeds of their potential mutual demise.\nAnd as the US delegation, including Bill Clinton, trooped home in disappointment their sense of burning injustice also played into the establishment support for an FBI investigation that would follow in short order and ultimately led to the dramatic arrests in the very same Baur au Lac hotel where bid teams had frantically, pointlessly tried to woo voters on the night before the vote.\nFrank Lowy, the chairman of Football Federation Australia, was furious at Australia’s single vote garnered following a campaign that cost AUS$46m (£22.3m) of public money, and would spend much of the next few years furiously instructing private investigators.\nAnd the vote would also signal a turning point in public perception, in which a shrug of the shoulders started to be replaced by anger. Even those of us who agree that there is a compelling case for a World Cup in the Middle East are equally convinced this was the wrong way to get there.\nThere are just as many question marks over Russia’s victory – the rented computers, later destroyed, that were dismissively offered up to investigator Michael Garcia to answer allegations of impropriety as exhibit A – but it was the fateful decision to strike out for Qatar that sent things spinning out of control.\nPerhaps Blatter, who insists he voted for the USA, knew it and that is why he wears a grimace more than a grin as he opens Qatar’s envelope.\nHe now says there was broad agreement between Fifa’s senior powerbrokers to take the World Cup to Russia then the USA, but that Platini upset their plans. Almost immediately, Blatter was on a private plane to visit the Emir to try and smooth things over. But he knew it was a decision that would come back to bite him and Fifa.\nBefore 2 December 2010, much of the evidence against Fifa’s mafia-like structure was hiding in plain sight thanks to the diligence of a handful of investigative journalists and the odd chink of light such as the $100m ISL bribery affair. But the omertà stayed strong.\nSuch were the forces unleashed by the ill starred dual bidding race that it would not hold another five years, as the once all-powerful masters of Fifa’s universe were targeted from without, as an emboldened FBI set about its work, and within, as they began to bring one another crashing down.\nNow Blatter and Platini stand on the brink of lifetime bans and the majority of those 22 voters who made the decision are either disgraced, deposed or dead. Fifa’s downfall is complete, and the diligent administrators who work there must hope that something new can emerge from the burning wreckage.\nAnd yet scanning the list of candidates to replace Blatter at February’s special congress – to be discussed at Wednesday’s executive committee meeting along with the two upcoming World Cups and reform plans put forward by a committee populated by its own executives – it is hard to be too optimistic about what comes next.\n"

        "text": "\nAn international subsidiary of Compass Group, the British catering giant that supplies more than 1,500 UK primary schools and 30 NHS Trusts, paid bribes to government officials in Kazakhstan, documents seen by the Guardian reveal.\nTheunit’s agents made “facilitation payments” to customs officers in the former Soviet republic for an unspecified period up to 2011, internal Compass papers show, with the transactions originating in the same international division that was separately accused of bribing a UN official to win contracts.\nThe company paid £40m to settle civil litigation in the UN case in 2006, without admitting legal liability.\nThe new allegations are detailed in documents that relate to an employment tribunal claim brought by a former finance director of a Compass subsidiary in Kazakhstan. Karim Pabani says he was sacked after blowing the whistle on corruption, but Compass is fighting the claim.\nPabani, who joined ESS Support Services in August 2011, alleges in his tribunal witness statement that “a Compass Kazakhstan staff member was routinely given cash advances to make bribes to government officials”.\nSeparate internal emails, seen by the Guardian, show the same employee asking the company for a personal loan. The email chain suggests the request was initially questioned because the employee already owed the company money, but it was eventually approved in 2012 after she was awarded a bonus to help repay the outstanding sum.\nCompass has yet to respond in detail to Pabani’s employment tribunal claims, but a spokesman for the caterer said: “Compass is vigorously defending these allegations, but as the matter is subject to ongoing legal proceedings we are not able to comment further at this time.”\nOne Compass document, however, which was co-authored in September 2013 by the group’s human resources director, Jane Kingston, and its general counsel, Mark White, admits: “As part of the Group’s implementation of adequate procedures to prevent bribery and corruption in the business and in order to create a defence under the Bribery Act 2010, a Group-wide roll-out of the Code of Business Conduct had begun in February 2011 and before the 2010 Act came into force.\n“As part of the roll-out, the Group became aware of small facilitation payments being made through the freight forwarders in Kazakhstan in order to release goods from customs and immediately required the practice to stop. The position was closely followed up in order to ensure that the practice had indeed stopped.”\nThe Serious Fraud Office (SFO) defines a facilitation payment as “a type of bribe and should be seen as such. A common example is where a government official is given money or goods to perform [or speed up the performance of] an existing duty. Facilitation payments were illegal before the Bribery Act came into force and they are illegal under the Bribery Act, regardless of their size or frequency”.\nLawyers said that facilitation payments, sometimes referred to as “speed” or “grease” payments, were previously outlawed under the Public Bodies Corrupt Practices Act 1889, as well as via the common law offence of bribery.\nCompass declined to say if it had reported the facilitation payments to any law-enforcement authority, or if there had been any legal censure on the company. It has made no public statement on the payments, but in a letter to Pabani explaining his sacking, the company said the facilitation payments were already known about and had been dealt with before his arrival in post.\nAlison Geary, a white collar crime specialist at the law firm WilmerHale, said: “In order to come within the reach of the Bribery Act a company must be carrying on business in the UK. However, a UK company can be found liable for the acts of its foreign subsidiaries if the foreign subsidiary was performing services for the UK company. It is an offence under the Bribery Act to make a payment to a foreign official or a third party that is not legitimately due in order to influence that foreign official.”\nAny decision over SFO prosecutions for the making of facilitation payments is covered by the code for crown prosecutors, and the joint prosecution guidance of the SFO’s director and the director of public prosecutions.\nFactors tending in favour of a prosecution include “payments that are planned for or accepted as part of a standard way of conducting business”. Those tending against include payments that come to light “as a result of a genuinely proactive approach involving self-reporting and remedial action”, such as the approach Compass explained in the letter detailing its reasons for dismissing Pabani.\nCompass’s code of business conduct states: “The giving of facilitation payments by Compass employees is prohibited. You should not make such payments, even if they are for nominal amounts or are ‘normal’ practice in the country in which you operate.”\nThe company said it was “committed to setting the highest standards for responsible business practice, which is underpinned by a global framework of policies and measures and is supported by comprehensive communications and training”. \nIt also said that “investigations carried out in respect of the UN issues in 2005 gave no reason to believe that the issues extended beyond a few individuals within ESS to other parts of ESS or the wider Compass group of companies.”\n"

        "text": "\nAs an illustration of how the notion of a “bonus” – in the sense of a reward for exceptional achievement – has been debased by modern boardroom pay practices, look no further than Morrisons, whose shareholders gather in Bradford on Thursday.\nAt least a few investors, contemplating a share price that has almost halved over three years, will want an answer to a simple question: if Dalton Philips’ shift as chief executive was so disappointing that he had to be replaced, why was he awarded a £1m bonus for his last year in the job?\nNobody should quibble with the salary-and pension-related elements of Philips’ pay-off. Directors’ contracts are clear in those areas: the employer must pay up. The sole contentious part is the bonus.\nOne assumes Johanna Waterous, head of Morrisons’ pay committee, will fall back on the explanation she gave in the annual report: the business achieved “a substantial portion” of its objectives for the year. On the key measures of underlying profits, cash flow, quality of online service and cost savings, Morrisons hit the targets. Thus Philips qualified for 60% of his maximum bonus.\n\n\n\n\nManagers’ rich rewards for poor performance | Letter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut this is perverse. Philips lost his job – new chairman Andrew Higginson recruited David Potts, an old Tesco comrade – because Morrisons’ like-for-like sales figures were so dismal. That can happen despite profits and cash flow being deemed officially adequate. But it demonstrates, surely, that the incentive system was flawed in the first place. What’s the point of offering £1m to hit four targets if failure to achieve a fifth is so serious that a more dynamic boss has to be summoned?\nOne can’t blame Philips for accepting his bonus. It wasn’t his fault that the pay committee designed such a poor incentive scheme; he played by the rules. But Waterous owes Morrisons’ shareholders a better explanation than her watery offering in the annual report.\nStill early days for AO World \nOptimism is the default setting for John Roberts, founder of AO World, so shareholders had to plough through more than a few boasts about “unbeatable prices” and “amazing service” to be reminded of what they already knew: that the fridges-to-TVs online retailer missed its financial targets for the year.\nFebruary’s profits warning, blamed curiously on a falling-off in publicity after last year’s flotation, remains fresh in the memory. So, too, does chairman Richard Rose’s £10m sale of the bulk of his shareholding soon after the warning. In short, sceptics wonder whether AO’s hype about “changing the way Europe buys its electricals” is running several laps ahead of reality.\nTuesday’s figures met February’s lowered expectations but Roberts’ admission that the UK trading environment remains “challenging” will do nothing to calm nerves. There is a suspicion that the problem isn’t so much the retail climate, where disposable incomes are improving in the UK, but stiffer online competition from the likes of Dixons Carphone.\nAO could still boast a 22% rise in UK revenues to £471m and a 47% improvement in UK top-line profits to £11.2m for the financial year. That’s not to be sniffed at. But, if you want to believe that AO is a revolutionary company, you have to think pan-European success will come quickly and confidently. In fact, it’s far too early to tell: revenues in Germany, the first new market, were only £5.8m in the first six months of trading there.\nGerman start-up losses and set-up costs, plus £2.5m of incentive rewards for executives, meant AO recorded a pre-tax loss of £2.9m for the year. The share price has descended from 285p at float to 170p, making the equity worth £715m, but that still looks a rich valuation. Flogging fridges and freezers will always be a low-margin activity and it will be at least two years before the success of the German adventure, and any others, can be assessed properly. Too many questions, too few answers.\nFifa sponsors bear some blame\nSepp Blatter’s resignation as the president of Fifa deprives the sponsors of their last opportunity to salvage a scrap of respectability by demanding that he goes. The mealy-mouthed, and inadequate, protestations of “concern” in recent days from the likes of Visa, Coca-Cola, Adidas, McDonald’s and Anheuser-Busch have been a depressing sub-plot to the allegations of bribery and corruption at Fifa.\nThese corporate titans have been able for years to demand that world football’s governing body undergoes root-and-branch reform under a new president. Even after the crisis erupted, they flunked it. They chose timid words over taking a stand. If a consumer backlash follows, the sponsors will get what they deserve.\n"

Instead, they corrupted the business of worldwide soccer to serve their interests and enrich themselves.”\nLynch said the nine Fifa officials, including former Fifa vice-president Jack Warner, and five sports marketing executives had run “a 24-year scheme to enrich themselves through the corruption of international soccer”.\nShe alleged that the bribery and corruption extended from the sale of TV rights to voting for which countries should be awarded the right to hold the World Cup and other tournaments. \n“These individuals and organizations engaged in bribery to decide who would televise games; where the games would be held; and who would run the organization overseeing organized soccer worldwide,” Lynch said.\n“They corrupted the business of worldwide soccer to serve their interests and enrich themselves. They did this over and over, year after year, tournament after tournament.”\n\n\n\n\nThe Fifa fiasco proves it’s time to dismantle football’s edifice of corruption | David Goldblatt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLynch said she would seek the extradition of the men to the US to stand trial as soon as possible. If found guilty of racketeering, the most serious of the 47 charges, some of the men face up to 20 years in jail. \nShe refused to comment on whether Sepp Blatter, the current president of Fifa who is seeking re-election for a fifth term on Friday, would be subject to the far-reaching and ongoing investigation.\nLynch said Fifa would need to consider whether the World Cups in Russia in 2018 and Qatar in 2022, which have long been plagued with allegations of fraud, should go ahead as planned. \nKelly Curries, the acting US attorney for the eastern district of New York, said: “This is the beginning of our effort, not the end. We are looking into individuals and entities in a variety of countries.” There are 25 unnamed co-conspirators mentioned in the indictment, including people linked to the South Africa 2010 World Cup bid committee. \nThe charges were announced at a press conference in New York on Wednesday hosted by Lynch, who was flanked by senior officials from the FBI and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) criminal investigations unit. \nRichard Weber, the chief investigator of the IRS criminal investigations unit, said: “This is really the World Cup of fraud and today we are issuing Fifa a red card,” adding: “The fans shouldn’t have to worry about officials corrupting their sport.”\nJames Comey, the director of the FBI, said the game had been “hijacked by corruption”. \nThe current or former Fifa officials charged are Eduardo Li, Jeffrey Webb, Eugenio Figueredo, Jack Warner, Julio Rocha, Costas Takkas, Rafael Esquivel, José Maria Marin and Nicolás Leoz. Warner and Leoz were not among those arrested in Switzerland; Leoz resigned as president of the South American Football Confederation in 2013, while Warner stood down from all international football positions in 2011.\n"

        "text": "\nThe relationship between retailers and their suppliers is to be scrutinised in the wake of the Tesco accounting scandal – in which the group overstated last year’s expected first-half profits by about £250m.\nThe Financial Reporting Council (FRC), the UK’s auditing and accountancy watchdog, plans to make food retailing a priority sector for audit inspections this year.\nThe FRC will “pay particular attention to the audit of revenue recognition and complex supplier arrangements” at food, drink and consumer goods manufacturers, as well as retailers. \nThe ramp-up in regulatory activity comes after Tesco admitted it had artificially inflated profits by more than £263m as a result of the misstatement of payments from suppliers. \nThe matter is currently being investigated by the Serious Fraud Office (SFO), the grocery market watchdog – the Groceries Code Adjudicator – and the FRC.\n\n\n\n\nTesco relegated from premier league of global brands after nightmare year\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPaul George, the FRC’s executive director of conduct, said: “Events at Tesco did raise awareness of this issue but [the new regulatory focus] wasn’t only as a result of Tesco.\n“We have been seeing over a period of time the complexity in arrangements between suppliers and their customers increasing.”\nHe said there were accounting and audit risks involved when relationships between suppliers and their clients evolved over time and this was not reflected in their original contracts.\n“More transparency is a good thing,” George said.\nA “significant proportion” of the 140 audits the FRC plans to inspect this year will be retailers and their suppliers, alongside other priority sectors including insurance, business services and companies servicing mining and oil companies, according to the body’s annual report, which is published on Friday.\nThe retail inspections will be separate from the FRC’s investigation into Tesco’s former auditor PwC and individuals within the retailer, in relation to the preparation, approval and audit of accounts going back to February 2012.\nGeorge said he could not indicate when that investigation would be concluded.\nPwC, which was ousted as Tesco’s auditor this year, and individual chartered accountants working for the supermarket could potentially face unlimited fines, legal costs and exclusion from the profession if the accountancy watchdog finds evidence of misconduct.\nTesco has said it is cooperating fully with all the investigations it is facing. On Thursday, that led to speculation that the supermarket could be one of the first companies in the UK to strike a new type of deal with the SFO which would enable it to avoid a criminal prosecution.\nUnder new powers introduced last year, the SFO can offer a “deferred prosecution agreement” (DPA), a deal requiring high court approval, which includes fines and other undertakings if that is considered to be in the public interest and a company cooperates. \nA DPA deal does not protect individuals who might face criminal charges with the help of evidence provided by the company.\nIn a speech last week, Ben Morgan, the SFO’s joint head of bribery and corruption, said the watchdog had handed out its first invitation letters for companies to enter into DPA negotiations.\n Tesco and the SFO declined to comment on whether Tesco was among the companies to have been sent a letter.\nHowever, lawyers said such a deal could appeal to Tesco because it could bring about a settlement within months rather than the three to five years that a full SFO investigation entails.\n“A DPA deal could bring about a much swifter resolution for Tesco,” said Robert Amaee, a partner at law firm Covington and the former head of anti-corruption at the SFO.\n “If Tesco is one of the companies in settlement discussions with the SFO, it will have provided the SFO with evidence against senior individuals implicated in any alleged wrongdoing,” he added.\nMeanwhile, Tesco’s historic accountancy problems were highlighted again on Thursday when a US law firm said it had signed up a number of British institutional investors to pursue compensation for losses relating to the supermarket’s profits overstatement.\nTesco Shareholder Claims, which is supported by US law firm Scott and Scott, said it had also hired barrister Philip Marshall QC, one of the lawyers who acted for Paddy McKillen in his fight over Claridge’s hotel with the Barclay brothers. \nThe group said that, following advice from Marshall, it was “already clear that the case against Tesco is strong and will involve a substantial claim”.\nIn Tesco’s annual report released last week, the company said any legal action resulting from the SFO investigation or from legal action by shareholders “could have a material and adverse impact on the group’s financial condition”.\n"

        "text": "\nIs the over-riding principle of our times that bad behaviour drives out good? The assertion of self-interest and the pursuit of profit, by fair means or foul, trumps everything. Great values are under assault. Whether nobility of purpose, behaving with integrity, looking out for others, accepting responsibility or just doing the right thing – all seem to be withering on the vine.\n\n\n\n\nBlatter accuses US authorities and British press of campaign to topple him\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmblematic of the age was the action of 133 leaders of world football associations tamely re-electing Sepp Blatter for a fifth term as president of Fifa. This came after the arrest (at the request of the US) earlier in the week at a luxury Zurich hotel of seven of its key officials, suspected of receiving more than $100m in bribes. True, there were 73 football associations who voted against him, the president of Uefa, Michel Platini, called for his resignation and the big multinationals sponsoring Fifa events, notably the World Cup, threatened to review their contracts. But Blatter has been here before. He knows that, whatever the muttering, veiled threats and calls for his resignation, nobody has yet had the will to act. Money will rule, publicly and privately.\nAfter all, none of this is a surprise, despite the way it was reported: everyone around Fifa has known the stakes and the likelihood of arrests for at least six months. Even the Swiss raid on Fifa’s HQ last week, opening Swiss criminal proceedings against “persons unknown”, independent of the US inquiry, was another predictable action.\nIn 2012, Blatter appointed a former German judge, Hans-Joachim Eckert, as chair of Fifa’s ethics committee, and former US attorney for the southern district of New York, Michael Garcia, to lead its investigative wing. Garcia had a mandate to investigate both current and past malpractices, notably the charges of bribery and corruption surrounding the allocation of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to Russia and Qatar. It was the minimum Blatter could do given the mounting evidence of corruption, but as we now know he never intended the investigation to go far.\nGarcia in good faith duly delivered his report last September. Amazingly, both Eckert and Blatter then refused to publish it or to pass it to investigative authorities in Switzerland, the US and the other countries involved. Instead, last November, a highly selective executive summary was released, exonerating Qatar and Russia and raising questions about the behaviour of the Australian and English football associations in the bidding process. Also, Fifa made a minimal complaint to the Swiss authorities about the “possible misconduct” of some “individual persons” with regard to the “international transfer of assets with connections to Switzerland”.\nGarcia protested fiercely. The summary was “materially incomplete”, he said, with “erroneous representations of the facts and conclusions”. In December he resigned, citing lack of leadership in Fifa and his loss of confidence in the ethics committee being truly independent of Blatter. Essentially he had been stitched up.\nThroughout those weeks last autumn, the big six corporate sponsors repeated the mantra of last week: football and Fifa had to clean up their act. The German FA warned that Uefa might leave Fifa if the report was not published in full. Richard Scudamore, CEO of the Premier League, echoed the refrain. Others on Fifa’s executive committee called for publication. They were fobbed off with the line that the report could be published only after the Swiss authorities had concluded their investigations, which could take years.\nMeanwhile, Blatter confirmed that the World Cup would be held in Russia and then Qatar, insisted on his commitment to ethics and carried on garnering the votes from Africa, Latin American and the Caribbean that would ensure his re-election. But while he sailed on regardless, the US attorney general’s office continued its investigations, helped no doubt by the Garcia report. Hence the inevitable arrests.\nUnder different leadership, the published report could have triggered global action against corruption in football. Fifa’s governing processes should have been overhauled from top to bottom. There should be term limits on executives, transparency in the bidding process to host tournaments and proper checks and balances. None of this happened and the author of the inactivity has now been re-elected president. It is breathtaking hypocrisy and a global signal that bad behaviour pays off.\nWhich is why European football authorities, western broadcasters and corporate sponsors must now react firmly and decisively, as they should have done over the past six months, so ending Blatter’s candidacy. This cannot be ducked and left to the US attorney-general or the tepid efforts of the Swiss. Uefa members should now declare they will not play at the 2018 and 2022 World Cups unless Blatter resigns, the Garcia report is published and a successor commits to fundamental reform of Fifa. Moreover, they should propose to hold a tournament at the same time as the scheduled World Cup.\n\n\nBut such a coalition is almost impossible to build. Money rules. The sponsorship deals run to hundreds of millions, the broadcast rights to billions. Companies are being asked to put profit at risk for the apparently nebulous gain of endorsing good values.\nPart of the problem is that values are seen as soft and upholding them is someone else’s responsibility. Tackling corruption, as the free market economists have told us, will be done through the price mechanism exacting a penalty if it becomes too pervasive or it’s the responsibility of the police. The job of market participants – whether players, clubs, broadcasters or sponsor companies – is just to follow the money. They can be value-free and indifferent to the moral and social consequences of their actions.\nOne of the more encouraging developments last week was that one company – Visa – was prepared to declare independence from that mindset. More need to join it. Durable capitalism, in football as elsewhere, cannot abandon principles of integrity, fair play and awareness of the profound social and moral dimensions that its actions have on others. Indeed, the best capitalism is rooted in the recognition that it has a moral and social purpose. (It would be good to see the candidates for the Labour leadership show they understand this as they rush to prove their pro-business credentials.) Blatter and his supporters think otherwise: that capitalism’s values are those of the souk or the casino, that football is no different and that the west is hypocritical to proclaim otherwise. It is a sacred duty to prove him wrong.\n\n• Comments wil be opened later today\n"

        "text": "\nFifa’s lavish £150m headquarters in the hills above Zurich has been so often described as a Bond villain’s lair that the comparison has long since passed into cliche. But never has it been more appropriate than yesterday, when a self-pitying Sepp Blatter spent the morning holed up in his office receiving a string of visitors as he tried to plot a way out of the worst crisis of his 17-year tenure as president.\nNaturally, his scheming concerned his personal survival in a role that carries with it an estimated $10m (£6.5m)salary and all the trappings of a head of state, rather than the future of his tattered and discredited governing body.\nMichel Platini, the Uefa president who backed Blatter’s first campaign in 1998 and became the first in a succession of favoured then spurned potential successors, delivered a tear-stained plea to Blatter to go before today’s election. Naturally, he refused. Uefa itself is no paragon of virtue and the European game is too often perceived as a hectoring bully by the rest of the world. It needs to become part of the solution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Michel Platini expresses his disgust at Fifa, stating ‘enough is enough’\n\n\nFor never has an organisation become more inured to scandal than Fifa. From the 1998 election that brought Blatter to power, to the ISL scandal in which $100m in kickbacks were paid to senior executives, and the complex, controversial and chaotic race for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, Blatter has reflexively learned to shrug off corruption on a scale that would sink the leader of any other organisation.\nDown the years he has managed to successfully play off against one another a combustible mix of rogues and created a system that effectively allowed them to act with impunity in their own backyards using the power and privilege granted to them by their position. He has also learned to maintain the appearance of keeping his own hands clean. Down his 40 years he has regularly heard the shattering of broken glass but rarely been caught casting the stone. Never ask, never explain.\nEven when he has been caught out – such as when he handled a $1m bribe meant for his mentor Havelange that was part of the web of $100m ISL kickbacks – he has managed to obfuscate and delay, using the Swiss legal system to his benefit. No longer. All those charged by the US Department of Justice on Wednesday have close links to Blatter and find themselves at the mercy of a suddenly emboldened Swiss prosecutor.\nFifa has tried to sing the old songs, shielding its leader from complicity. Blatter, too, when he finally emerged from crisis talks in his bunker to walk past the police vans parked outside the conference centre and deliver a predictably mendacious promise to change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Sepp Blatter addresses delegates during the opening ceremony of the 65th Fifa congress on Thursday\n\n\nIn his opening speech, he admitted the current situation was “unprecedented”. Back in 2011, when allegations of bribery and corruption again swirled around Zurich, he said: “We will put Fifa’s ship back on the right course in clear, transparent waters.” But four years on, with the situation so much more serious given the might of the US justice system ranged against him and some of those with whom he has been so closely entwined down the years facing extradition and FBI interrogation, the ship is nearly sunk.\nOn Friday he will promise to share Fifa’s World Cup bounty with its 209 members, skimming over the fact that it spends as much on salaries, protocol and other operating expenses as it does on football development.\nLooking at the US charge sheet and considering what we now know about the 2018/22 World Cup race, together with the grim history outlined by investigative reporters down the years, a familiar thought resurfaces. Given all that has happened on his watch, Blatter is either corrupt or incompetent.\nThere is already a rush to proclaim the US case against Fifa and the culture of cosy kickbacks and patronage minted by Havelange and developed by Blatter during a period when World Cup income rocketed as world football’s “Salt Lake City moment”.\nBut that reference to the investigation into the grubby world of graft that characterised the bidding process for the 2002 Winter Olympics and led to a clean-up at the International Olympic Committee was not the point when its image began to improve. That was when its president Juan Antonio Samaranch finally left office. It is time Blatter finally looked in the mirror and did the same. For the game, for the world.\n"

        "text": "\nBritish overseas tax havens play a key role in what US authorities have called “rampant, systemic and deep-rooted” corruption in the world of football, analysis by the Observer reveals.\nThe 164-page US Department of Justice indictment, outlining the case against the 14 football officials and marketing executives who were arrested last week, shows that three of Britain’s overseas territories – the British Virgin Islands (BVI), the Cayman Islands and the Turks and Caicos, all tax havens – allegedly played a part in masking kickbacks between officials and executives.\nThe revelation has intensified calls for a clampdown on the offshore banking sector, where campaigners say a lack of transparency and oversight allows bribery and corruption to thrive.\nAccording to the indictment, Costas Takkas, a UK citizen who acted as attaché to Fifa’s vice-president, Jeffrey Webb, used a firm called Kosson Ventures, registered in the BVI and with bank accounts in the Cayman Islands, to allegedly facilitate illegal payments between a South American sports marketing agency, Traffic, and Fifa officials.\nJohn Mann, a Labour MP and Treasury select committee member, said the use of British tax havens made investigating the scandal all the more difficult: “The problem is that the Serious Fraud Office here can’t investigate these tax havens, and that anomaly needs rectifying. They are centres for money laundering in a very big way. We are negotiating to change relations with the European Union, but we should spend just as much time renegotiating the deals with the overseas territories. They are becoming a serious problem for the world.”\nThe indictment raises questions about whether the banks in the tax havens should have flagged the transactions to the authorities as a potential concern. The indictment states: “On or about November 21, 2012, two wire transfers, of $750,000 and $250,000, were sent from Front Company A’s account at HSBC bank in Hong Kong to a correspondent account at Standard Chartered Bank in New York for credit to an account in the name of Kosson Ventures, controlled by Takkas, at Fidelity Bank in the Cayman Islands”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Providenciales island in the Turks and Caicos. Photograph: Hemis /Alamy\n\n\nA $500,000 payment to Webb was made by Traffic “through the account of another individual, a business associate of Co-Conspirator #2, to another account controlled by the defendant Costas Takkas at Fidelity Bank in the Cayman Islands”.\nAnother defendant, marketing executive Jose Margulies, had a controlling stake in a firm called Somerton, based in the Turks and Caicos. According to the indictment, Margulies used the accounts of Somerton and a Panama-based firm – referred to by the US authorities as “Margulies Intermediaries” – to “mask the sources and beneficiaries of bribe and kickback payments”. Between March 2003 and March 2008, “Margulies Intermediaries wired more than $3.5m into accounts controlled by the defendants Rafael Esquivel [president of the Venezuelan football federation], Nicolás Leoz [former president of South America’s football confederation] and Eugenio Figueredo [head of Conmebol, the South American football confederation], almost entirely through even, six-figure payments”.\nRobert Palmer, head of Global Witness’s money laundering campaign, said: “If you wanted to design a system to weed out corrupt and laundered money, you would do it exactly opposite to the way places like the BVI and Cayman Islands are set up. They may have a veneer of light-touch ‘regulation’, but secrecy is hardwired into their DNA and it can be almost impossible to get information out of these islands.”\nThe use of the Cayman Islands to facilitate the allegedly corrupt transactions appears to have been longstanding. The indictment states that, in 1999, “Traffic caused $200,000 to be wired to a correspondent account at Barclays Bank in New York, for credit to an account held in the name of an entity controlled by Co-Conspirator #1 at Barclays Bank in the Cayman Islands.”\nIn 2012 Webb emerged as a candidate to succeed Jack Warner as president of Concacaf, the federation representing the North and Central American and Caribbean footballing nations. According to the US authorities, “an executive at Traffic USA supported Webb’s candidacy by causing $50,000 to be paid from Traffic USA’s operating account to a Caymanian company” controlled by Takkas.\nSome of the money channelled through Britain’s tax havens was allegedly funnelled into property. Takkas transferred funds from his Kosson Ventures account at Fidelity Bank in the Cayman Islands to SunTrust Bank in the US, allegedly to help Webb buy luxury homes in Stone Mountain, Georgia. The use of Kosson Ventures in the scheme was “intended to conceal the fact that the defendant Jeffrey Webb was the beneficiary of the payment”, according to the US prosecutors.\nThe Cayman Islands also played a role in a bribery scheme to allegedly persuade Fifa officials to vote for the 2010 World Cup to be held in South Africa. Warner is alleged to have promised one official $1m in return for his backing South Africa. It is claimed that “the first payment in the amount of $298,500 was made by wire transfer sent on or about December 19, 2008 … to a Bank of America correspondent account in New York, New York, for credit to an account controlled by Co-Conspirator #1 at a bank in the Cayman Islands”.\nExperts said the use of offshore accounts to facilitate corruption hit poor nations hardest. Joseph Stead, economic justice adviser at Christian Aid, said the government needed to send a consistent message. “The UK government has rightly urged Fifa to uphold the ‘highest standards of governance, transparency and accountability’, but this would carry more weight if the UK required the same of its overseas territories. It should start by ensuring that they make public the owners of the hundreds of thousands of companies they host. This would help remove the opportunity for those tempted to engage in corruption and tax evasion.”\n"

        "text": "\nAustralia does not expect Indonesia will move to execute the convicted drug smugglers Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran until every legal avenue has been exhausted, Julie Bishop, the foreign minister in Canberra, has said.\nThe pair have been transferred to Nusa Kambangan, known as “execution island”, along with eight other drug offenders but the date they will face the firing squad is yet to be set.\nBishop said she had meanwhile been in “constant” contact with her Indonesian counterpart. “We are awaiting the outcome of the legal proceedings. There are two legal avenues on foot at present. One is an appeal against the final rejection of the clemency plea,” she said.\nWhen asked by reporters on Sunday if there was anything more Australia could do to stop the executions, Bishop added: “I understand there are also judicial commission hearings in relation to allegations of bribery and corruption at the original trial of Mr Sukumaran and Mr Chan. \n“I understand those matters are proceeding so I cannot imagine that further plans for the execution of these two Australian citizens would be proceeding while there are legal options still being pursued.\n“I believe it would be unthinkable for planning to proceed for these executions while there were still legal avenues open.”\nChan and Sukumaran were sentenced to death over their part in an operation to smuggle heroin out of Indonesia in 2005.\nThe Labor opposition’s foreign affairs spokeswoman, Tanya Plibersek, suggested the Liberal government’s policy of turning back people-smuggling boats had strained the relationship so much Indonesia was unlikely to relent. Tony Abbott, the prime minister, dismissed this as “loose and irresponsible talk from the Labor party” when questioned about it on Sunday.\n“The relationship with Indonesia is strong. It’s at least as strong under this government as the former government, which you might remember put the sugar on the table when it came to people-smugglers and [those are] President [Joko] Widodo’s words,” Tony Abbott said.\n“I say that the relationship with Indonesia is at least as strong today as it was under the former government. The fact that the people smuggling trade has all but shut because of the policies of this government is one of the reasons why the relationship is stronger today, because there isn’t that irritant in the relationship that existed for about five years under the former government.” \nBut Abbott also said on Sunday that it was currently a case of “the less said the better” if Australia wanted to save Chan and Sukumaran – emphasising the political delicacy of the situation and its relationship to the pair’s fate.\nThis was underscored by Bishop. “I think we should all be careful with the commentary that we undertake in relation to this,” she told reporters in Perth. \nPrevious remarks by Abbott, including linking calls for clemency to Australia’s support for Indonesia in past natural disasters, have been seen as damaging to their cause.\nAbbott has requested a phone call with Widodo but it has so far gone unanswered.\n“I have raised the question of the Bali Nine and the two Australians on death row with the president on a number of occasions and we had a phone call about a fortnight ago that was specifically on this subject and I made the Australian position absolutely crystal clear,” he said.\n“He also made the Indonesian position pretty clear as well. He might think that the subject has been well and truly discussed but my request for a phone call stands and it’s up to the Indonesian president to respond.”\n"

        "text": "\nUN secretary general Ban Ki-moon has declared 2015 “the year of sustainability”. With landmark global conferences on sustainable development and climate change ahead, and new UK legislation to tackle modern-day slavery also on its way, this year is set to be pivotal.\n\n\n\n\nAre collaborative projects just a marriage of convenience?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne effect of the global focus on sustainable behaviour will be to stimulate unprecedented demand for hyper-transparent business supply chains. Our experience tells us that ignorance is not bliss: without full transparency it’s impossible to gain an understanding of a business and its impact.\nMany of the core benefits of increased transparency become apparent when its absence is considered. How can you address problems with your goods if you don’t know who is supplying you? How can you prioritise your activities if you aren’t collecting data on how you interact with your customers and suppliers? How can you mitigate risk if you don’t understand what your risks actually are? And how can you encourage trust and transparency within your own supply chain if it transpires that your own processes don’t support your suppliers.\nBy the end of this year we expect many more businesses to realise the many benefits that transparency brings: better procurement decisions, the capacity for innovation and the ability to scale-up good practice. So what progress have they made so far, and what aspirations should they set themselves for the next five years?\nBeyond the first tier\n\n\n\n\nFrom trough to table: mapping the food chain saves lives\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn mapping and understanding supply chain risk, many companies are adopting top-down approaches to responsible management, assessing the performance of first-tier suppliers based on their publicly disclosed data. That’s a logical first step, and it is often where businesses feel they have greatest direct influence. But the biggest sustainability risks often exist further down supply chains.\nSustainable companies are actively seeking transparency at all tiers, from the bottom up. Businesses of all shapes and sizes should follow their lead and aspire to 100% supply chain transparency. This is challenging – but better data gathered from deeper in the supply chain rewards companies with better risk management and more resilient supply chains.\nFrom policy to impact\nA decent set of policies and strategies over how goods are sourced and used is fundamental to improve standards. More companies now disclose details of their policies and management systems, particularly around key risks areas such as bribery and corruption. This disclosure is welcome as it acts as a useful indication of a company’s understanding of its own risks and its level of commitment to tackling them.\nHowever, transparency needs to evolve to also include information about a company’s operations and impact on people and the environment, especially in areas of high risk or sensitivity. This level of disclosure helps companies to meet the expectations of their customers; companies such as Mars, Nestlé and Unilever are leaders in this respect.\n\n\n\n\nBoots 'quietly getting on with' improving impact of Botanics range\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCollaborating for hyper-transparency\nFrom climate change to corruption, and human trafficking to child labour, many of the issues which businesses face in their supply chains are so large and complex that it’s not possible or sensible for them to try to tackle them alone. Modern supply chains continuously evolve; they are huge networks involving many thousands of suppliers across the globe. Shifting trade patterns quickly creates new risk hotspots.\nCollaborative initiates such as Sedex, AIM-progress, and the Bangladesh Accord have helped to boost the availability of supply chain data. Businesses should collaborate to boost that data pool. Only then will they facilitate change at the pace and scale we need.\n• Does your business have an 100% transparent and sustainable supply chain?

        "text": "\nLETTING WIND EROSION, RAIN AND THE NEIGHBOURHOOD CATS DO WHAT WIND EROSION, RAIN AND THE NEIGHBOURHOOD CATS DO\nIt’s never really been clear to the Fiver exactly what is meant by “all football-related activity”. Managing a team, yes. Owning a club, sure. Being involved in any form of governance of the game, absolutely. But where does it stop? Can you have a kickabout in the back garden? Is the odd season of Sensible Soccer allowed? Where does Subbuteo fit in? It’s a minefield. \nAnd stepping into it is Chuck Blazer. The former Fifa executive will be looking over his shoulder nervously whenever he’s tempted into a game of Super Cup Football thanks to a lifetime ban from all football-related activity due to bribery and corruption.\n“Blazer committed many and various acts of misconduct continuously and repeatedly during his time as an official in different high-ranking and influential positions at Fifa and Concacaf,” OMGed Fifa in a statement. “In his positions as a football official, he was a key player in schemes involving the offer, acceptance, payment and receipt of undisclosed and illegal payments, bribes and kickbacks as well as other money-making schemes.”\nSo backslaps all round. Though, given that Blazer pleaded guilty to the FBI and agreed to turn informer, Fifa feeling in any way smug about booting Blazer out of football is rather like congratulating yourself on having cleaned up those baked beans that you spilled on the patio when all you’ve actually done is left them and allowed wind erosion, rain and the neighbourhood’s cats to do what wind erosion, rain and the neighbourhood’s cats do. Those beans? Yeah, sorted them. No more beans on my patio, no sirree. \nBut then what can you do? The world is full of thieves, murderers, murderous thieves and thieving murderers and we can’t catch ’em all. And that’s exactly the same as rampant corruption among members of the Fifa executive committee, isn’t it Uncle Sepp? “It is impossible to stamp out robbery and murder, even with a functioning courts system down to community level,” Blatter told Swiss newspaper Weltwoche. “Football is not better than our society.”\nAnd it’s not like you can hold the president of Fifa responsible for any of this, is it Uncle Sepp? “I not only see everything, I’m responsible for everything, even for the English women’s own goal at the World Cup recently,” he added, introducing sarcasm to his big bag of unpleasant personality traits. “Am I responsible for climate change too?”\nNo, Sepp – you’re responsible for Fifa. Though not for much longer, and for that we can be thankful.\nQUOTE OF THE DAY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Look at him sitting down.

I played for a pub with two teams in different tiers of the local Sunday League. The Division 3 team were in danger of relegation which meant playing with no refs next season, whereas the Division 1 team were safe in mid-table obscurity. So the manager decided to switch our teams for the last two games. I was a Division 3 defender against strikers reported to be semi-pro, and we were losing 30-0 after an hour when the referee called it. The defeat itself didn’t hurt as much as hearing one of them say to his strike partner, ‘It’s like playing Pro-Evo on the PlayStation, with no one else on the other controller’” – Brian Saxby.\n“When did Fabian Delph leave the Villa? Have you been in the Doc’s time machine? Did he go to Manchester City, has he been to any other club before thinking about a return to the Villa? So many questions but if you have been in the Delorean can I have this week’s lotto numbers (normal and Euro) please? (Email it to me direct - I don’t want to share the loot between all 1,057 Fiver readers). Oh, one last thing, did England win the 2022 World Cup? Actually don’t bother answering that” – Ian Henderson (and 1,056 others).\n“Steve Gaw has certainly helped to keep the ‘Kana-based anecdotes’ theme going (Fiver passim) by – deliberately? – incorrectly stating ミルク(milk) as the katakana for ‘hotel’ (or was the Fiver again deliberately altering letters in an attempt at pedant baiting?)

        "text": "\nThree of Fifa’s sponsors during the 2014 World Cup in Brazil have joined Sony and Emirates in declining to renew their contracts with the scandal-hit world governing body.\nCastrol, Continental Tyres and Johnson & Johnson – so-called second-tier sponsors that had a high-profile presence in Brazil – have confirmed they have not renewed their deals.\nThough none linked their decisions to the latest scandals to wash over Fifa following its much-criticised investigation into the controversial bidding race for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, it will increase the pressure on the organisation led by Sepp Blatter.\nAll three confirmed to the Daily Telegraph they had decided not to renew their contracts for a variety of reasons.\nSponsors bring in at least $1.5bn in revenue over each four-year cycle. Continental Tyres had been a World Cup sponsor since 2010, Castrol since 2008 and Johnson & Johnson signed a deal for a single cycle in 2011. Its decision not to renew will increase fears in Zurich that Fifa’s image is becoming unsuitable for global brands and will force its commercial department to look more to regional sponsors to fill the roster.\nIncreasingly, Fifa is likely to look to companies in Russia and the Middle East – the regions that will play host to the next two World Cups – to fill the gap. There are also plans to introduce more regional sponsorship tiers in an attempt to target developing markets.\nThose campaigning for reform at Fifa have long argued it is only through pressure from sponsors and broadcasters, who pour money into its coffers, that enough pressure will build to force fundamental change.\nVisa, Adidas and Sony delivered coded warnings over the bribery and corruption allegations that engulfed Fifa on the eve of the Brazil World Cup, calling on the governing body to ensure the claims were properly investigated.\nIt emerged late last year that Sony and Emirates, two of Fifa’s six top-tier partners, would end their relationships with the governing body, which is hopeful of replacing them with Samsung and Qatar Air respectively.\nAdidas, which has a longstanding close relationship with Fifa and Blatter, recently renewed its sponsorship deal until 2030 while Visa’s contract runs until 2022. Coca-Cola, which became Fifa’s first sponsor in 1978, also has a long-term deal.\nFifa’s top-tier sponsors pay between $24m and $44m a year, while second-tier World Cup sponsors – who also included Budweiser, MTN and McDonalds – pay an estimated $10m to $25m a year.\nLast year Michael Hershman, a former member of Fifa’s independent governance committee and co-founder of Transparency International, criticised sponsors for not stepping up to the plate.\n“They have simply paid lip service,” he said. “Saying in press releases: ‘Oh yes, the sport needs a greater degree of integrity and transparency.’ But they haven’t put their money where their mouth is.”\nIncreasingly, brands have sought to focus on their relationship with the glamour of the World Cup and “fan engagement” campaigns rather than with the tainted Fifa brand. However, confirmation of the latest wave of non-renewals could lead other sponsors to consider their positions.\nFifa’s marketing director, Thierry Weil, told the Guardian on Friday: “Rotations at the end of a sponsorship cycle are commonplace in the sports industry and have continuously occurred since the commercialisation of the World Cup began. It is natural that as brands’ strategies evolve they reassess their sponsorship properties. The contracts with Castrol, Continental and Johnson&Johnson were always planned to run until the end of 2014 and therefore expired on 31 December 2014 accordingly.\n“As in previous Fifa World Cup cycles, we are now in advanced negotiations with a number of companies related to sponsorship agreements in all three of our categories, ranging from Tier 1 Fifa Partners, Tier 2 Fifa World Cup Sponsors and Tier 3 Regional Supporters. Each category provides tailored marketing opportunities for companies with a range of varying rights and we expect interest to grow even more as the Confederations Cup 2017 and 2018 World Cup draw closer.”\n"

        "text": "\n\n 5.02pm GMT \n\nAs the year comes to an end over in Greece the ground is looking ever shakier for prime minister Antonis Samaras’ two-party coalition government – despite passage of two of the most controversial measures demanded by the debt-stricken country’s troika of creditors. Our correspondent in Athens Helena Smith writes:\n\n\n\n\n \n\nBarely 48 hours after parliament voted through two of the most difficult bills demanded by the EU, ECB and IMF – one allowing banks to repossess the properties of owners who default on mortgages; the other a new ‘unified’ real estate tax expected to be even more onerous for property owners – relief has been tempered by fear.\nThe two-party coalition, already under immense pressure in the court of public opinion, managed narrowly to get through the crucial votes but only at the expense of seeing its already slim majority whittled down to 153 lawmakers in the 300-seat House. This time it was the veteran conservative deputy Byron Polydoras who refused to endorse legislation that he denounced as being tantamount to “stepping on homeowners’ throats.”\nWith ongoing negotiations with the troika far from over, growing numbers of political commentators are raising the alarm bell over the fragile two-party coalition’s ability to survive – many have pointed out that with 153 MPs, the former socialist prime minister George Papandreou, the architect of Greece’s first international bailout, was forced to resign.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Athenians walk past a street performer dressed in 18th century style costume as anti-austerity slogans are seen on the wall behind, at Ermou main shopping street of Athens. Photo: AP/Thanassis Stavrakis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nAnxiety has been further deepened by a bevy of poll findings that for the past six weeks have clearly shown support for Samaras’ centre right New Democracy party on the wane and the radical left main opposition Syriza party in the lead.\nBacking for Evangelos Venizelos’ social democrat Pasok party, the coalition’s junior party, is barely at 5% – a rating that not only is sending shivers down the spines of conservatives (before the explosion of Greece's debt crisis once unthinkable) but making the government’s viability even harder.\nPublicly, government officials are “optimistic” that Greece’s assumption of the rotating EU presidency will give it a grace period and lessen the need to implement highly unpopular reforms. But they are also all too aware that with the New Year opposition against measures such as the freeze on foreclosures – extended only for primary properties valued at up to €200,000 and households with an annual net income of less than €35,000 – is bound to grow.\nAnd it is likely to begin on January 13 when mission heads representing the EU, ECB and IMF return to Athens to complete their latest review of Greece’s economic progress. Their top priorities: seeing how the government plans to plug a €2bn fiscal gap and forge ahead with ahead with even more (12,500) job losses in the bloated public sector. Watch this space!\n\n\nAnd on that note, it's time to shut up for the day. Thanks for all your comments and we'll be back tomorrow.\n\nUpdated at 5.03pm GMT\n\n\n 4.57pm GMT \nEuropean markets close on positive note\n\nThere has been some festive cheer in stock markets, with investors enthused by US growth prospects and putting aside worries about the Federal Reserve's trimming of its stimulus programme last week. Concerns about a Chinese credit crunch have also been pretty much ignored, apart from undermining commodity prices a little. So the final scores showed:\n• The FTSE 100 finished 72.03 points or 1.09% higher at 6678.61\n• Germany's Dax added 0.94% to 9488.82\n• France's Cac closed 0.51% better at 4215.29\n• Italy's FTSE MIB was up 0.71% at 18,697.15\n• Spain's Ibex ended 0.71% better at 9758.4\nOn Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 80 points or 0.5% higher.\n\n\n\n 3.50pm GMT \n\nProperty - one of the main causes of the overheated boom and subsequent bust in Ireland - is on the rise again in the Republic.\nHenry McDonald, our Ireland correspondent, writes:\n\n\n\n\n \n\nIreland's Central Statistics Office reports today that there has been another in house prices with a 5.6% hike in November.\nBut Investec economist Emmet Gaffney describes the housing market picture in Ireland as a \"two tier narrative\" with prices rising in Dublin but still flatlining in the rest of the country.\nResidential property prices increased in Dublin last month by another 1.3 % while prices elsewhere only increased by just over a half per centage point.\nGaffney notes that new builds are still at an historic low and this has prompted a new housing shortage in Dublin.\n\"In large parts of the rest of the country, the opposite is the case, with excess supply weighing on prices, along with weaker economic fundamentals,\" he added.\nIn real terms, his latter point can be seen in the starkest of terms with the empty ghost estates that still blight much of the landscape around Ireland outside of the Greater Dublin area.\nIt is worth adding that much of the new purchases for property, especially in Dublin, are cash transactions with the debt ridden Irish banks still unwilling or unable to lend in large numbers.\n\n\n\nUpdated at 3.52pm GMT\n\n\n 3.34pm GMT \n\nChristmas really is close, folks. But rather than a time of celebration and relaxation, 25th December looks like being the busiest day ever in the world of online shopping.\nThat's according to data services company Experian, anyway, which reckons UK consumers will spend 45 million hours shopping online from the start of Christmas Eve to the end of Boxing Day.\nThe prospect of bargains means many people will be clicking away rather than demolishing a second helping of sprouts (or bottle of wine)\nChristmas Day could be biggest yet for online retailers\n\nUpdated at 3.35pm GMT\n\n\n 3.05pm GMT \n\nAs it's quiet, don't miss our interview with the former German chancellor Helmut Schmidt:\nHelmut Schmidt: Britain's empire is gone, though you think it still exists\nHere's a taster:\n\n\n\n\n \n\nSchmidt is now hard of hearing and walks with the help of a frame, yet is in remarkably good health for a man of 95 who has chain-smoked all his adult life. Out of office for more than three decades, he has strong views about the state of the European Union that he helped to forge out of the tough economic conditions of the late 1970s and early 1980s.\n\"The state of Europe is problematic. European institutions are not really functioning any more. Why? Because of a lack of leadership.\"\n\n\nAnd Larry Elliott's column this morning is a real Christmas treat:\nThe state has privatised Santa and nationalised the elves\n\n\n\n 2.39pm GMT \n\nThe Santa rally has reached Wall Street, with the main indices rising in the opening moments after the opening bell is rung.\nAnd as flagged up earlier, Apple's shares have jumped 3% as investors give the thumbs-up to its China Mobile tie-up.\n\n23-Dec-2013 14:30 - DOW JONES .DJI UP 35.48 POINTS, OR 0.22 PERCENT, AT 16,256.62 AFTER MARKET OPEN \n23-Dec-2013 14:30 - NASDAQ .IXIC UP 30.67 POINTS, OR 0.75 PERCENT, AT 4,135.41 AFTER MARKET OPEN \n23-Dec-2013 14:30 - S&P 500 .SPX UP 6.96 POINTS, OR 0.38 PERCENT, AT 1,825.28 AFTER MARKET OPEN \n\nThe FTSE and the DAX are both up around 0.7% in Europe this afternoon, as traders maintain an optimistic mood despite the blustery weather outside....\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  A screen displays a chart showing the IBEX 35 at Madrid's Stock Exchange Market, Spain today. Photograph: Chema Moya/EPA\n\n\n\n\n\n 1.59pm GMT \n\nNew consumer spending data from the US has bolstered hopes that the American economy entered the crucial Christmas shopping period on a firm footing.\nConsumers spent 0.5% more in November than October, which is the biggest month-on-month gain since June, the US Commerce Department reported.\nSpending on durable goods was up 1.9% on the month - perhaps showing that shoppers were happier to buy big-ticket items once the US government shutdown was over.\nThe Commerce Department also reported that personal income rose by 0.2% in November, lagging the 0.5% rise in consumption. That suggests people tapped their savings, or took out more credit, to fund spending.\nMarketwatch has more details.\n\n\n\n 1.17pm GMT \nSummary\n\nBack to Rolls-Royce, and my colleague Rupert Neate has filed a full news story on the unfolding bribery allegations:\n\n\n\n\n \n\nThe Serious Fraud Office (SFO) has opened a formal criminal investigation into allegations that aerospace and defence group Rolls-Royce bribed the son of Indonesia's former president with $20m (£13m) and a blue Rolls-Royce car.\nThe SFO said on Monday that its director, David Green, has \"opened a criminal investigation into allegations of bribery and corruption at Rolls-Royce\".\nThe British aircraft engine maker is accused of bribing Tommy Suharto, the son of Indonesia's late president, General Suharto, over several years in the 80s and 90s in order to persuade the national airline, Garuda, to order Rolls-Royce Trent 700 engines.\nTommy Suharto denies the allegations, which were made by former Rolls employee Dick Taylor in a series of online comments.\nLawyers for Suharto, who was convicted of ordering the murder of a judge who tried him on separate corruption charges in 2000, said: \"He [Suharto] did not, and has never, received monies or a car from Rolls-Royce and nor did he recommend their engines to Garuda, as alleged.\"\n\n\nHere's Rupert's full story:\nRolls-Royce: SFO launches formal bribery and corruption investigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  The workings of a Rolls-Royce airplane engine.

With each new crisis his successors have concluded that that requires a bigger, burlier Fed.\n\n\n\n\n\n 12.48pm GMT \n\nOver in America, Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, has predicted that US interest rates could rise from their current record lows in a little over a year's time.\nSpeaking on CNBC a few minutes ago, Lacker said:\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \"I put early 2015 for when Fed funds rate will lift off but that is something that can change one way or another.\"\n\n\nLacker is currently a non-voting member of the Fed's policy committee, but will become a voting member in 2015.\nLacker also supported last week's decision by the Fed to start slowing its bond-buying programme, saying recent positive US data meant choosing to taper was \"a slam-dunk\". \n\n\n\n 12.21pm GMT \n\nMarket update: the pre-Christmas rally continues in London and Frankfurt, as the IMF's optimism over the US economy brings cheer to trading desks.\n• FTSE 100: up 37 points at 6643, +0.56%\n• German DAX: up 54 points at 9453, +0.57%\nThe French and Italian markets are flat, while Spain's slightly in the red.\nARM Holdings remain the biggest riser (+2.4%) on the FTSE 100, thanks to China Mobile's new deal with Apple (whose shares are expected to jump this afternoon).\n\n\nRANsquawk \n(@RANsquawk)\nApple $AAPL shares up 4% pre-market and make up 12% of the NASDAQ 100.

Ideally, they would vary the number of Christmases each year according to the state of the economy. This is best summarized by Paul Krugman’s depression paper ‘Wish it could be Christmas every day’, in which he also acknowledges his love of British glam rock. The Keynesians would like to see a larger role for the state, including publically-funded Santas.\nAustrians – Believe Christmas is dangerous because it inevitably ends with a nasty January hangover. Also worry about the moral hazard implications of gift-giving and the propensity for overinvestment in Christmas decorations. Reject the idea of ‘public’ holidays, arguing the free market would lead to a better outcome.\nMonetarists – Convinced they are the only ones who know how Christmas ‘really works’ and quickly become frustrated with other economists’ lack of understanding. Their thinking can be reduced to a simple identity, though this is vulnerable to shifts in the velocity of Santa’s circulation. Hardcore monetarists believe in the tight control of chocolate coins to prevent the hyper-inflation of waist lines and the hyper-activity of small children.\nChicago School – argue Christmas has no meaningful impact because gift-giving nets out. Fully rational individuals will anticipate this and adjust their behaviour accordingly.\nMacroprudentialists – busy thinking up ways to ‘smooth out’ Christmas. They would like to ‘lean against’ the festive season, perhaps by tightening credit and raising alcohol prices in mid-November and reversing these policies in early January. Some hardliners would like to introduce quantitative controls on Santa’s toy factory.\nSecular stagnationists – claim Christmas hasn’t been as much fun since the mid-1990s, but can’t really explain why.

        "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/jul/21/uk-business-corruption-poor-countries",
        "text": "\nUK professionals are acting as enablers for corrupt deals in developing countries. It happens in a number of ways and involves a range of industries, including law, banking and accountancy. For example, a corrupt state official from a developing country may seek out the services of a UK-based solicitor or accountant to process their spoils and, importantly, confer legitimacy to their actions.\nBritish professionals working in less regulated markets may encounter corruption or suspicious transactions when arranging business deals, or those in the UK could unwittingly handle the proceeds of illicit transactions. There are concerns that corrupt foreign public officials use the British housing, luxury goods and private education markets to launder stolen funds. \nFor example, after the fall of Gaddafi in 2011, questions were raised over his son’s £10m Hampstead house complete with swimming pool and cinema.\nThere are shocking case studies of corrupt deals that lose poor countries significant proportions of their annual spending budgets. The amount lost to the DRC in five suspicious mining deals, for example, was equivalent to their total health and education budget (pdf). \nThese transactions undermine the money that the UK government rightly spends on overseas development assistance. Fixing this problem and the broader issue of illicit financial flows would allow poorer countries to benefit from properly resourced public services and richer ones to spend less on aid.\nAs parliamentarians with an interest in international development, our job is to scrutinise the government’s approach to ending global poverty and this includes the global and international impact of corruption. \nLast month a network of MPs and peers campaigning on international corruption came together with representatives of relevant industries to discuss how to prevent UK professionals becoming involved in illegitimate business.\nThe speakers highlighted the variety of challenges they face. For example, as UK firms expand into emerging economies with weaker anti-bribery and corruption legislation, British professionals are often required to uphold standards that go beyond local law and expectations.\nTanya Barman, head of ethics at the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants, pointed to industry codes of conduct that require staff to go above and beyond even UK law. By upholding such standards, British professionals have the opportunity not only to prevent corruption, but to act as role models for good business practices internationally.\nTo support staff, organisations must demonstrate a proactive commitment to anti-bribery and corruption embedded at all levels. This can be created through high-quality training and consistent internal communications.\nSome businesses have also been vocal in supporting private sector transparency initiatives as a preventative measure. Greater transparency over procurement processes, promoting open contracting and requiring extractive firms to declare payments to governments all help create a climate where openness is the default.\nCompanies such as Base Titanium, BHP Billiton and Adaro have all stated their support for greater transparency, knowing it will allow them to spend less time dealing with the substantial risks associated with opaque business practices and protect their staff from the severe penalties that can occur when things go wrong.\nCreating an environment within organisations that encourages and protects whistleblowers is also key. The Solicitors Regulatory Authority highlighted its own independent whistleblowing helpline that receives hundreds of calls each year, the reports from which are then used to target their investigative resources.\n Suspicious Activity Reports (SAR) can likewise be important. These are alerts filed by company staff to alert law enforcement about the suspicious activity of a client or customer.\nYet for employees to raise concerns and for businesses to genuinely create the environments that encourage them to do so depends on the belief that escalating an issue will have real impact. Some argue that the UK’s relevant law enforcement agencies are insufficiently equipped both in terms of training and resources to take action effectively.\nSomewhat surprisingly then, for a meeting hosted by parliamentarians in parliament, our conclusions were not about passing further legislation. As a group, MPs and peers often want to fix problems with new laws, but our discussions highlight the importance of enforcing those already in place. \nWe will continue to draw attention to this issue with policymakers and while we do, urge all British businesses to play their part in preventing corruption.\nKofi Annan’s Africa Progress Panel describes it as one of the single biggest obstacles to eradicating global poverty. UK professionals should take advantage of, and pride in, the important role they have in fighting this problem worldwide.\nCatherine McKinnell MP and Anas Sarwar MP co-Chair the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Anti-Corruption.

        "text": "\nAlmost 10 years after completing her languages degree Sarah Johnson found herself in a job where she rarely spoke French or Spanish. \nIn choosing languages at university she thought she was one step closer to achieving her dream of becoming a M16 spy. “I had visions of taking down drug cartels in Mexico and combating bribery and corruption in the French-speaking parts of Africa,” she says. But the reality was quite different. \nWhile Sarah’s experience of post-graduation career confusion and disappointment is not unique to language graduates, it highlights the question of what sort of careers are available when you are able to put a second, third or even fourth language on your CV.\nThe business case for the value of language skills in the economy seems fairly clear. Last year, an all-party parliamentary group on modern languages estimated the UK alone loses £50bn a year in lost contracts due to an absence of employee language skills. In a report this week commissioned by Rosetta Stone, the 500 UK and Germany-based business executives interviewed stated that 67% of their staff required intermediate level proficiency in another language, supporting similar figures from CBI research last year. \nSo if language skills are economically valuable, what advice is there for how to use them to enhance your employment opportunities? Outside the jobs traditionally associated with languages - teaching, interpreting, diplomacy - and those less so (taking down Mexican drug cartels), what sort of jobs should bilinguals and multi-linguals be considering? And which languages give you the edge?\nBorn Global, a report last year on the language needs of the labour market, suggested that while many employers see languages as beneficial, they didn’t necessarily place them as a high priority at the recruitment stage. Does this mean job seekers should be emphasising the additional skills – such as critical and analytical thinking, international experience and intercultural understanding – that accompany learning another language? And what support is there for those already in employment who want to develop their language skills?\nJoin us on Friday at 11am to get advice from our expert panel.

        "text": "\nThirteen footballers who were arrested over allegations of spot-fixing after an undercover sting by Mazher Mahmood will face no further action. The players, including the former Premier League striker DJ Campbell and the former Portsmouth defender Sam Sodje, were detained in dawn raids by the National Crime Agency after Mahmood’s Sun on Sunday exposé in December 2013.\nIn a front-page sting headlined Ex-Prem Stars In Match Fix Probe, a number of players were accused of agreeing to earn bookings in exchange for tens of thousands of pounds. The Crown Prosecution Service confirmed on Wednesday the players are to face no further action due to there being insufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction.\nThe decision is an embarrassing blow to the National Crime Agency, which arrested the footballers hours after receiving evidence handed over by Mahmood. The investigation faltered in July last year following the collapse of the Tulisa Contostavlos trial over concerns about evidence provided by the so-called Fake Sheikh.\nThose arrested included Campbell, who plays for Maidenhead, the former Oldham Athletic midfielder Cristian Montaño and the former Tranmere Rovers defender Ian Goodison. Also held were Sodje and his brothers Akpo – a former striker with Tranmere – and Stephen.\nThe Sodjes’ lawyer, Nick Green of Kaufman Legals, said: “We have received notification the CPS are not to institute criminal proceedings. This is no more than we expected but the crown are silent in respect of the discredited Mr Mahmood.\n“Even before the judge’s ruling in the Tulisa case we had made a cross-complaint against Mr Mahmood regarding the Sodjes allegation he had acted in a criminal fashion. After this length of time both the public and the Sodjes should be notified what action is being taken [if any] against this man-cited by the recorder of Westminster as having perjured himself, resulting in the collapse of the prosecution against Tulisa.”\nThe CPS is reviewing 25 convictions over concerns about evidence provided by Mahmood in his long career as an undercover reporter for the News of the World, Sunday Times and Sun on Sunday. The CPS announced its decision not to press charges late on Wednesday, only after being approached by the Guardian.\nA CPS spokeswoman said: “A file was passed to the CPS in July 2014 from the National Crime Agency in relation to alleged football match-fixing in 2013. This case involved evidence in relation to 13 suspects.\n“The reliability of the evidence of one alleged witness in particular had to be very carefully considered in light of recent events in the trial of R v Contostavlos and Coombs. This was not the only evidence that was considered and when all the evidence submitted by investigators was carefully reviewed in accordance with the Code for Crown Prosecutors it was decided that there was insufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction.\n“We have informed the NCA of this decision and they have written to the defendants announcing that no further action will be taken.\n“Any decision by the CPS does not imply any finding concerning guilt or criminal conduct; the CPS makes decisions only according to the test set out in the Code for Crown Prosecutors and it is applied in all decisions on whether or not to prosecute.”\nA NCA spokeswoman said: “The National Crime Agency confirmed today that on the advice of the Crown Prosecution Service it has written to 13 individuals arrested in connection with a football related match/spot-fixing investigation to inform them that no further action is to be taken.\n“The men were released from bail in July 2014 following an adverse judicial comment during an unrelated trial where criminal proceedings were stayed. The NCA takes allegations of bribery and corruption extremely seriously and will pursue investigations where it is in the public interest to do so.”\n"

        "text": "\nThe former Manchester United chief executive David Gill is to stand for the Fifa vice-presidency next year after changing his mind about working with Sepp Blatter.\nGill, who sits on the FA board and the Uefa executive committee as well as remaining a director at Old Trafford, had repeatedly indicated that he would not stand for the post on the Fifa executive committee. But he has now reconsidered after lobbying from the FA chairman, Greg Dyke, and others within the game. The Uefa president, Michel Platini, is also believed to have suggested that he stand.\n“This is a decision I have been thinking about for some time,” said Gill. “Although I had initially wanted to focus on developing my relatively new role within Uefa, I believe there is an opportunity, if elected, to use the Fifa position to make a real difference while complementing that ongoing work.\n“Having sounded out many people across the game including fellow board members at Manchester United, the FA and Uefa, I would hope to make a positive contribution and use my candidacy to drive a debate for continued reform.”\nDyke has repeatedly said that the FA would concentrate its international efforts on improving relations within Uefa, having considered its bridges with Fifa burned in the wake of the ongoing fallout from the 2018 World Cup bid and his trenchant criticism of Blatter in the summer.\nBritain’s guaranteed Fifa vice‑presidency, which used to rotate between the home nations, was abolished last year by Fifa but Uefa has said it will continue to select from a list of British candidates. An election will take place at Uefa’s Congress in Vienna next March, with members voting from a list of candidates put forward by the four home nations. Northern Ireland’s Jim Boyce, who succeeded England’s Geoff Thompson in 2010, is retiring in May and has no interest in standing again.\nIn June, Gill joined Dyke in taking a stand against Blatter’s claim that British media investigations into Fifa corruption were motivated by racism. “If you look at the reputation of Fifa over the last seven or eight years, people link Fifa to bribery and corruption, to a kind of old boy’s network,” he said then. “Fifa has an executive president and that means at the end he is responsible. Besides, he doesn’t make it easy on himself. People tend not to take him seriously any more and that is not good for Fifa.”\nGill’s insistence that he would not stand had originally prompted the FA to consider other potential candidates including Rio Ferdinand and former players such as Paul Elliott and Graeme Le Saux.\n"

        "text": "\nBribery, corruption and facilitation payments were the most commonly reported issues recorded by the Institute of Business Ethics' media monitoring during 2013. They accounted for 13% of all the stories on business ethics. The sectors most frequently mentioned were extractives (70%), defence and security (63%), pharmaceuticals (47%) and broadcast/media (33%).\nBusinesses still have some way to go to embed anti-bribery and corruption mechanisms effectively into their culture. This gap between saying and doing is also reflected in external studies. A survey by Control Risks and the Economist Intelligence Unit found that 25% of companies felt there was at least a \"somewhat likely chance\" their company would be required to investigate a suspected violation of anti-bribery laws involving an employee in the next two years.\nThe cost of corruption\nThe effects of corruption on society are well documented. Politically it represents an obstacle to democracy and the rule of law; economically it depletes a country's wealth, often diverting it to corrupt officials' pockets and, at its core, it puts an imbalance in the way that business is done, enabling those who practise corruption to win.\nThe language of bribery also deceives, implying that what is being offered or expected is of no consequence. But corruption is not a victimless crime; it leads to decisions being made for the wrong reasons. Contracts are awarded because of kickbacks and not whether they are the best value for the community. Corruption costs people freedom, health and human rights and, in the worst cases, their lives. It may also cost companies, as the UK Anti-Bribery Act takes force, making an organisation culpable if it fails to have \"adequate procedures\" in place to stop bribery and corruption.\nThe challenge for companies\nMost companies offer employees some guidance on anti-bribery and corruption. However, the global nature of today's business means that organisations can have difficulties when trying to embed policies around the globe. \nMao Zedong said \"food before ethics\". While no one would suggest that bribery and corruption are good things, if you believe your job is dependent on offering or paying a bribe, the corruption policy sent round by head office may have little bearing on your decision in the moment.\nEmployers need to provide relevant support to staff to help them recognise, understand and respond to the ethical challenges they may face.\nCreating a culture that influences employees' actions, decision making and behaviour can be a challenging and lengthy process, requiring sensitivity, patience and resources. Corruption can be so ingrained into a company's culture as to be considered \"the way business is done\".\nThis can be the case especially for companies who use agents, or who operate in countries where enforcement of anti-corruption regulation is poor and facilitation payments are seen as the norm. Getting staff to see that a backhander is actually a form of corruption takes time and requires regular communication and training.\nSupport for staff\nDifficult decisions for employees often arise in everyday situations, when travelling, when offering or accepting gifts and hospitality or when negotiating with customers and suppliers. Anyone can offer or be offered a bribe. Being clear about what can and can't be accepted is good business practice and reduces the risk of corruption.\nThe Institute of Business Ethics has developed a free app, the Say No toolkit, which provides the practical guidance to recognise a difficult situation and to do the right thing in response. It has been designed to help employees have the confidence to make the right decision in situations which could lead to accusations of bribery.\nTone at the Top\nBut even with the support of a decision-making tools and apps, it is one thing to know the \"right\" decision to make, but often another to be able to apply that decision. Factors such as fear, ignorance, and real or perceived pressure to meet business targets, or pressure from a more senior figure, can make ethical decision-making harder. \nVisible support from leadership is critical; the impact of leading by example should not be underestimated. If senior management declare a zero-tolerance approach to bribery and corruption, they must demonstrate that they will support staff if they lose contracts or business in the short-term as a result. Creating a culture of integrity and openness – where ethical dilemmas arising from doing business in corruption hotspots are discussed, and employees feel supported to do the right thing – is a powerful way to help mitigate against the risk of an ethical lapse.\nThe culture of an organisation is ultimately set by people at the top. Leaders who regularly talk about ethical issues, support staff to uphold ethical standards and behave in an open and transparent way send the message to all employees, and to the wider world, that the fight against corruption is taken seriously.\nHarriet Kemp is head of engagement at the Institute of Business Ethics.

        "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/may/29/sepp-blatter-reelected-fifa-president-fifth-term",
        "text": "\nDespite the chaos and controversy engulfing Fifa, world football’s governing body, its president, Sepp Blatter, has secured a fifth term in charge.\nThe 79-year-old defeated his rival, the Jordanian Prince Ali Bin al-Hussein, to whoops and cheers from his supporters. Blatter polled 133 votes to Prince Ali’s 73, which would have been enough to take the contest to a potential second round but his 39-year-old challenger withdrew.\nIt could yet prove a pyrrhic victory. Blatter has weathered the storm in the short term but the result leaves him presiding over a split Fifa as he faces the biggest self-inflicted crisis in its 111-year history. “For the next four years I will be in command of this boat called Fifa and we will bring it back ashore, we will bring it back to the beach,” he said, again promising to make this four-year term his last. “The age is no problem. You have people that are 50 who look old.”\nPrince Ali will claim a moral victory but could only land a glancing blow on the incumbent, who appeared giddy after winning his fifth term as president. “I like you, I like my job and I like to be with you. I’m not perfect, nobody’s perfect,” he said. “Trust and confidence, together we go.”\nAs investigations continue in the United States into a web of bribery and corruption that has already led this week to seven arrests in dawn raids and charges against 14 senior executives, European football’s governing body, Uefa, will again loudly demand reform.\nIts executives meet in Berlin next weekend before the Champions League final and were in militant mood after Blatter triumphed over his younger rival, who had promised to repair Fifa’s battered reputation and serve for only one four-year term.\nUefa’s president, Michel Platini, whose 53 members mostly backed Ali, had said that it could withdraw co-operation. The Football Association’s chairman, Greg Dyke, has said that England could boycott the World Cup if other European nations decide to do so. “This is not over by any means. To quote the [US] Attorney General this is the beginning of the process not the end,” said Dyke after the vote. “The idea Blatter could reform Fifa is suspect. I’d be very surprised if Mr Blatter was still in this job in two years’ time.\n“The events of this week are so traumatic for Fifa that I cannot see Fifa reforming itself under Blatter. He’s had years to reform it and he hasn’t done it.”\nLuis Figo, who along with the Dutch FA president, Michael van Praag, withdrew from the presidential race in an attempt to coalesce support behind Prince Ali, was scathing in his criticism of Blatter after the result and called on him to quit.\n“If Mr Blatter were minimally concerned about football, he would have given up of the re-election. If he has a minimal of decency, he will resign in the next few days.”\nDavid Gill, the former Manchester United chief executive who on Friday became a Fifa vice-president, confirmed on Friday night he would carry through his threat to resign immediately because Blatter won.\nBlatter had earlier vowed to fix Fifa “starting tomorrow”, telling delegates: “We don’t need revolutions. We need evolutions. I’m being held accountable for the storm. OK, I will shoulder that responsibility.”\nDespite the spiralling crisis sparked by the US Department of Justice and Swiss prosecutors, Blatter succeeded with an appeal to the 209 member associations to give him another term. His support in Asia, Africa and pockets of Central America and Oceania helped him to victory despite opposition from Europe, the US, Australia, Canada and New Zealand. It allows him to carry on his 17-year reign as president despite having previously promised to stand down in 2015.\nBlatter has been at Fifa for 40 years, since his now disgraced predecessor João Havelange personally plucked him from watchmaker Longines to lead the commercialisation of the World Cup that has seen revenues rise in direct correlation with endless claims of bribery and kickbacks.\nIn his closing speech to delegates, his third of the day in comparison to the 15 minutes his rival was afforded, the Swiss returned to familiar themes. “What football needs right now is a strong leader, an experienced leader, a leader who knows all the ins and outs of the situation,” he said. Just as he did four years ago, when he promised a “roadmap of reform”, he called on the members to trust him, promised to “fix Fifa” starting tomorrow and made light of his age and the 17 years he has been at the top.\n“What is this notion of time? Time is infinite and we slice it up. I find the time I’ve spent at Fifa is very short and it will remain short.” To applause inside the bubble of the Fifa Congress, Blatter added: “I would quite simply just like to stay with you.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Blatter is congratulated after winning a fifth term as Fifa president. Photograph: Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\nOutside, the pressure increased. Jack Warner, the controversial Trinidadian former Concacaf president who was once one of Blatter’s closest allies and among those charged on Wednesday, delivered a thinly veiled threat after being released on bail. To hoots and applause from supporters in Trinidad, Warner said: “If I have been thieving Fifa money for 30 years, who gave me the money? How come he is not charged?”\nBrazil’s Fifa executive committee member Marco Polo del Nero fled Zurich before the meeting following the arrest of his predecessor, José Maria Marin, on Wednesday. Like the Fifa vice-president Jeffrey Webb, of the Cayman Islands, and five others, Marin is being held in custody while appealing against extradition to the US.\nBlatter’s understated opponent, Prince Ali, had warned the delegates that “everything is at stake” in the wake of the dramatic events of this week, when Swiss police swooped on the Baur au Lac hotel to arrest seven senior Fifa officials. Seven more were charged in the US and four more, including the former Concacaf general secretary Chuck Blazer, pleaded guilty. In all they were charged with 47 counts of money laundering, racketeering and tax evasion in what prosecutors called the “World Cup of fraud”. In contrast to his opponent, who tried to rally his “Fifa family” for one final time, Prince Ali warned that the world was watching and “Fifa does not exist in a bubble”.\nPlatini said: “I am proud that Uefa has defended and supported a movement for change at Fifa, change which in my opinion is crucial if this organisation is to regain its credibility. I congratulate my friend Prince Ali for his admirable campaign and I take the opportunity to thank all the national associations who supported him.”\nAs protesters outside called for Fifa to take action over Qatar’s mistreatment of migrant workers building the infrastructure for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, Blatter delivered a rambling 25-minute opening speech in which he called for unity among the member associations who would decide his fate.\n\n\n\n\nSepp Blatter: how the great survivor won another term amid Fifa crisis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“We are at a turning point. We need to pull together and move forward. We can’t constantly supervise everyone in football,” insisted Blatter. “You can’t just ask people to behave ethically just like that.”\nThe congress was briefly interrupted by Palestinian protesters backing their country’s move to have Israel banned from Fifa. They shouted “Red card for Fifa” before being bundled out by security. Later Blatter attempted to stage manage a “handshake for peace” between the delegates from Palestine and Israel after the former had withdrawn a motion to suspend the latter.\nProceedings were also interrupted by a bomb scare but Blatter’s problem’s are longer-term. The US authorities have warned that their investigation is far from over and the 14 executives charged are likely to be probed for any connection that links their actions to Blatter.\nThe seven executives arrested in Zurich, including the Fifa vice-presidents Webb and Eugenio Figueredo, remain in custody and are fighting extradition to the US.\n"

        "text": "\nGovernment plans to rip “the cloak of secrecy” from corrupt officials who hide stolen money in the UK, fail to tackle an obvious loophole in the London property market, say MPs and campaigners.\nThe concerns were raised as the government unveiled a long delayed anti-corruption plan published on Thursday.\nMatthew Hancock, the Conservative business minister, faced questions in the Commons about why the new rules aimed at improving transparency of company ownership would not apply to the property market.\nAnnouncing the plan, he said: “This is the first UK anti-corruption plan that brings together actions across government. It makes significant steps forward … but nobody would say the job is complete.”\nThe government has promised to establish a central register of company owners, open to public scrutiny and not just accountants. The new rules make it a crime to provide false information or refuse to disclose the true owner of a company.\nAt the G8 summit held in 2013 at Lough Erne, Northern Ireland, David Cameron promised to strip away “the cloak of secrecy” around shell companies, which are often located in offshore tax havens.\nMPs across the political spectrum voiced concern that the government plan would not stop corrupt foreign officials or business people from sinking ill-gotten gains into the London housing market, because there would be no requirement to disclose ownership of property. About 45% of London homes worth more than £2m are owned by overseas trusts, according to campaigners.\nThe Labour MP Kerry McCarthy questioned why the government had left this gap. “Is it not in public interest we should know who the beneficial owners are? Doesn’t he [Hancock] think the time for action is now?”\nThe Conservative MP Stephen Barclay called the property loophole one of the “notable omissions of the plan”.\nRobert Barrington, executive director of Transparency International, said the failure to include property was “a really obvious” gap. “If a house in London is owned by an offshore trust, absolutely no one has any idea who owns it.”\nHancock told MPs the government would look at expanding the register of beneficial ownership, without giving further details.\nHe also announced that the government was creating a body to tackle bribery and money laundering, by bringing together anti-corruption investigators from the National Crime Agency, the Metropolitan police and City of London police into one unit.\nThe National Crime Agency, dubbed the British FBI, was created in 2013 to tackle the UK’s most serious crimes, including fraud, money laundering, organised crime and border policing. It replaced the Serious Organised Crime Agency and other bodies, but was given a budget smaller by 20% than that of its predecessors.\nThe bribery and corruption unit, housed within the NCA, will come into operation in April, but many fear it could take much longer for the new agency to find its feet.\n“The execution and integration risks are very, very, high,” said Barrington. “One can make a case why it needs to be done, but it needs to be done very well. Otherwise there is a risk that cases might be severely interrupted or dropped”.\nBarclay, who used to have a senior anti-money laundering role at the City regulator, raised concerns that the new unit would struggle to attract qualified officers, because NCA terms and conditions were not as good as there were for the regular police.\nHe also said anti-corruption officers faced “a pernicious time limit” of just 38 days to prove complex corruption cases.\nThe MP told the Guardian this December that the government’s anti-corruption plan failed to address many flaws in the UK’s anti-money laundering regime.\nTom Keatinge, director of the Centre for Financial Crime and Security Studies, at the Royal United Services Institute, said that the private sector was also concerned about budget cuts to public anti-corruption agencies.\nHe called on government agencies to work more closely with banks and businesses to make money-laundering investigations more effective. “We are not using the private sector as effectively as we could do. Private companies are spending hundreds of millions of dollars every year [on anti-corruption measures] – way more than the government could ever dream of. There is an impressive aspirational list of things to do. But are they really doing to manage, across all these different departments to do all these 60 different things over a 12-15-month period that includes a general election?”\nObservers have broadly welcomed the announced measures but have questioned the government’s ability to implement the sprawling plan with its 66 different targets spread across multiple Whitehall fiefdoms.\n• This article was amended on 19 December 2014. An earlier version described Matthew Hancock as “the Liberal Democrat business minister”.\n"

        "text": "\nFifa has been plunged into an unprecedented crisis by the arrest of senior officials in dawn raids in Zurich following a long-running FBI investigation, while Swiss authorities simultaneously launched an inquiry into bidding for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups.\nA dramatic day for football’s world governing body began with 12 plainclothes policemen raiding the five-star Bauer au Lac hotel in Zurich and concluded with a damning press conference in Brooklyn at which the director of the FBI and the US attorney general accused senior Fifa executives of presiding over a “World Cup of fraud”. \nUefa, the European governing body, which has been backing Sepp Blatter’s rival for the Fifa presidency, Prince Ali Bin al-Hussain of Jordan, called for Friday’s presidential election to be postponed and said it might boycott Fifa’s congress. Until Wednesday’s events, ­Blatter was widely expected to be returned for a fifth term. \nSwiss police arrested seven of the 14 officials charged by the US Department of Justice, nine of whom are current or former Fifa executives. All could face up to 20 years in prison. Shortly after, the Swiss federal prosecutor swooped on Fifa’s HQ in a parallel investigation into the controversial bidding race for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, which were awarded to Russia and Qatar respectively in December 2010. \nThose charged include former senior Fifa executives entwined with decades of controversy under Blatter, including Jack Warner from Trinidad and Tobago, the former president of Concacaf, Fifa’s North American regional body, and the Paraguayan Nicolás Leoz, and those who claimed to be part of a new wave of reformers, including Warner’s replacement, Jeffrey Webb. Blatter had anointed Webb, a Fifa vice-president and head of its anti-racism taskforce, as his potential successor. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Jack Warner plays down corruption allegations\n\n\nLater on Wednesday, Warner turned himself in to authorities in Trinidad where bail was set at $2.5m (£1.6m).\nBlatter, 79, was expected to win a fifth term despite a string of scandals during his 17-year tenure but now looks less secure than at any other time during that reign. In a desperate rearguard action, his spokesman tried to argue that the dramatic events were good for Fifa and attempted to align them with a discredited reform programme promised in the wake of a swirl of allegations four years ago. \nFifa announced it had provisionally banned 11 of the charged individuals from football including Webb, Eduardo Li, Eugenio Figueredo and José Maria Marin. It also banned some no longer involved in football including Warner and Chuck Blazer, the former general secretary of Conacaf, who became a whistleblower and is now seriously ill in New York. \nBlatter described the day’s events as “unfortunate” but insisted Fifa welcomed both investigations, saying Fifa believed it would “help to reinforce measures that Fifa has already taken to root out any wrongdoing in football”. \nIn a searing indictment of Fifa’s culture of kickbacks and patronage “over two generations”, the US Department of Justice charged the 14 with 47 counts of fraud, racketeering and money laundering conspiracies. Four more pleaded guilty, including Blazer and Warner’s two sons, Daryan and Daryll. \nSeven of those charged, including Fifa vice-presidents Webb and Figueredo, were arrested in Zurich. The Swiss Department of Justice said all seven were being held in Zurich and six were resisting extradition to the US. \nUefa’s executives, gathering in Warsaw for the Europa League final, said the events of Wednesday were “a disaster for Fifa and tarnish the image of football as a whole”. Warning that Friday’s congress risked turning into a “farce”, Uefa called for it and the presidential vote to be postponed. “These events show, once again, that corruption is deeply rooted in Fifa culture,” it said.\nThe US attorney general, Loretta Lynch, said the bribes and kickbacks centred on sports marketing deals worth more than $150m but that they were not the only offences committed by executives entrusted with growing the game. \n\n\n\n\nIs this the beginning of the end for the Fifa that Blatter built?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“They were expected to uphold the rules that keep soccer honest,” she said. “Instead they corrupted the business of worldwide soccer to serve their interests and enrich themselves.” \nUS law enforcement agents uncovered evidence of bribery and corruption in the bidding process for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, the 2011 Fifa presidential election and a sponsorship agreement between the Brazilian football team and a “major US sportswear company”.\nIndictments unsealed on Wednesday against those charged went further still, detailing in hundreds of pages how Fifa’s culture of corruption and patronage had infected football confederations in North, Central and South America while executives hugely enriched themselves. \nAmong an avalanche of new claims was one that South Africa paid $10m in bribes to secure the 2010 World Cup – and that the cash was transferred via a Fifa account. The money was paid to former Fifa members Warner and Blazer. The ­latter became an FBI informer after he was threatened over millions in unpaid tax. \nA separate cash payment in $10,000 stacks was collected from a hotel room in Paris from a high-ranking South African bid committee official. Richard Weber, chief of the IRS ­criminal investigation, told the press conference in New York: “This really is the World Cup of fraud and today we are issuing Fifa a red card.” \n\n\n\n\nThe Guardian view on the Fifa arrests: football’s game-changer | Editorial\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Swiss authorities seized “electronic data and documents” in a raid on Fifa headquarters that was coordinated with the Bauer au Lac arrests. Bank documents had earlier been collected from various Swiss financial institutions. \nPolice will question 10 members of the Fifa executive committee who took part in the World Cup votes in 2010 and are expected to speak to Blatter and the Uefa president, Michel Platini, both Swiss residents. \nThe two raids were coordinated to ensure that all those to be arrested or questioned were present in Zurich before the congress on Friday and to avoid collusion between suspects. \nWebb, of the Cayman Islands, is the head of Concacaf, which reported itself to US tax authorities in 2012. The organisation had not paid taxes for years when Warner was president and Blazer was secretary general. Blazer had been cooperating for years with the FBI investigation, providing information on Concacaf’s activities over the period and wearing a wire at the London 2012 Olympics when meeting Fifa colleagues. \nThe mounting sense of crisis in Zurich has echoes of four years ago when Blatter was re-elected unopposed following the withdrawal of his Qatari rival, Hammam, amid bribery claims that again centred on Concacaf members. Then he sailed on, asking: “Crisis? What is a crisis?” The difference this time is that Swiss prosecutors have cooperated with US law enforcement to attempt to extradite Fifa officials gathered for the most high-profile meeting in its calendar. \nZurich cantonal police arrived at the Baur au Lac hotel, where senior Fifa executives habitually gather on their trips to Zurich for committee meetings, shortly before 6am. They stopped at reception to get the room numbers for the officials they intended to arrest. The men were not handcuffed as they were led away from the hotel covered in sheets. \n\n\n\n\nCharges against Fifa executives including Jack Warner date to 1990s\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast November, Fifa’s ethics ­committee closed its investigation into the bidding process that resulted in Qatar being named as host of the 2022 World Cup, ruling that any breaches of the rules were only of “very limited scope”. \nThe decision to award Qatar the tournament prompted allegations about the way it won the bid and concerns about the heat in which matches would be held and the treatment of migrant workers building the infrastructure underpinning it. But Fifa said an investigation did not find any direct link between the World Cup bid and illicit payments made by Hammam, who was banned for life for paying bribes during the campaign to unseat Blatter. \nFifa insisted its congress and the presidential election would go ahead as planned and the revelations were a positive development, even as a string of ­critics including Transparency International called on Blatter to stand down and postpone Friday’s vote. He will try to brazen out the latest crisis, focusing on the votes he needs from the 209 countries attending. \nAs delegates continued to fly in to Zurich, Greg Dyke, chairman of English football body the FA, said: “Blatter has put out a statement saying now is the time to start rebuilding the trust in Fifa. There is no way of rebuilding trust in Fifa while Sepp Blatter is still there. Sepp Blatter has to go. He either has to go through a resignation, or he has to be out-voted or we have to find a third way.”\n \n\n"

        "text": "\nWhen Tep Seila’s older brother sat his all-important grade 12 exams, he was able to use “cheat sheets” to help him pass after paying the school heads a few dollars per subject.\nBut Seila, a 21-year-old from a poor family of rice farmers with an NGO scholarship to study in the Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh, could not do the same when he sat the tests last month.\n“I think if I could have cheated I could have passed,” he said on Friday, minutes after learning that he had failed to obtain his high school diploma. “But this year was so strict and I couldn’t get the answer sheet.”\nSeila is angry that he wasn’t allowed the cheating privileges long enjoyed by Cambodian students at these exams, a pass mark from which is required for university entrance. He’s not alone.\nThe results of a government blitz on cheating and corruption at this year’s grade 12 exams have just been revealed. Only 26% of students passed, compared with 87% last year, and only 11 students out of the almost 90,000 who sat the exams obtained the top A grade.\nFor the first time in recent history, all the students who passed did so purely on merit, according to the education ministry.\nIn past years, students were able to bring mobile phones and cheat sheets into the exam rooms. Teachers would leak test papers for a fee, students would pool money to get proctors to turn a blind eye to their cheating, and parents would even throw rocks wrapped with answer sheets through the windows of testing centres.\nThis year was different. Copies of the exam were kept under lock and key, military police were deployed at testing sites, students were patted down no fewer than three times as they entered exam halls, and crucially, thousands of volunteers were hired by the government anti-corruption unit as independent monitors.\n“It was totally different compared to all the previous high school exams, particularly at grade 12,” says Preap Kol, executive director at Transparency International Cambodia.\nKol, whose organisation ranks Cambodia 160th out of 177 countries in its corruption perceptions index, says corruption is “systematic” in the education system. This means that from an early age, students learn in an environment where paying bribes is not only normal, but expected.\n“If you look at state primary schools, when students enter, they will experience being asked by the teacher to give some money, either in the form of buying lessons or as ‘thank you’ [payments],” Kol says. “Every month the teacher sends a grade book to parents and when you return to school teachers will expect some money in this.”\nMany teachers also collect small amounts of money from pupils every day, and will often only partially teach the syllabus in order to hold extra classes for more fees.\nA 2007 study by NGO Education Partnership (pdf) found that Cambodian parents were spending an average of $108 (£82) a year in informal fees to send one child to a state primary or secondary school, equal to 8.6% of average family income. But teachers, who are paid paltry salaries, say they have no choice.\nChhun Heng*, a 36-year-old philosophy teacher, has been teaching since 2003, earning $150 a month. Petrol and food alone cost him and his wife about $10 a day, he says. So like most teachers, Heng does other jobs to make ends meet.\n“How can I live on $150 a month? If you divide my salary by 30? In the morning, I spend 10,000 riel ($2.50) on coffee and noodles alone. So how about parties? Or food? Or doctor’s visits? Or toothpaste? Or haircuts?”\nHeng says he feels ashamed that he takes bribes from students, but gets defensive when the ethics of the practice are questioned. “They want to kill teachers for corruption but why don’t they target corruption in their own office first?” he says of high-ranking government officials.\nWhile Cambodian education ministers have tried to clean up national exams before, only to see them soon become mired in corruption again, the recently appointed minister, Hang Chuon Naron, appears determined to make permanent changes.\n“The result of the exam allows us to fix our education system, [because] we can see the strengths and the weaknesses [clearly],” he says. “[The reforms] are necessary because we cannot allow this to continue, otherwise we will produce massive [numbers] of graduates who will not be able to find jobs.”\nBut the three-quarters of students who failed this year have been given a second chance. The prime minister has announced a retest on 13 October. However, some students are pessimistic about their chances of passing under the same tough conditions, even with more time to prepare.\nWith tears rolling down her cheeks after realising she had failed, an 18-year-old who gave her name only as Chhorn bemoaned the changes. “I’m angry at the reforms. It was too fast and we could not focus on studying,” she said, sobbing.\n“Last year, my sister could cheat. She passed and now she’s at university. But I don’t know if I can go to university in October. I don’t know if I can pass.”\n*name has been changed\n"

The $3m budget includes $1m to $1.5m for the prize fund.\nThe global body Fide’s surprise announcement followed a visit by Vladimir Putin to a children’s tournament in Sochi, at which the Russian president praised chess as “the most intellectual sport” and agreed with the Fide president, Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, that Sochi should stage the match. Putin also stressed that Russian grandmasters had a long connection with the world title. In Soviet times both contestants were usually from the USSR and several championship matches were played in Moscow.\nPutin and Ilyumzhinov’s clever deal not only saved the historic championship first played in 1886, but was clearly also intended to damage the all-time world No1, Garry Kasparov, who doubles as a Russian opposition leader and as challenger to Ilyumzhinov at the Fide presidential election, which will be decided by the votes of delegates from 180 countries in August.\nIlyumzhinov v Kasparov has been an ugly contest highlighted by personal attacks and mutual allegations of bribery and corruption. Its outcome at present looks too close to call, but uncommitted delegates are sure to be impressed by the sudden and dramatic solution to the world title impasse. Kasparov had earlier argued that the lack of bids showed that potential sponsors were deterred by Ilyumzhinov’s eccentric reputation.\nThe Norwegian chess federation president expressed caution over the announcement, citing possible new sanctions against Russia over the Ukraine crisis. And on Friday Carlsen’s manager added a further discordant note when he denied Fide’s claim that the champion had agreed to Sochi in advance.\nMeanwhile, Carlsen made heavy weather of this week’s elite tournament at Stavanger which ended on Friday, finishing second to his Russian contemporary Sergey Karjakin and drawing seven games out of nine. Final leading scores were Karjakin 6/9, Carlsen 5.5, Alex Grischuk 5.\nThe real hero at Stavanger has been Simen Agdestein. The 47-year-old, who used to be Carlsen’s coach, looked outclassed on form but scored draws in his first seven games. It should not be such a surprise, in his youth Agdestein was a real talent who tied a match with the legendary Anatoly Karpov. At the same time he was also a football international forward who once played against an Italian team including both Franco Baresi and Paolo Maldini, two of the greatest defenders of all time.\n3362 1...Qf5? 2 Rh4! exd3 3 Rf4 traps Black’s queen.

        "text": "\nA formal investigation by the Serious Fraud Office into allegations of bribery and corruption sounds serious – and it is. So why were Rolls-Royce's shares, even after a 43% gain this year, completely untroubled? There are at least three reasons.\nFirst, these investigations tend to take ages. It was December last year that Rolls-Royce first told shareholders about \"matters of concern\" in Indonesia, China and other markets and the possibility of prosecution by the SFO. If it takes a year to get from that position to the launch of a formal investigation, a final result could be years away. The SFO launched its bribery investigation into BAE in 2004 but the case wasn't settled until 2010 when the defence contractor paid fines of £286m in the US and UK.\nSecond, the allegations about Rolls-Royce relate to 1980s and 1990s, well before the introduction of the Bribery Act in 2011. That fact does not detract from the serious of the allegations, but it might lessen any penalty if wrong-doing is proven.\nThird, any eventual reputational hit to Rolls-Royce might be lessened by the fact that the company appears to have overhauled its compliance operations already. Even under a \"bad\" outcome resulting in a large fine, the board would be able to argue that it acted early, especially on the relevant point of monitoring the behaviour of intermediaries appointed by the company.\nAll the above, of course, is subject to the actual outcome of the SFO's investigation – from the outside, it is hard to judge the precise scale of allegations. But, as matters stand, you can understand why Rolls-Royce's shareholders remain relaxed. UK politicians, on the other hand, may wish to suspend the gushing praise for Rolls-Royce while the SFO does its work.\n"

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Qatar may lose 2022 World Cup, says Fifa official\n\n\nThe Fifa executive committee member Theo Zwanziger has broken ranks to claim that, in his opinion, the 2022 World Cup finals will not be held in Qatar because of extreme temperatures in the Gulf state.\nWhile those on the Qatari organising committee have consistently stated a summer tournament is viable thanks to the development of cooling technologies to be used at grounds, sentiments their general secretary Hassan al-Thawadi reiterated on Monday, there is still widespread concern for the health of players, officials and supporters.\nZwanziger, the former president of the German football association, still sits on the Fifa executive body which, in 2010 and before his time, awarded the tournament to Qatar. He suggested the threat of legal action by anyone affected by the scorching heat may force the finals to be moved. “I personally think that in the end the 2022 World Cup will not take place in Qatar,” said the German, who is a long-standing critic of the decision to award the games to the Gulf state. “Medics say that they cannot accept responsibility with a World Cup taking place under these conditions.\n“They may be able to cool the stadiums but a World Cup does not take place only there. Fans from around the world will be coming and travelling in this heat and the first life-threatening case will trigger an investigation by a state prosecutor. That is not something Fifa Exco members want to answer for.”\nFifa has been quick to point out that Zwanziger, who had been speaking to Sport Bild, was expressing a personal opinion rather than reflecting the views of the governing body. As a result, it declined to comment on his specific observations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Fifa Executive Committee member Theo Zwanziger believes the 2022 World Cup will not be played in Qatar. Photograph: John Thys/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\nNasser al-Khater, Qatar’s executive director of communications, responded in a statement by saying: “The only question now is WHEN, not IF. Summer or winter, we will be ready.”\nZwanziger is due to step down from Fifa at its congress next May where he is likely to be replaced by his successor at the DFB, Wolfgang Niersbach. That would suggest Zwanziger will no longer have any involvement or influence at Fifa by the time it begins considering the findings of the investigation into alleged bribery and corruption in the award of the finals to Qatar, being led by Fifa’s prosecutor Michael Garcia, let alone the question of human rights’ abuses and the rights of migrant workers building the stadiums in the country.\nFifa continues to explore the possibility of moving the tournament to the European winter to avoid the soaring summer temperatures, which routinely rise above 40C. The president of the Asian Football Confederation, Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim al-Khalifa, chaired a meeting to discuss the matter earlier this month with the options of January to February 2022 and, more likely, November to December 2022 offered as alternatives to June and July.\nYet there remains opposition from domestic leagues who will inevitably be disrupted, with plenty of obstacles still to be overcome. “We applied for a summer’s World Cup, and the cooling technology that we have suggested already exists,” Thawadi said in an interview with Die Welt. “For example, we have showed at the public viewing during the 2014 World Cup in Brazil that the technique works at outdoor events. It was a great success.\n“And our system is sustainable. It is clear a World Cup in the summer is possible but, if Fifa wants to reschedule the tournament, that is also OK with us. We will just wait but I’m not afraid [of the tournament being denied Qatar]. There is no basis for us losing the World Cup. It is the first World Cup in the Middle East and will be a platform that brings people together. It will leave a positive legacy, so I am sure the finals will be held in Qatar in 2022.”\n"

        "text": "\nRebekah Brooks insisted that all reporters had to email her if they needed a cash payment for a source when she was editor of the Sun, a jury has heard.\nBrooks is said to have laid down the edict in February 2006 after a new policy was announced that deputy editors could no longer sign off cash payments.\nOn 2 February 2006, the day before, Dudman had told Brooks that cash payments had gone down on the paper as a whole, but had gone “through the roof” on the Bizarre showbusiness column.\n“Cash payments in total across the paper have gone down over the last three years,” he wrote. “In news, they dropped from 2003 to 2004 but went up last year. Biggest increase is in Bizarre’s use of cash which has gone through the roof from £2,000 to £14,000,” he wrote.\nThe email exchange was prompted by an email from Dudman on 1 February in which he conveyed the new policy to staff. “With immediate effect: no cash payments will be paid without Rebekah’s written approval,” he had written.\nDudman said he would not have had sent the email without the approval of Brooks.\nThe jury heard that the Sun’s head of news, Chris Pharo, had objected to the new system, complaining that Brooks was out of the office much of the time and would be unable to sign off payments as often as they were needed.\nAddressing the concern, Brooks told the then managing editor, Graham Dudman: “I don’t want to sign cash payments. If any reporter wants one, they email me and if they get an email back saying yes, then it is authorised. Otherwise I will be signing all day.”\nGiving evidence for the second day on Tuesday, Dudman told jurors: “The inescapable fact was if a reporter was getting cash, there was a possibility they were not giving it all to the source.\n“As I was the last man pressing the button on sending money out the door, I wanted to be sure it was being spent on journalism,” he told the jury at Kingston crown court.\nDudman, Pharo and four other current or former Sun staff are on trial for conspiracy to cause misconduct in public office in relation to alleged payments to public officials for tips and stories. All six deny all charges against them.\nDudman told how Brooks’s priority was the “quality and content of the newspaper” and the budget of the paper “definitely came second, sometimes third, sometimes fourth”.\nJurors heard that she had sent him a “rather terse” email demanding he “stop spending”, after a weekly expenditure audit found the Sun was £101,000 over budget because of outgoings on stories such as one about Madonna that cost the paper £30,000.\nDudman agreed under questioning that the email was “a hissy fit” and that she later “calmed down and started signing again”.\nIf the overspend carried on at this level the Sun, which had an editorial budget in excess of £60m, would have been over budget by £3m to £4m that year, the jury was told.\nAsked by his counsel, Oliver Blunt QC, if he agreed there was a “culture of industrial scale bribery and corruption” at the Sun, Dudman replied “absolutely not true”.\nWas he “aware that public officials were paid” at the paper? “Yes, on very rare occasions,” Dudman replied.\nWhat was the justification for that? “That the material that was obtained was absolutely in the public interest.”\nThe jury heard that one executive on the paper emailed Dudman to say that as sure as “night follows day” some reporters were putting in claims for “exclusive tips” for every story they did.\nThe full email from the executive to Dudman read: “I sometimes get asked to pay out hundreds for “exclusive” tips that have been in other papers.\n“Also there are some reporters who as night follows day always seem to bung in a confidential cash demand on the heels of nearly every story they do.”\nDudman admitted he had falsified expense claims at the Sun when he was a jobbing reporter, submitting claims for meals with a BBC contact, an Essex PR and a City of London police contact, none of which existed.\nDudman said falsifying expense claims was “completely common practice” across the industry and the management on all newspapers were complicit as it was a way of paying in lieu for overtime.\n“My colleagues did exactly the same. When I became managing editor it was abundantly clear to me this was a practice across all departments.”\nHe said when he became managing editor he did “absolutely not” take any of the submissions made by staff “seriously” as a consequence.\nHe agreed there was also a “suspicion that some journalists were treating the cash payment system rather like their expenses”, though nobody was ever accused of this.\nAs managing editor he had to satisfy himself cash was not being pocketed by reporters. In one email he sent to one of his co-defendants he said: “Just for the files for my own safety can you drop me a line to explain why do you need to pay cash for the following stories?”\nHe told jurors he was satisfied with the response from the reporter but “if there is ever an issue where the cash had gone, who got it, I would have had questions asked of me,” he said.\nSeparately during examination, Dudman was quizzed about the three stories that connected him to the charges. He said the were all “absolutely in the public interest”.\nThe three charges relate to allegations of payments to a healthcare assistant at Broadmoor, an unknown prison officer at HMP Whitemoor and allegations about a series of leaks from the Soham murder investigation.\nThe jury heard the three stories related to Rachel Nickell’s killer Robert Napper, a career criminal found hanging in Broadmoor and a story about Ian Huntley.\nDudman said he was “terrified” when he was arrested in a dawn raid three years ago, when 10 police officers in five cars turned up at his home and detained him.\nHe fought back tears when he recalled how his nine-year-old son and 14-year-old daughter came into his room when he was getting dressed in front of the police.\n“I said to them I’m going to … talk to these policemen about work. I didn’t realise at the time but my wife told me, my son’s deeply, deeply, deeply distressed and a few weeks later we notice that my daughter had a bald patch by her temple – a small one about the size of a 50 pence piece.”\nThe trial continues.\n"

        "text": "\n \nThe union representing Rolls-Royce managers has blamed the company's \"bonus culture\" for the string of bribery and corruption scandals dogging the company.\nTony Tinley, the Unite regional officer who represents 413 managers at Rolls-Royce's Derby headquarters, said he questioned whether the engine manufacturer will ever be able to tackle alleged corruption \"while the company's bonus culture places emphasis on cash rewards for managers\".\nIt was revealed last week that hundreds of Rolls managers collected bumper bonuses last year. The company's annual report showed that Rolls' chief executive John Rishton collected a £4m payout from the firm's long-term share-based bonus scheme (more than double the previous year's payout). As well as the executive team, several hundred senior managers in the scheme collected inflated bonuses.\nA spokesman for Rolls said the company has a \"relatively conservative\" bonus policy and individual payouts are made only if the overall company hits its targets. \"Then, when reviewing an individual's performance, the appraisal process looks at both what has been achieved and how it was achieved.\"\nRolls said it was \"very clear that we have a zero tolerance policy for bribery and corruption\". The spokesman said the company was \"currently carrying out a detailed programme of training\" to support its newly beefed-up anti-bribery code of conduct.\nRolls also pointed out that it this week introduced measures to strip bonuses from bosses sacked for any involvement in corruption.\nTinley, who worked for Rolls for 20 years before joining Unite, dismissed the FTSE100 company's launch of a whistleblower hotline as a gimmick that does not go far enough to address the alleged bribery scandal, which has spread to three countries.\n\"It is important that it [the whistleblower hotline] is not a gimmick and addresses the issues raised,\" he said.\n\"We also question whether the problems Rolls-Royce face will ever truly be dealt with while the company's bonus culture places the emphasis on cash rewards for managers rather than quality outcomes for the business.\n\"Unite would prefer that the grievance procedure is used to ensure that stringent standards of complaint handling are adhered to. We would also say to Rolls-Royce that there is no substitute for training managers on acceptable conduct.\"\nTinley worked for Rolls between 1979 and 1998, during the period of the most prominent bribery allegations. He was an instrument mechanic before becoming chair of the works committee, representing staff to management.\nRolls this week launched a 24 hour \"ethics line\" for its 55,000 employees to report concerns about bribery in the wake of several international law enforcement agency investigations into allegations the company paid multimillion bribes in Indonesia, China and India.\nThe Serious Fraud Office (SFO) has launched a criminal investigation into the allegations, while the US Department of Justice and India's Central Bureau of Investigations are also investigating the claims.\nRolls' chief executive, John Rishton, said the \"confidential reporting line\" was designed to \"make sure that we can hear about and address any matters of concern\".\nDick Taylor, the former employee who blew the whistle on $20m (£12.5m) of suspected bribes paid to the son of an ex-president of Indonesia, has said his concerns were ignored for six years. He added that after reporting them internally he was told he \"would be sacked, no matter what\".\nTaylor, who worked for Rolls for more than 30 years including a long stint in Indonesia, quit and began posting his allegations on newspaper websites around the world, including the Guardian's.\nIn one of the posts he said: \"Just one example is that Tommy Suharto was given $20m and new blue Rolls-Royce car … to force the Indonesian airline Garuda to take Rolls-Royce Trent 700 engines on the A330 aircraft they were buying.\"\nMeanwhile, Rolls bought out German car firm Daimler's 50% stake in Rolls-Royce Power Systems Holdings, a joint venture making high-speed engines for ships and the oil and gas industry, for an undisclosed amount.\n"

        "text": "\nWith anti-corruption campaigners reporting a continuing rise in global bribery and corruption, and governments stepping up their enforcement, corporates are facing heightened reputational and financial risks. But such risks are not just limited to an organisation's staff, with suppliers, agents and other third parties presenting similar challenges to the integrity of an international business. In response, organisations must ensure their due diligence programmes take into account the full extent of the risks that regulators and enforcement agencies may one day want to investigate further.\nThe supranational reach of the UK Bribery Act (UKBA) and US Foreign Corrupt Practiceses Act (FCPA) creates a complex backdrop. Despite the risks of failing to carry out appropriate due diligence, many organisations fall short. Recently, US authorities fined energy services company Technip more than $300m for FCPA breaches, and criticised it for having a due diligence programme which the authorities considered only a \"perfunctory exercise\" and one that was not \"adequate to detect, deter or prevent the payment of bribes by agents\".\nHowever, only half of all businesses polled in a recent survey said they review external suppliers for UKBA compliance, which could see a company commit an offence if an \"associated person\" bribes another person to obtain or retain business on its behalf. Local agents, distributors, licensees and joint venture partners may not be employees but firms are increasingly being held liable for their corrupt actions.\nThe UK ministry of justice has provided guidance on due diligence as it applies to the Bribery Act, which is set out in Principle 4. This states that organisations must apply \"due diligence procedures, taking a proportionate and risk based approach, in respect of persons who perform or will perform services for or on behalf of the organisation, in order to mitigate identified bribery risks\".\nCompanies must actively manage and mitigate risks associated with third-party relationships. The first step of any due diligence assignment should be an assessment to ascertain the particular risks. While the level of corruption in a country is a key factor, other aspects can also have an impact. These include the size or value of the business relationship, the structure of the contract or transaction, the level of government involvement and the industry sector in question.\nA due diligence investigation proportionate to the risk can then begin. For some lower-risk relationships, this can mean basic searches of sanctions and watch lists, media and political exposure databases. However, organisations seeking to do business in countries where corruption is more prevalent should always try to identify the beneficial owners of a potential partner. For example, are they government officials or connected to such individuals? An overly complex and opaque shareholding structure could in itself be a red flag.\nOther public record information and local media can sometimes prove valuable in assessing a partner's reputation, experience and integrity. This information may be available in some countries but in others it may only be retrievable by someone on the ground, through various registers and agencies if at all. Given the diversity of privacy and disclosure laws, special care must be taken to ensure that public record information is accessed legally and ethically.\nOf course, there are many instances where open-source information is limited, due to media censorship and the availability of official records, and in isolation does not provide enough insight into a potential partner. In addition, information may be incomplete, contradictory or clearly tainted by political bias or commercial rivalry. In such cases, human intelligence – comment, context and insight from local sources familiar with an industry sector and local market, the political landscape and regulatory environment – can provide valuable perspectives on the background and standing of a potential third party.\nSome more serious causes for concern relate to relationships with government officials; the reliance on political or government contacts, as opposed to knowledge; a hidden or complex ownership structure; or where the organisation may lack the experience or expertise to perform the work required. Past allegations of bribery and corruption and an unexplained breakdown of previous partnerships may also contribute to the risk landscape.\nScrutinising the activities of a third party in a distant market, with a different culture and language, presents obvious challenges. Failing to address such risks could prove damaging and a proportionate and risk-based approach to due diligence will help identify key red flags that a tick box approach would miss. Placed at the centre of a credible and values-led strategy, this will create greater resilience from scrutiny by law enforcement, customers, investors and the wider stakeholder community.\nMichael Boag is the London-based managing director of Stroz Friedberg, an investigations, intelligence and risk management company\nJoin the community of sustainability professionals and experts.

        "text": "\nThe world governing body of football, Fifa, is facing an unprecedented crisis on the eve of its congress in Zurich after Swiss authorities arrested a string of officials on corruption charges and opened criminal proceedings over the awarding of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. \nMore than a dozen plainclothed officers descended on the five-star Baur au Lac hotel on Wednesday, where officials had gathered for Fifa’s annual meeting.\n\n\n\n\nFifa corruption crisis: the key figures in the controversy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe arrests were made on behalf of US authorities, after an FBI investigation that has been under way for at least three years. The US Department of Justice said authorities had charged 14 officials, nine of whom are current or former Fifa executives. Those arrested in Zurich face extradition to the US.\n“They were expected to uphold the rules that keep soccer honest. Instead they corrupted the business of worldwide soccer to serve their interests and enrich themselves,” said the US attorney general, Loretta Lynch, at a news conference in New York. “They did this over and over, year after year, tournament after tournament.” Events tainted by corruption included the award of the 2010 World Cup to South Africa and the 2011 Fifa presidential election, she said.\nSeparately, Swiss federal prosecutors said they had opened criminal proceedings in connection with the award of the 2018 World Cup to Russia and the 2022 tournament to Qatar. These decisions have been shrouded in claims of bribery and corruption ever since the vote in December 2010.\nThe Swiss authorities seized “electronic data and documents” in a raid on Fifa headquarters. Bank documents had earlier been collected from various Swiss financial institutions. Police will question 10 members of the Fifa executive committee who took part in the World Cup votes. The 10, all still current members of Fifa’s ExCo, include senior vice-president Issa Hayatou of Cameroon and Vitaly Mutko, Russia’s sports minister who is head of the country’s 2018 World Cup organising committee. The others are Angel Maria Villar Llona (Spain), Michel D’Hooghe (Belgium), Senes Erzik (Turkey), Worawi Makudi (Thailand), Marios Lefkaritis (Cyprus), Jacques Anouma (Ivory Coast), Rafael Salguero (Guatemala) and Hany Abo Rida (Egypt).\nIn a statement, the Swiss attorney general’s office said the executives were being questioned on suspicion of “criminal mismanagement” and money laundering. It said the timing of the operation was deliberately co-ordinated with the arrests on behalf of the US authorities “to avoid any possible collusion” between suspects and because a large number of those involved in the voting for the two World Cups were present in Zurich, where Fifa president Sepp Blatter was expected to be re-elected for another four-year term on Friday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  ‘We instigated the investigation which led to arrests’ – Fifa spokesman Walter De Gregorio, at a press conference on Wednesday\n\n\nAt a later press conference at Fifa headquarters, spokesman Walter de Gregorio denied Blatter was in any way involved with either investigation and said that the Swiss proceedings were as a result of information provided by Fifa to the attorney general’s office in November 2014. He also confirmed that there was no suggestion that Russia or Qatar would lose the World Cup.\nThe arrests on behalf of the US authorities form part of an international investigation into bribes worth $100m (£65m) spanning three decades. The allegations date back to the 1990s and involve “the acceptance of bribes and kickbacks”, Swiss officials said. \nFifa vice-president Jeffrey Webb, of the Cayman Islands, was among those arrested. He is the head of Fifa’s North American regional body, known as Concacaf, which reported itself to US tax authorities in 2012. \nThe organisation had not paid taxes for several years when its president was Jack Warner and Chuck Blazer was secretary general.\nAs well as Webb, the Department of Justice statement confirmed the Fifa officials charged were Eugenio Figueredo, Jack Warner, Eduardo Li, Julio Rocha, Costas Takkas, Rafael Esquivel, José Maria Marin and Nicolás Leoz. A further four defendants were the sports marketing executives Alejandro Burzaco, Aaron Davidson, Hugo Jinkis and Mariano Jinkis. A further marketing executive, José Marguiles, was charged as an intermediary.\nThe DoJ statement confirmed the charges were for racketeering, wire fraud and money laundering conspiracies, “among other offences” and alleged a “24-year scheme to enrich themselves through the corruption of international soccer”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Hotel staff escort a man from the Baur au Lac, Zurich, shielding him with a sheet\n\n\nThe arrests came two days before Fifa president Blatter had expected to be re-elected for a fifth term. On Wednesday morning, Blatter – who was not among those arrested – was said to be actively lobbying to have Friday’s election postponed.\nBlatter has been closely entwined with many of those charged in the US during his 40 years at Fifa, including the Paraguayan Leoz and the Trinidadian Warner. Webb and Figuero are current Fifa vice-presidents.\nLast year it emerged that Blazer, who was forced to resign after being accused of financial irregularities, had been helping the FBI with its long-running inquiry. The DoJ statement said Blazer had already pleaded guilty to charges, as had José Hawilla, the owner and founder of the Traffic Group, a multinational sports marketing agency with its headquarters in Brazil. \nBlazer wore a wiretap at the London 2012 Olympics and, although seriously ill, has been continuing to help the FBI with its investigation.\n“The indictment alleges corruption that is rampant, systemic and deep-rooted both abroad and here in the United States,” said Lynch. “It spans at least two generations of soccer officials who, as alleged, have abused their positions of trust to acquire millions of dollars in bribes and kickbacks.”\n\n\n\n\nFifa corruption arrests: Uefa calls for postponement of presidential election\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe raids in Zurich are believed to have begun shortly before 6am, when six Fifa officials were led from the Baur au Lac hotel to unmarked cars with sheets over their heads.\nThe Swiss Federal Office of Justice (FOJ) said: “The US attorney’s office for the eastern district of New York is investigating these individuals on suspicion of the acceptance of bribes and kickbacks between the early 1990s and the present day.\n“The bribery suspects – representatives of sports media and sports promotion firms – are alleged to have been involved in schemes to make payments to the soccer functionaries – delegates of Fifa (Fédération Internationale de Football Association) and other functionaries of Fifa sub-organisations – totalling more than $100m.\n“In return, it is believed that they received media, marketing, and sponsorship rights in connection with soccer tournaments in Latin America. According to the US request, these crimes were agreed and prepared in the US, and payments were carried out via US banks.”\nPressure is now bound to build on Blatter to postpone Friday’s election, where he is standing against Jordanian Prince Ali Bin al-Hussein.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  L-R: (top row) Former President of the Brazilian Football Confederation Jose Maria Marin, President of the Venezuelan Football Federation Rafael Esquivel, President of Costa Rica Football Federation Eduardo Li, former President of South American Football Confederation Nicolas Leoz, (bottom row) former President of the Nicaraguan Football Federation Julio Rocha, former Acting President of South American Football Confederation Eugenio Figueredo, former FIFA Executive member Jack Warner, and President of Confederation of North, Central America and Caribbean Association Football Jeffery Webb. Photograph: Reuters\n\n\n“Today is a sad day for football,” said Prince Ali on Wednesday morning. “Clearly this is a developing story, the details of which are still emerging. It would not be appropriate to comment further at this time.”\nThe mounting sense of crisis in Zurich has echoes of four years ago when Blatter was re-elected unopposed following the withdrawal of his Qatari rival Mohamed bin Hammam amid bribery claims that again centred on Concacaf members. Then he sailed on, asking: “Crisis? What is a crisis?”\nThe difference this time is that Swiss prosecutors have cooperated with US law enforcement to extradite Fifa officials gathered for the most high profile meeting in its calendar. \nZurich cantonal police arrived at the Baur au Lac hotel, where senior Fifa executives habitually gather on their all-expenses paid jaunts to Zurich for committee meetings, at about 6am on Wednesday. They stopped at reception to get the room numbers for the officials they intended to arrest. The men were not handcuffed as they were led away from the hotel. “Very peaceful,” tweeted New York Times reporter Michael Schmidt. “Hotel staff meanwhile is freaking out.”\nPhotographs showed officers hiding the suspects behind sheets as they escorted them to unmarked cars. One, Eduardo Li of Costa Rica, was allowed to bring his luggage as he left through a side door, the New York Times reported. Reporters were shooed away shortly after arrests began.\n\n\nOwen Gibson \n(@owen_g)\nWe've been booted out of the lobby of the Bauer au Lac: \"We must protect the privacy of our guests\". Might be a bit late for that.\n\nMay 27, 2015\n\n\nThe last time international media attention was focused on the Baur au Lac was four years ago, when US and British World Cup bids were rejected in favour of Russia and Qatar.

        "text": "\nThe Serious Fraud Office has launched a criminal investigation into Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation (ENRC), the embattled FTSE 100 miner that has been beset by corruption allegations.\nThe move follows efforts by the company to conduct its own investigation into allegations made by a whistleblower relating to its Kazakhstan and African businesses, the findings of which the company had been reporting to the SFO.\nThe SFO said: \"The director of the Serious Fraud Office has accepted ENRC for criminal investigation. The focus of the investigation will be fraud, bribery and corruption relating to the activities of the company or its subsidiaries in Kazakhstan and Africa.\"\nThe company said: \"ENRC confirms that it is assisting and cooperating fully with the SFO. ENRC is committed to a full and transparent investigation of its procedures and conduct\".\nThe SFO investigates and prosecutes the UK's biggest frauds and has been instrumental in the handing down of fines and custodial sentences.\nENRC has suffered a series of high-profile departures, including the resignation this week of its chairman, Mehmet Dalman, who had been leading the internal investigation.\nOn Monday Dalman, who had staked his reputation on clearing up the ENRC mess, admitted: \"I believe I have achieved all that I can as chairman of ENRC.\"\nThe company's law firm, Dechert, which had been hired by the company to conduct its investigation, has also parted company with the mining group, a move that prompted the SFO to demand that the law firm hand over documents relating to the case.\nThe company's failed efforts to get to the bottom of corruption allegations contributed to the shares being the worst performer in the FTSE 100 last year. The controversies also come after the ousting of former chairman Sir Richard Sykes and independent director Ken Olisa in a 2011 boardroom coup backed by the founding directors, when Olisa memorably described ENRC'S behaviour as \"more Soviet than City\".\nThe so-called \"Trio\" of founders – Alexander Machkevitch, Patokh Chodiev and Alijan Ibragimov – still own 44% of the company and said last week they were considering a bid to take the company private again. The possible takeover is thought to have persuaded the SFO to launch an inquiry while the company is still listed in London.\nWhen ENRC floated in 2007, its prospectus outlined areas of potential concern for future investors, including the existence of a complex structure called the Russian Trading System (RTS). The document stated that the system involved sales made by ENRC to third parties and resulted in cash payments to ENRC's founders. Their representatives declined to comment.\nMeanwhile, a presentation given to the SFO last year by Dechert, seen by the Guardian, states that its efforts were hampered by staff forging documents, supplying the \"wrong computer to the investigations team\" and setting up a \"false office\".\nIt also outlines allegations concerning the purchase of a farm in Kazakhstan by a director of the ENRC subsidiary SSGPO, claiming that the acquisition and running costs of the farm were \"paid from SSGPO funds\" and that the farm was owned through a \"nominee shareholding on behalf of SSGPO president and major shareholder, Alijan Ibragimov\".\nRepresentatives of Ibragimov declined invitations to comment on the document, although it is not yet clear what, if any, action the SFO may take.\nMeanwhile, in Africa the company has faced questions over its former partner in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Dan Gertler. The Israeli tycoon has been dogged by accusations that a close relationship with the DRC's president, Joseph Kabila, allowed him to buy interests in the country's mining assets on the cheap – accusations he has always denied.\n"

        "text": "\nWhen I chose to study French and Spanish at university, I thought I was taking one step closer to achieving my dream of becoming a spy for MI6. I had visions of taking down drug cartels in Mexico and combating bribery and corruption in the French-speaking parts of Africa.\nIf that didn't materialise (it hasn't ... yet), I thought I would waltz into a multinational corporation and command an excellent job with a great benefits package, based purely on the fact that I had a languages degree.\nThe reality was to prove quite different.\nSix months after graduating, I found myself working as a server in the kitchen of a country hotel. I was not even allowed to take orders from customers, such was my meagre role. The only time my language skills came in useful was when the French pastry chef berated me for getting in his way.\nThe recently departed education secretary, Michael Gove, underlined how important languages are. He said: \"There is a slam-dunk case for extending foreign language teaching to children aged five.\n\"Just as some people have taken a perverse pride in not understanding mathematics, so we have taken a perverse pride in the fact that we do not speak foreign languages, and we just need to speak louder in English. It is literally the case that learning languages makes you smarter. The neural networks in the brain strengthen as a result of language learning.\"\nThat's all very well, but in the cold, harsh light of day, what did learning languages do for me and my contemporaries? Almost 10 years on, I'm working as a journalist where my knowledge of French, Spanish and Vietnamese (picked up after I left university) comes in handy only very occasionally, while other friends work in publishing, human resources, tax and law. A few went down the teaching route and one is working in immigration in Paris. In my case, I'm pretty convinced that it was my masters degree in journalism and extensive work experience that got me my job, and not the fact that I could speak three foreign languages.\nSo how useful is a languages degree?\nAccording to Rob Wall, head of employment and education at the Confederation of British Industry, only 5% of employers say it is essential that they recruit employees with one foreign language. A much larger percentage (40-45%), however, say that it is desirable to hire someone with a foreign language and that language graduates can bring an approach that is valuable in the modern workplace.\nHe says: \"Many employers really value employees with an international mindset. There's a relationship between language graduates and employees who have that sort of global perspective and first-hand experience of working in a different culture.\"\nFigures from Higher Education Statistics Agency, meanwhile, show that language graduates are not as in demand as other graduates. Only 45.8% of degree leavers in 2012/13 were in full-time employment six months after graduation compared with 92.4% of those who studied medicine and dentistry. Language graduates were third worst off for full-time work with only history and philosophy (43.5%) and law (38.2% – presumably so low because they need additional qualifications before getting a job as a lawyer) behind them.\nI remember that when I graduated, I was faced with a blanket of nothingness; the only options in front of me were the competitive graduate schemes (most of which required that I sit some kind of maths test which I was almost guaranteed to fail), a masters (I'd had enough of studying for the time being), target-hitting sales roles (not for a person who finds it hard to say no), or teaching. None of that appealed.\nI felt betrayed.\nWall adds: \"There's a real need for an honest conversation with young people when they're choosing what subjects to study ... Having a language skill is a real asset but employers want more than that. They're also looking for employability skills – teamwork, communication skills, resilience. I think our education system is quite poor at putting those to the fore ...\n\"From talking to employers, science, technology, engineering and mathematics (Stem) skills would put you at an advantage. I think languages are valued, but they are looking for broader behaviours as well.\"\nHe's right, of course. I floundered for ages, not knowing what to do.\nBut, do I regret my choice of degree? Not for a second. I get a thrill every time I get a chance to practise my languages, and being able to converse in something other than English never fails to impress. Meanwhile, the skills acquired during my four-year course, which included a year abroad spent in France and Ecuador, have undoubtedly helped me on my way to another dream: becoming a journalist.\nAs for taking down Mexican drug cartels and tackling corruption and bribery in Africa, well, there's still time. And, a few well-placed articles, written on location with the help of my language skills, might just do the job.\n"

Taylor has said he felt \"cheated\" by his experience at Rolls-Royce, the world's second largest aircraft engine maker, based in Derbyshire.\nHe said he was warned that he risked losing his job when he raised concerns over a colleague's expenses claims. Taylor subsequently took early retirement in 2004 but claims that Rolls-Royce was still making payments to intermediaries in Indonesia in 2010.\nRolls-Royce then faced further allegations that it paid bribes to an executive involved with two Chinese airlines.\nThe later allegations were made in postings by a blogger operating under the pseudonym of \"soaringdragon\" and related to deals worth a total of $2bn with Air China in 2005 and China Eastern in 2010.\nRolls-Royce said its own investigation through law firm, Debevoise & Plimpton, found \"matters of concern\" in Indonesia and China and other unspecified markets over \"concerns about bribery and corruption involving intermediaries in overseas markets\".\nThe Asia-Pacific region is a vital market for western aerospace companies targeting new customers as demand stagnates at home. According to Airbus, the region will account for 35% of aircraft deliveries over the next 20 years, with China overtaking the US as the world's largest domestic airline market from 2031 onwards.\nAs well as bringing opportunities for aircraft makers such as Airbus and Boeing, new jet sales also boost orders for engines. The frontrunners for those orders are Rolls-Royce and its US rivals, General Electric and Pratt & Whitney.\nRolls-Royce and the SFO could not be reached for comment.\n"

        "text": "\nThe GlaxoSmithKline chief executive, Sir Andrew Witty, has reiterated that his company has a \"zero tolerance\" attitude to the corrupt sales practices it is being accused of in China and other countries.\nWitty, who is battling to repair GSK's corporate reputation, was speaking as Britain's largest drugmaker announced a 14% fall in second-quarter profits to £1.3bn, missing analysts' forecasts.\nThe company's shares fell nearly 5% to £14.81, making it the biggest faller on the FTSE 100 index. Profits were hit by competition from generic products and the strong pound. The firm now expects full-year earnings per share to be similar to last year.\nIn China, where GSK has been rocked by serious bribery allegations since last summer, sales continued to fall, dropping 25% to £129m in the second quarter. Chinese authorities are investigating claims that GSK's sales reps paid doctors and health officials up to 3bn yuan (£284m) to push the company's drugs. The China scandal knocked four percentage points off GSK's otherwise stellar sales growth in emerging markets for the latest quarter. GSK staff have also been accused of bribing doctors in Poland, Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon.\nWitty said: \"I remain very concerned about allegations concerning our China business. The situation is complicated and difficult and while the investigation is active there is little I can add.\" He said the allegations were \"contrary to the values\" he believed in.\n\"In a company of our size operating in almost every country in the world there's always a small potential for some people to step outside procedure,\" Witty said. \"This isn't acceptable, and where we are aware of misconduct, we take action including dismissal from the company.\" He added that the company had changed the way it did business, including \"how we reward our sales representatives, and stopping payments to doctors to speak on our behalf or to attend medical congresses\".\nLast week GSK admitted it had dismissed staff in China in 2001 for bribing health officials. Britain's Serious Fraud Office recently began a criminal investigation into the drugmaker's sales practices around the world and said on Wednesday that it was working with the Chinese authorities for the first time ever.\nSFO head David Green told Reuters the Chinese government had a clear interest in rooting out bribery and corruption, though it might have \"slightly different perspectives\" from the SFO. The US department of justice is also investigating GSK for possible breaches of the foreign corrupt practices act.\nA British-US couple, who have been charged with illegally obtaining private information by China, will now be tried in public rather than in secret after the US and British governments raised concerns. This could mean the trial date, previously scheduled for 7 August, is moved.\nPeter Humphrey and Yu Yingzeng, who ran a Shanghai corporate investigation consultancy for foreign firms operating in China, were hired by GSK last year to investigate a break-in after a video of the company's former China boss, Mark Reilly, having sex with his girlfriend in his Shanghai home was emailed anonymously to 13 GSK executives, including Witty. The whistleblower sent a series of other emails containing detailed allegations of fraud. Reilly has been accused by Chinese authorities of running a \"massive bribery network\" and could face a long prison sentence.\nHumphrey said he felt \"cheated\" by GSK, because he had not been given the full details of the corruption allegations. GSK hired his firm ChinaWhys to investigate the \"serious breach of privacy and security\" relating to Reilly rather than the allegations themselves. GSK's internal investigations have not found any evidence of widespread fraud. Witty said he was unable to comment on Humphrey's assertion.\nDespite the problems in China, emerging markets put in a strong performance, with GSK sales up 11% , which partially offset declines in Japan and the US of 7% and 10%. European sales were flat. Turnover in the second quarter fell 4% to £5.6bn.\nGSK has introduced new inhaled medicines – Breo and Anoro – to offset the decline in its biggest seller, the asthma drug Advair, which still makes up nearly a fifth of sales but has come off patent. Uptake of Breo has been slow while Anoro, which has just come on to the US market, looks more promising, Witty said.\nHe said GSK was in a period of transition, and stressed that it had a strong pipeline of new medicines, with six drugs approved last year and more than 40 in late-stage development. The worst of the patent losses are behind it. GSK believes Tivicay, to treat HIV, could become one of its most successful launches.\n"

        "text": "\nNão vai ter Copa. There won't be a World Cup. That was the cry of protesters who a year ago brought Brazil to a standstill with legitimate concerns over the $11bn cost of the tournament that climaxes on Sunday in Rio de Janeiro. They were wrong. For all the fears about the just-in-time nature of preparations, the doomsday scenarios did not come to pass. Planes took off on time, stadiums were full, the phone networks held up, visitors were charmed. Brazil embraced the tournament while retaining a healthy scepticism for Fifa. There is still time for one last waltz on Sunday. Neutrals can only hope that it lives up to what has gone before.\nThere is a paradox here. Fifa leaves Brazil as it was before it came: a bloated beast besieged by allegations of corruption and cronyism. But at its best its main \"product\" is an assertion of football's unifying pleasures. The last four weeks have been a reminder that there is more to football than the deadening domestic whirl of Super Sundays and transfer gossip. If Germany 2006 was a joyous European melting pot, this felt like the equivalent for the Americas.\nBrazil's own 7-1 collapse against Germany must not be allowed to obscure the success of a tournament where many teams excelled, or an event that provided ample hope that Rio will be able to pull off the Olympics too. And yet the many glories seen on the pitch must not obscure the serious issues that dominated the build-up. In particular, the way that football's governing body imposes itself on hosts, landing like a branded spaceship for the duration and then making off with the proceeds, leaving little behind. That lopsided relationship must be recalibrated. If Fifa is to bestow its showpiece on countries with a huge disparity between rich and poor, it must do more to allow a broader cross section of society to be part of the event they are paying for. As in South Africa four years ago, the crowds were largely white and well-to-do. This is often true of global sporting events; it just seems more clangingly unjust in a city of extremes like São Paulo.\nIf the World Cup was conceived as Brazil's coming-out party to confirm its status as an economic powerhouse, it must now deal with the hangover in more straitened times as  elections loom in October. That will inevitably include questions about the white elephant stadiums littering the country, including those built in cities without a major football team. Even more seriously, the infrastructure improvements which are habitually promised as a Keynesian rationale for hosting major events lie unfinished. From highways in Natal to metro systems in Cuiabá, the half-built projects are witnesses to the discredited theory that spending billions on a sporting event is a sensible way to deliver much-needed public services. The collapse of an overpass in Belo Horizonte, killing two people, was a tragic reminder of the unseemly haste to deliver what was promised.\nA country where the inhabitants take both football and politics seriously will be more than capable of separating the two. Nor must the thrill of the final blot out the weeks before the World Cup dominated by allegations of bribery and corruption at Fifa. Even as the players captivated on the pitch, a $100m ticket touting scandal was being uncovered in the hotel where all the top Fifa executives were staying. The stifling corporatism of Fifa's world, the bubble in which it operates, and the culture of entitlement and pork-barrel politics that runs in its veins all point to the need for urgent reform.\nLove football, hate Fifa became a defining slogan of this World Cup and would seem to be a decent basis on which to move forward. Brazil has deep-seated problems that the World Cup didn't create and could not solve. But if hosting one of the best tournaments of modern times can remind the world of the best of the country and of the sport, while acting as a catalyst to change the worst, then that $11bn will not have been spent entirely in vain.\n"

        "text": "\nBritain's biggest arms market last year was Saudi Arabia, with the government approving £1.6bn worth of exports, including \"components for military equipment for initiating explosives\", \"equipment for the production of machine guns\", \"CS hand grenades\", \"components for water cannons\", and \"tear gas/ irritant ammunition\".\nBritish officials also approved the export to Egypt of £51m worth of arms, including assault rifles, pistols and components for military vehicles and aircraft.\nThe Foreign Office lists Saudi Arabia as a \"country of concern\" not least for breaching the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention against Torture, to which Saudi Arabia acceded in 1997.\nIn Egypt, the Guardian reported on Monday, hundreds of \"disappeared\" Egyptians are being tortured and held beyond judicial oversight in a secret military prison. \nThree journalists from al-Jazeera English were sentenced in Egypt on Monday to between seven and 10 years in jail on charges of aiding terrorists and endangering national security.\nThe arms sales figures are taken from government reports and collated by the Campaign Against the Arms Trade (CAAT), which estimates that the UK last year approved arms deals worth £2bn to oppressive regimes.\nCAAT's Andrew Smith said: \"When the UK sells weapons to oppressive governments then it is not just giving them military support, it also gives them political support and the UK's explicit endorsement\".\nThe arms sales figures coincide with the publication of a remarkable book that exposes the trickery, humbug, buck-passing, and cover-ups, by successive British governments as they turned a blind eye, and even encouraged, the payment of bribes to secure British arms contracts, notably with Saudi Arabia, and Iran under the Shah.\nDeception in High Places (Pluto Press) by Nicholas Gilby, who led a CAAT campaign to expose corruption in Britain's arms deals with Saudi Arabia, also reveals how British ministers and officials desperately tried to water down tough international anti-bribery and corruption rules being pushed by the US, notably after the scandal involving Lockheed broke in the 1970s. \nGilby describes how the UK's Ministry of Defence kept commissions secret from its own auditors. \"Ministers had devised rules designed to avoid them getting mixed up in bribery while allowing it to continue\".\nOfficials argued that it was unfair if companies were prosecuted when those demanding the bribes were scot-free. \nGilby shows how Saudi princes were the recipients of tens of millions worth of \"commissions\". As the huge, £43bn, al-Yamamah Tornado jets-for-oil contract was being negotiated, a British company, Travellers World, spent hundreds of thousands of pounds, paid for by BAE, manufacturers of the Tornado and other aircraft destined for Saudi Arabia, to prominent Saudis involved in the Al Yamamah project, and their families.\nSaudi families received more than £60m in benefits and cash from BAE between 1989 and 2002, according to Gilby.\nMuch, much, more was spent.\nThe National Audit Office report on Al Yamamah remains secret, the only report by parliament's financial watchdog still under wraps.\nThat details have emerged is thanks to Gilby's success at the UK's information tribunal and to secret documents he found, to what he describes as his great surprise, at the National Archives in Kew in 2006.\nThey revealed how the price of Tornado aircraft was inflated by £600m in the Al Yamamah deal. Their cost had been inflated by nearly a third in a deal with the then Saudi defence minister Prince Sultan.\nThe documents were hastily withdrawn by Whitehall officials who claimed their release at Kew had been \"a mistake\". the Ministry of Defence described the Saudis as being \"shocked\" when the Guardian wrote a report on the documents.\nThe Saudi government subsequently persuaded the Blair government to stop a Serious Fruad Office inquiry into payments made in the Al-Yamamah deal, threatening to stop anti-terrorist cooperation with the UK if the investigation went ahead.\n\"Defence sales offer tempting opportunities for the unprincipled the world over\".\nThe comment, by a senior British diplomat, is quoted by the author at the end of this revealing book. Britain, he says, now has one of the strongest anti-bribery laws in the world. But, he adds, the changes \"have been mainly caused by external pressures, rather than a real desire of British governments to stamp out corruption\".\nAnd how much is evaded by the use of offshore funds and tax havens still remains to be seen.\n"

        "text": "\nFifa has voted down attempts to consider age and term limits for its executives, in a move that could allow Sepp Blatter to continue as president indefinitely. The referendum required a simple majority to take the proposals forward to next year’s Fifa congress, where they would have needed the backing of 75% of members to be adopted.\nBoth were rejected out of hand, meaning the 78-year-old – preparing to stand in 2015 for another term despite earlier promising this would be his last – could theoretically carry on forever. The introduction of age or term limits was one of seven outstanding reforms listed by the former chairman of Fifa’s independent governance committee, Mark Pieth, when it was disbanded.\nThe Fifa chief ethics investigator looking into the controversial bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, meanwhile, has insisted he had access to the “vast majority” of the documents relied on by the Sunday Times for its recent Qatar 2022 allegations for “some time”.\nThe former New York attorney Michael Garcia completed his investigation into allegations of bribery and corruption surrounding the bid race on Monday and will deliver his conclusions in mid-July. “No one should assume what information we have or do not have. We have reviewed the recent reports and all the documents referenced and attached to the reports,” he told Fifa’s congress in São Paulo.\n“The vast majority has been available to us for some time, since well before the recent wave of news reports. That material was being and will continue to be examined and reviewed.”\nFifa insiders believe the claims regarding payments by the former Fifa executive committee member Mohamed bin Hammam are based on the source documents for PriceWaterhouseCoopers’ investigation into the Asian Football Confederation’s accounts. Sunday Times insiders insist the paper has information he has not considered and believes his offer to consider its cache of documents is insincere given his timescale.\nAfter Garcia delivers his conclusions to the adjudicatory chamber of the ethics committee, its chair Joachim Eckert is expected to publish the report in September or October. The most likely outcome is that Garcia, who has travelled the world to meet representatives of all the bidders and all the executive committee members still active in football and reviewed “tens of thousands” of documents, will find cause for concern with the process and the behaviour of all bidders, but no smoking gun to prove bribery.\nThe Qatar organising committee continues to insist that Bin Hammam played no “official or unofficial role” in its bid. “We have gone to what appears to us to be the original source of that data and we are confident we will have full access to everything in that data set,” Garcia said.\n“What we cannot do, and will not do, is postpone our work indefinitely on the basis someone, somewhere might publish something we have not seen yet. We will follow our process.”\nGarcia also reiterated that all football officials were required to speak to him or his team. That raises the possibility that Franz Beckenbauer – the German former Fifa executive committee member who has refused to speak to him – could face a penalty.\nBlatter used the congress to launch his campaign to run for another term by joking he would expand its mission to other planets. As he said that the organisation would become “one of today’s pioneers of hope”, in London the former FA chairman Lord Triesman joined the criticism of world football’s governing body. “Fifa, I’m afraid, behaves like a mafia family. It has a decades-long tradition of bribes, bungs and corruption. About half of its executive committee that voted on the last World Cup have had to go,” he told the House of Lords.\nDespite a series of senior figures in European football calling on Blatter to stand down and continuing corruption allegations, a confident president did not limit his ambitions to Earth. “We shall wonder if one day our game is played on another planet? Why not? Then we will have not only a World Cup, we will have interplanetary competitions. Why not?”\nThere was no mention of the more pressing controversy surrounding the Qatar 2022 World Cup that have caused concern from sponsors, the media and politicians. Instead, Blatter delivered a familiar series of platitudes, highlighting football’s popularity around the world and insisting Fifa could act as a force for good. “We must carry that flame of honesty, responsibility and always of respect. If not, we will betray the spirit of this game we love.”\nIn another familiar move, Blatter said that each of the 209 Fifa members would receive a $750,000 bonus payment and each confederation would get $7m.\nThe FA chairman Greg Dyke on Tuesday slammed the “totally unacceptable” suggestion that allegations regarding Qatar’s World Cup bid were racist, but the Congolese FA took to the podium to again denounce the claims as “racist” and “ignorant”.\nUefa delegates have called for Blatter to stand down and keep a promise he made in 2011 to make this his final term. With the Uefa president Michel Platini increasingly unlikely to take on Blatter, the search has begun for a consensus candidate who could challenge him.\n"

I have another theory, given the persecuted tenor of the rest of the Fifa president’s comments: that he has finally gone the whole hog and perceives Fifa itself to be a race. For a man who has for so long characterised himself as noble yet besieged, you have to think Fifa-ism was always the next logical step.\nAt no stage in his provocative rallying cry to the African and Asian football confederations this week did Blatter explicitly delineate what he felt was racist about journalists exposing bribery and corruption in what amounts to the awarding of billion-dollar contracts. But the overwhelming focus of his dewy-eyed speeches about defending Fifa against those who seek to destroy it suggests that Herr Blatter casts world football’s governing body itself as the true victim of prejudice.\n“Once again there is a sort of storm against Fifa relating to the Qatar World Cup,” he warned. “Sadly there’s a great deal of discrimination and racism and this hurts me.”\nThough Blatter stopped shy of floating terms such as lynching, his sense of himself as some nebulous kind of civil rights leader appears stronger by the day. “I still have fire inside me,” he intoned, repeatedly stressing that when united (behind him, obviously), Fifa is “so strong”. Stirring stuff. In fact, I can only dream that in the forthcoming movie about itself, which Fifa has bankrolled to the tune of £16m, the closing titles feature a slow-motion montage of the real-life Sepp going about his good works, set to Labi Siffre’s (Something Inside) So Strong.\nInspirationally, Sepp has a dream (and if only he was just dreaming). He has a dream of a day when his people will not be judged by the colour of their email exchanges but by the content of their Swiss bank accounts.\nWhen they can stay in five-star hotels, and take limousines down Zil lanes, and order 16-course tasting menus in Michelin restaurants, and think: God almighty, all this is free. Free at last.\nAdmittedly, there are a few glitches in my thesis – the principal one being that not three years ago, a certain Sepp Blatter was explaining how racism didn’t exist in football. If I recall correctly what we’ll flatter as his reasoning, so-called “racism” can all be solved with a handshake, because the world of football is only a game. As underscored by the allegation that Qatar’s Mohamed bin Hammam helped broker a major natural gas deal between his country and Thailand, via the latter’s Fifa representative. Small boys in the park, jumpers for goalposts, rush goalie … marvellous.\nIncidentally, it should be remembered Blatter is not alone in making inquiring journalists the scapegoat for questions that feel rather bigger. I’m sure David Cameron will have a view on the latest Fifa allegations – actually, hang on. Inevitably, the prime minister has already piped up with one. “My memories of that bidding process are not happy ones,” he explained the other day, “in terms of the way the whole thing was arranged and the role of Fifa and the rest of it”.\nBut this is odd, because my own memories of that bidding process are not happy ones either, primarily because I distinctly recall Cameron taking the time to criticise the British media for reporting Fifa corruption. The PM professed himself “frustrated” by a Panorama programme detailing chicanery in World Cup bidding, presumably imagining that such a pose would curry favour with the ordinary people who seem to remain such a beguiling mystery to him. Somehow, Cameron was unaware that anyone remotely well-versed in football (but not in its pay) knew England didn’t have a snowball’s chance in Doha of getting any World Cup under the current conventions, for the sort of reasons including – though not limited to – those currently being exposed by the Sunday Times. Back then, the PM sighed that a free press was something one had to “roll with”, so perhaps we can live without his interventions now that said free press has worked to investigate Fifa again.\nAs for the rest of Blatter’s stump speeching this week, it may yet come to mark the moment the Swiss finally stopped pretending to govern a sporting body, and appeared to openly place himself on a par with heads of state.\nCertainly, there was much to enjoy in his perorations for those of us who have long droned on about Fifa being less of a sporting body, and more of supranational quasi-state. After all, its rules trump any country’s constitution, it insists on its own legal system via those “Fifa World Cup Courts”, it sets its own tax liabilities (a tempting 0%) in the aptly classified “host” nations to which it parasitically attaches itself every four years … the list goes on.\nEven so, it felt pointedly candid of Blatter to draw attention to Fifa’s immense riches at a time when “states are in debt”. That the Fifa president should choose this particular moment to imply that his organisation’s peer group consists not of sporting entities, but of sovereign nations, feels significant.\nIt has been a long walk to freedom but on the eve of his fifth presidential term, Blatter seems to have got there at last.\n"

        "text": "\nThe Football Association chairman, Greg Dyke, has warned Sepp Blatter that an attack on the “racist” British media over Qatar 2022 corruption allegations was “totally unacceptable” and backed calls for Fifa’s president to stand down.\nIn a co-ordinated attempt to derail Blatter’s plans to stand for another four years as president of the embattled world governing body, Uefa members including Dyke took on the 78-year-old head on. “Mr Blatter, many of us are deeply troubled by your reaction to these allegations,” the FA chairman told him. “It is time for Fifa to stop attacking the messenger and instead consider, and understand, the message.”\nOn Monday Blatter toured the Asian and African confederations and, to huge acclaim, launched a broadside against those who he said were trying “destroy” Fifa, suggesting that there was a “racist and discriminatory” agenda behind the latest wave of corruption claims over the award of the 2022 World Cup to Qatar. When an embattled Blatter arrived at a tense Uefa gathering on Tuesday, he told delegates he had decided to stand for four more years because he was best placed to lead Fifa through the “storm” engulfing it.\nHe was first told by the Dutch FA president, Michael van Praag, that he should honour the promise he made four years ago to stand down after his current term, and was then warned by Dyke that his attack on the British media was outrageous.\n“The allegations you made yesterday about the British media when you described them as racist were totally unacceptable,” Dyke told Blatter. “I read the articles in the Sunday Times in great detail, the allegations being made were nothing to do with racism. They are allegations about corruption within Fifa. These allegations need to be properly investigated and properly answered.”\nDyke said the decision on whether to oppose Blatter’s bid to stand again would be taken by the FA board but added that the Swiss should “probably stick to” his original promise to stand down in 2015.\n“Mr Blatter came in this morning and said: ‘We as Fifa are under attack.’ He’s basically saying he’s under attack from the British media,” Dyke said. “Among the British public, the Fifa brand is severely damaged. I suspect that is true throughout large parts of Europe.”\nHe also called on Michael Garcia, the Fifa ethics chief who is investigating the controversial bidding processes for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, to explain why he had declined to see the Sunday Times evidence. Garcia argues he has already seen the material obtained by the newspaper.\nDavid Gill, the FA vice-chairman and former Manchester United chief executive, who sits on the Uefa executive committee, was unequivocal regarding Blatter: “The very fact that in 2011 he was clear it was four years, that should have been the situation. To change his mind is disappointing. They have worked on the structure and put in some new checks and balances. But a structure is only that; it is the people within that structure that determine whether it’s effective and delivers a Fifa that is fit for purpose.”\nGill said that to portray the new corruption allegations as a racist attack was “totally unacceptable” and the way that Blatter had dealt with them was a “stain” on world football. Van Praag, touted as a possible candidate to stand against Blatter if Michel Platini decides not to, told Blatter that his stance was nothing personal.\n“But if you look at the reputation of Fifa over the last seven or eight years, people link Fifa to bribery and corruption, to a kind of old boy’s network,” he said. “Fifa has an executive president and that means at the end he is responsible. Besides, he doesn’t make it easy on himself. People tend not to take him seriously any more and that is not good for Fifa.”\nOther Uefa members also spoke out against Blatter and urged change in order to restore Fifa’s battered reputation, with the FA general secretary, Alex Horne, calling on fellow delegates to vote in favour of term and age limits at Fifa’s Congress on Wednesday.\nBut only Dyke and Van Praag addressed Blatter directly before he left the meeting.\nThe situation has echoes of 2011, when then the FA chairman David Bernstein stood up at Fifa’s Congress and called for the election to be postponed to avoid Blatter standing unopposed.\nThe FA was then attacked by a procession of other Fifa members and failed by a large majority to get the election postponed, despite a wave of bribery claims.\nThe most recent allegations relating to the Qatar World Cup have led to a string of Fifa sponsors registering their concern at the damage to its reputation on the eve of the Brazil World Cup.\nPlatini, the Uefa president, said he was “proud” of the European reaction to Blattter. He has said he will decide by the end of August whether to stand for the Fifa position but he is widely expected not to. At that point, Uefa will start discussions about finding an alternative candidate to oppose Blatter in April 2015.\n"

        "text": "\n“They took him and poured gasoline all over him. Then they struck a match and lit him.”\nDoña A – not her real name, for security reasons – was standing up, arms crossed, lightly leaning against a ladder, and speaking in her language, Maya Mam, while a friend, a relation by marriage, translated into Spanish. There were 20 or so Mams in the room – mostly women, some children, one elderly man – and we were in an adobe-brick house in the highlands of far western Guatemala, not far from the border with Mexico, and just around the corner from an open sky and underground gold- and silver-mine called Marlin.\nThe Mams had gathered there – at some personal risk – to speak about the mine and how it impacts them. “Her husband was killed by workers of the company,” someone had said suddenly, meaning Doña A, “but she doesn’t speak much Spanish”, although it was quickly suggested she could talk in Mam and a friend would translate for her. \n“We heard the screams and the yellings but we didn’t know what was happening,” she continued. \nHer husband’s two brothers were with him: they had to run away or would be burnt alive too.\n“He didn’t want to die,” she said. “It was the rainy season. There was a little bit of water which he tried to jump into and the fire sort of went away.”\nThis was 2009: Doña A named the month and the date. Her husband didn’t survive. He was eventually taken to hospital, she said, but died there. Although a formal complaint was filed with the Attorney-General’s regional office, it wasn’t followed up because Doña A was “scared” of the consequences. \n“They said that they would lynch [“lynchar”] us,” she said. \n Why had her husband been killed? \n“He was part of the struggle,” said Doña A’s friend, answering directly. “He was defending our rights. He was informing the communities about the problems the mining company brought with it, and performing a community consultation.” \nA lawyer from Guatemala City was in the room with us. He said the consultation process had been a grass-roots initiative which managed to consult 23 communities in the region – all of which pronounced against the mine – but “death threats”, among other things, had put an end to it. \nBut how could Doña A be sure this had something to do with the mine, the company? She had answered that earlier:\n“They asked him, “Why are you against the mining?” They were wearing hoods. They asked him, “Why are you against the company?” That’s why we knew they were members of the company.”\nThis is just one of many horror stories that many Maya Mams, as well as Maya Sipacapenses, from the neighbouring district, could tell about Marlin – which they have been speaking out against, resisting and protesting for over a decade. Speak to others and it’s the same, desperate complaints: intimidation, threats, social division, violence, bribery and corruption of local authorities, destruction and contamination of water sources, livestock dying, houses shaking, cracked walls, the criminalization of protest, forest cleared, and appalling health impacts such as malnutrition and skin diseases. \nIn 2010 Guatemala was urged to suspend operations at Marlin by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) because of concerns about the impacts, as well as the failure to properly consult the Mams and Sipacapenses, but that request was ignored and the IACHR later backtracked. Indeed, in allowing the mine to go-ahead in the first place the government also ignored an international treaty, the International Labour Organization’s Convention 169, which Guatemala ratified in 1996 and which recognises, among other things: 1) indigenous peoples’ rights of “ownership and possession” “over the lands which they traditionally occupy”; and 2) indigenous peoples’ rights to be consulted about “legislative or administrative measures which may affect them directly”, and which must be carried out “with the objective of achieving agreement or consent to the proposed measures” – something many Mams and Sipacapenses say wasn’t done regarding Marlin. \nThat failure to properly consult the Mayas also means that the World Bank’s International Financial Corporation (IFC) violated its safeguards – no surprise at all – when it provided a catalytic loan of US$45 million back in 2004 to kick-start operations. The Bank’s “Operational Directive” on indigenous peoples stated that “direct consultation” must be done.\nThe company running Marlin is Montana Exploradora, a subsidiary of Goldcorp, based in Vancouver, Canada. I asked Goldcorp to comment on Doña A’s allegation that company workers had been responsible for setting fire to her husband and received this response from the Communications Director, Christine Marks:\n\nThe allegation is patently false. Goldcorp and its subsidiary Montana Exploradora do not condone violence of any kind, against anyone. We respect the right of all individuals to voice their opinions respectfully. Goldcorp and Montana Exploradora have adopted the internationally-recognized standards of “Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights.” These standards provide the guidelines for security policies which include and demonstrate respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. All of our security personnel are trained in the ‘Voluntary Principles’, as are the local members of the Guatemalan police and army.\n\nAsked about the other allegations – the intimidation, the threats, the social division. . . – Marks directed me to a Goldcorp webpage where “you’ll find common myths that have been exposed repeatedly as falsehoods.” This lists eleven such “myths”, which Goldcorp refutes, including ones that the company contaminates the local water supply, that it doesn’t consult local communities, that it doesn’t respect human rights, that communities around the mine are negatively impacted, and that it intimidates opposition. \nGoldcorp is just one of many Canadian companies currently operating in Latin America amid growing concern about their social and environmental impacts. Earlier this year the IACHR was presented with a report written by more than 30 civil society organizations about 22 large-scale mining projects in nine Latin American countries – Marlin among them – which argues that between 50% and 70% of Latin American mining is now done by Canadian firms and that Canada’s authorities, while aware of the projects mentioned in the report, continue “to provide political, legal and financial support to companies which commit or tolerate human rights abuses.”\n“Canadian mining is getting a really bad reputation,” someone in Guatemala, who I won’t name either, told me. “Canada is hell.”\n"

        "text": "\nJust over a week from the start of the World Cup in Brazil and Fifa is embroiled in its deepest crisis since its formation in 1904. When Qatar was awarded the 2022 World Cup, it was understandably controversial. Last month, Fifa president Sepp Blatter called it a \"mistake\". But fresh allegations, made this weekend, now go far beyond simple controversy.\nThere are three elements to the Qatari story, and it will surprise no one with even a passing interest in the Machiavellian world of Fifa's governance that it was only in relation to the least important of the three – the weather and scheduling (as well as a healthy dose of presidential politics) – that Blatter declared the decision a \"mistake\".\nThere are two far more serious concerns. First, the swirling rumours of bribery and corruption are hardening into serious evidence of genuine wrongdoing. If the revelations that emerged in the Sunday Times over the weekend are properly verified, then the Qatar World Cup must be halted immediately. Labour's sports spokesman, Clive Efford, has rightly said the process must be rerun if these allegations are proved.\nFifa's rules are clear – the World Cup hosting must not be bought. Just like the trophy itself, it has to be won fairly and openly. Any payments or gifts that could give even the impression of exerting influence are strictly prohibited.\nThen there is the very real matter of life and death. At the start of April, I travelled to Doha as part of an investigation into the conditions of migrant workers labouring on the construction sites of Qatar. What I saw was a disgrace. The workers I met told me of abuse, exploitation and deception.\nOne Kenyan father I met had been unable to see his child for five years because his employer had seized his passport and left the country, leaving him stranded and unable to work or go home. Others told of no payment or underpayment and said the conditions they lived in were inhuman. Sometimes as many as eight men shared a room no bigger than a child's bedroom.\nMany of those I met told me about a total lack of health and safety protection. The number of deaths by heart failure is so extreme that the firm appointed to assess the allegations which were unearthed by the Guardian, Amnesty International and others, recommended a full inquiry.\nThe Qataris have since announced very limited reform, including some changes to kafala, the sponsorship system for migrant labourers. But let's be clear, this is a very small step in the right direction; there is industrial-scale abuse of workers in Qatar and nothing announced so far will bring that to an end. These proud workers shouldn't have to die while building a World Cup.\nFootball prides itself on being the most democratic sport in the world. There are almost no limits to playing the game. I have seen the universal power of football to inspire people – whether it's the South Africans I know who used football to stand up against apartheid, or the children I joined in a kick-about with in a Palestinian refugee camp in Jordan, or the trainee Afghan soldiers I watched playing a game in the Helmand dust.\nEach of them love a simple and once-beautiful sport. However, it's not the power to inspire the millions but the alleged corruption of the few that now taints the game we love. Ever since the sport broke out of its ghettos in Britain's public schools more than a century ago it has had a unique appeal.\nThis morning those who govern the world's one genuine global sport are accused not just of corruption in a single bidding process – but of corrupting a noble and egalitarian sporting ideal. The entire sport of football is now on trial.\n"

        "text": "\nThe Serious Fraud Office (SFO) has arrested two people and raided five homes as part of its investigation into alleged bribery and corruption at the engineering group Rolls-Royce.\nThe unidentified men were arrested and questioned over allegations that the British aircraft engine maker bribed Tommy Suharto, the son of Indonesia's former president General Suharto, with $20m (£13m) and a blue Rolls-Royce car. The men are not current or former Rolls-Royce employees, it is understood, but \"fixers\" who set up deals on the company's behalf.\nThe arrests came as the SFO and officers from the National Crime Agency and the City of London police raided an office building in central London (not a Rolls-Royce building, it is understood), and five homes. \"In connection with a Serious Fraud Office investigation, we can confirm a number of search warrants have been executed at various properties in London today. Two men were also arrested,\" the agency said.\nThe SFO, which has seen several of its most high profile cases collapse recently, began a formal investigation into the allegations in December after a Rolls-Royce-commissioned independent investigation turned up \"matters of concern\". The allegations, which mostly date back to the 1980s and 1990s, were raised by former Rolls-Royce employee Dick Taylor.\nTaylor, who worked for Rolls-Royce for more than 30 years, including a stint in Indonesia, turned whistleblower after the company ignored concerns he raised internally.\nAfter taking early retirement, Taylor said he decided to \"tell the truth\", and since 2006 has been posting comments below Rolls-Royce articles on newspaper websites around the world, including the Guardian. Taylor claims the Derby-based company paid bribes in order to persuade the national airline, Garuda, to order Rolls-Royce Trent 700 engines.\nLawyers for Suharto, who was convicted of ordering the murder of a judge who tried him on separate corruption charges in 2000, said: \"He did not, and has never, received monies or a car from Rolls-Royce and nor did he recommend their engines to Garuda, as alleged.\"\nRolls-Royce, which is due to publish its full-year financial results today, declined to comment.\nJohn Rishton, Rolls-Royce's chief executive, has stressed that the company will not tolerate illegal conduct. He said: \"I want to make it crystal clear that neither I nor the board will tolerate improper business conduct of any sort and will take all necessary action to ensure compliance.\"\nLast year Mark King, head of Rolls-Royce's aerospace division, resigned just four months after being promoted to president of aerospace, the division beset by the allegations.\nThe company has not explained the departure of King, a 27-year company veteran. It declined to state whether his departure was linked to the investigation, stating only that he was leaving for \"personal reasons\".\nThe arrests could prove embarrassing for the prime minister and royal family, who have spoken of their pride in one of Britain's best-known companies.\nDavid Cameron has praised Rolls-Royce as an enterprise \"of which the whole country can be proud\", and the Duke of Cambridge has described it as \"one of the United Kingdom's great global companies\".\n"

The emails claim the alleged malpractice breaches the UK's Bribery Act and the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which ban bribery of foreign officials.\nA GSK spokesman said: \"We have zero tolerance for unethical or illegal behaviour.

        "text": "\nIt is May 2010 at Monaco's vast Le Sporting banquet hall, where 800 guests have responded to an invitation from one of central Asia's most powerful, and secretive, oligarchs.\nThe host has packed the venue's gardens with white roses and arranged for entertainment from the singer Jennifer Lopez and French DJ David Guetta.\nSeveral guests execute an impromptu lezginka, a traditional dance from the Caucasus, and a crowd forms to shower them with $100 and €100 bills, a sign of the donors' respect, which is then paid to the musicians.\nThe grand celebrations have been arranged to mark the wedding of one Sabir Chodiev, the son of Patokh Chodiev, 60, an Uzbek businessman whose then £1.85bn fortune had largely been secured with two Kyrgyz business partners in resource-rich Kazakhstan.\nThe timing of the wedding just about coincided with the zenith of the worldwide boom in commodity prices and the whole event is estimated to have cost Chodiev around £6m, a fifth of which went on Lopez's one-hour turn.\nThose were better times in the world of Patokh Chodiev – plus his two business partners, Alexander Machkevitch, 59, and Alijan Ibragimov, 60 – a trio who largely became known in the City because of their links to a painful hit to many UK savers' pension pots.\nAfter floating their mining company, Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation (ENRC), on the London Stock Exchange in 2007, the company's shares were quickly propelled into the FTSE 100 and, therefore, into many British pension funds.\nBut the past two years have seen persistent allegations of corruption against the company, along with a string of corporate governance rows, and the shares have crashed, prompting the trio to take the company private again. When the stock market closed on Friday evening the shares, which have fallen by 85% from their peak, were traded publicly for the last time.\nSo is London bidding farewell to the trio, whose company was dubbed \"more Soviet than City\" by Ken Olisa, a former non-executive director who was ousted by the three founders? Probably not.\nENRC may be disappearing from the London Stock Exchange, but the professional and personal lives of the tycoons link them inextricably to the UK.\nOne of their main businesses, private firm International Mineral Resources (IMR), is run out of London, several of their legal scraps are still being fought here, while ENRC continues to be investigated by the Serious Fraud Office for \"fraud, bribery and corruption\".\nLavish properties in the most exclusive parts of the capital continue to be owned by the businessmen, while among the diverse collection of London names touched by the oligarchs are Miriam Gonzalez, the lawyer and wife of deputy prime minister Nick Clegg; the steel billionaire Lakshmi Mittal; and the British artist Damien Hirst.\nThe tycoons' partnership was conceived in Kyrgyzstan, one of central Asia's poorest countries to the south of Kazakhstan, where Machkevitch and Ibragimov grew up.\nThe pair are thought to have met at a wedding in 1971 but pursued separate careers, as Chodiev worked in Japan for the Soviet ministry of foreign trade.\nBut by the late 1980s, in a move that has never been explained, they came together during the early stages of perestroika. Machkevitch and Ibragimov are believed to have moved to Moscow in 1987 to trade everything from scrap metal to iron ore, aluminium and oil.\nChodiev joined them two years later, with much of the trio's business being conducted in Kazakhstan, a market they knew well.\nFrom there, they gained control of newly privatised chromium, alumina, and gas operations in Kazakhstan, creating partnerships (and eventually feuds) with some of the pioneers of early post-Soviet capitalism, including the London-based Reuben brothers and the metals trader Lev Chernoy.\nQuite how this transformation was achieved remains unclear. Observers of the period say anybody could succeed in Kazakh business if they enjoyed powerful sponsorship, which explains the tales of alleged sweetheart deals with Kazakhstan's president, Nursultan Nazarbayev, and of charging \"special commissions\" to the Mayfair-based Mittal for acting as intermediaries to the Kazakh elite.\nA spokesman for the trio would not comment on the payments, while Mittal's spokeswoman has denied the payment was a commission.\nWhat is known for certain, however, is that from the chaos of the 1990s, the trio grew a substantial business, part of which became ENRC.\nBut by the time that company floated in 2007, some of their wealth had already arrived in Mayfair. In 2005 a British Virgin Islands-based company associated with Machkevitch paid £14.5m for a palatial three-storey Georgian mansion in one of London's most opulent squares.\nFive years earlier, Chodiev bought his £10m penthouse in a glass-fronted development near London's Vauxhall Bridge, that boasts a 24 hour concierge service, residents' gym and secure underground car park.\nTwo Mayfair properties are registered to a company run by Chodiev's daughter Mounissa Chodieva, head of ENRC's investor relations.\nA two-mile stroll north to Portman Square brings you to the offices of Amre Youness, who runs the trio's private mining business IMR.\nYouness has married into the Heinz family, and so is related by marriage to US secretary of state John Kerry.\nBut despite his high-level links, IMR's private status has meant the company has been far less visible than ENRC.\nEven so, the firm has attracted controversy. It sold ENRC a business that the listed company's former lawyers say may have made \"cash payments to African presidents\", while IMR is accused in the Dutch courts of \"blatant fraud, exacerbated by bribery\" by Russian fertiliser group EuroChem. IMR denies the accusations. ENRC and the trio deny all allegations of bribery and corruption.\nMeanwhile, the oligarchs are furious at how they believe they have been treated by the City, arguing they have spent millions on lawyers and bankers in order to meet London compliance standards, only for their shares to slump. One close associate says: \"They've been mugged by the City.\"\nThat anger is being played out against Dechert, the law firm that raised the allegations about payments in Africa, which ENRC is suing for allegedly overcharging for an internal corruption investigation.\nThe lawsuit names Clegg's wife, Gonzalez, who worked on the project. Dechert did not comment.\nThat case follows ENRC's pursuit of its former director, the City grandee Sir Paul Judge, who it accuses of leaking company information to the media. Judge denies this and is suing for libel.\nMeanwhile, potentially embarrassing details about the tycoons and their families are set to be aired elsewhere in London's high court, as ENRC's former head of corporate finance, Kirill Stein, is suing the trio for £17m in bonuses and interest he says they reneged on paying.\nStein also names as defendants three of the oligarchs' children – Chodieva, Alla Machkevitch and Dostan Ibragimov – all of whom have London connections.\nAlla, along with her sister Anna, is a director of the London-based Machkevitch Foundation.\nAnna is said to be one of the largest collectors of Damien Hirst: she has acquired pieces including butterfly wing mosaics, cabinets of manufactured diamonds and the signature Hirst \"dots\".\nAll of which means that – for now – London and the trio remain bound.\n"

        "text": "\nFifa's chief ethics investigator will not consider millions of documents underpinning a new wave of corruption allegations surrounding the award of the 2022 World Cup to Qatar.\nMichael Garcia promised to complete his work by next week, but his decision not to examine the documents obtained by the Sunday Times could undermine faith in his investigation at a crucial time.\nIt is understood that Garcia has not asked for the documents, said by the newspaper to number hundreds of millions of files including emails and accounts linked to the Qatari former Fifa vice-president Mohamed bin Hammam.\nThose familiar with the cache say it would be impractical for him to examine them before his new deadline, days before the 2014 tournament begins in Brazil on 12 June. Qatar has faced calls to be stripped of the 2022 World Cup in the wake of fresh allegations that Bin Hammam used a $5m (£3m) slush fund to not only buy goodwill for his tilt at the Fifa presidency but to aid the 2022 bid.\n\"After months of interviewing witnesses and gathering materials, we intend to complete that phase of our investigation by 9 June 2014, and to submit a report to the adjudicatory chamber approximately six weeks thereafter,\" said Garcia.\n\"The report will consider all evidence potentially related to the bidding process, including evidence collected from prior investigations.\"\nGarcia has spent more than a year and £6m travelling the world to interview those involved in the race to host the 2018 and 2022 tournaments and investigate allegations of bribery and corruption.\nHe has interviewed representatives from all nine of the bidding nations, including a summit with a Qatari delegation on Monday. His findings will inform the Fifa president Sepp Blatter's decision on whether to order a revote.\nBut the fact that Garcia will not properly analyse the evidence from the Sunday Times database, which will form the basis of further allegations about the Qatar bid in the weeks to come, will raise concerns that he has already formed a view.\nJim Murphy, the shadow secretary for international development, said: \"If the Garcia investigation refuses to accept the Sunday Times evidence the process will be a sham and Fifa will be forever tainted. Corruption must be tackled.\"\nMeanwhile, David Cameron, who was one of the so-called \"three lions\" involved in the final push in December 2010 for England's doomed £21m bid to host the 2018 World Cup, said Garcia's inquiry should be allowed to take its course.\n\"We will see what happens with this inquiry into the World Cup. And who knows what the chances may be for the future,\" the prime minister said.\n\"There is an inquiry under way, quite rightly, into what happened in terms of the World Cup bid for 2022. We should let that inquiry take place rather than prejudge it.\n\"My memories of that bidding process are not happy memories in terms of the way the whole thing was arranged and the role of Fifa.\"\nCameron said he, David Beckham and the Duke of Cambridge were assured by numerous Fifa members of their support.\nBut in the end England secured only one vote among the 22 executive committee members apart from that of their own Fifa vice-president, Geoff Thompson.\nHe added: \"I'll always remember Beckham saying to me afterwards: 'I can cope with being lied to but I can't cope with people lying to the prime minister and the future king'.\"\nTwo of the failed bidders for the 2022 World Cup, Australia and Japan, have joined calls for the bidding race to be rerun. Both exited in the early rounds of the voting process, with Qatar defeating the US 14-8 in the final runoff.\nYuichiro Nakajima, the head of Japan's unsuccessful bid to host the 2022 World Cup, said the allegations should be investigated by Garcia and backed calls for the bid process to be rerun. \"All of this points to the need for a major reform of how Fifa is governed,\" he said.\nThe chief executive of the Football Federation Australia, David Gallop, said the new revelations were a serious development and told local media his federation had been involved in interviews and the production of documents.\n\"It's too early to say whether that reopens the door of anything that happened a few years ago in terms of Australia's position but it's a bit of a 'watch this space' at this stage,\" he said.\n\"We've been heavily involved in this now for many months in terms of the investigation that Mr Garcia is carrying out. We've got people who've been involved for some time now.\"\nThe Qatar 2022 bid committee has denied any wrongdoing and said it had nothing to hide. \"We say again that Mohamed bin Hammam played no official or unofficial role in Qatar's 2022 bid committee.\"\nMark Pieth, the chairman of Fifa's recently disbanded independent governance committee, said the vote should be rerun. He told CNN: \"What I think is that it's going to shake Fifa to the foundations, because it's the first time that an institution like Fifa has to ask itself whether it should totally rerun the decision of a host, the hosting decision, and the consequences could be massive, could be about billions of dollars.\"\nMeanwhile, Michel Platini, the president of the European football federation, Uefa, is discussing the possibility of leading a sit-down protest when Blatter announces his intention to stand again as Fifa's president in Brazil next week.\nPlatini, who is increasingly considered unlikely to challenge Blatter for the top job, may ask the heads of the 54 European FAs to remain seated when the majority of the other 155 Fifa members rise to acclaim the announcement as a means of registering disapproval at Blatter's decision to stand for a fifth term despite earlier promising to stand down.\n"

        "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/18/chevron-court-case-ecuadorians-toxic-waste",
        "text": "\n\"Their lives smell of oil.\" These are the words that Ecuadorian lawyer Juan Pablo Saenz used to describe the living conditions of his clients: 30,000 residents of the Oriente in the Ecuadorian Amazon who say that oil giant Texaco – since bought out by Chevron – dumped 18bn gallons of toxic waste in their region. Friends of the Earth reported: \"Death, miscarriages and birth defects cut a swathe through communities, threatening some indigenous groups with extinction. The destruction of the rainforest environment, noted for its biodiversity, was similarly devastating.\" I met Saenz when he was in London last week talking about Texaco's activities in Ecuador. Since 1993, lawyers have been representing Ecuadorians in a bid to obtain compensation from Chevron for the damage to their homes and health. In 2011, an Ecuadorian court ruled in their favour and demanded Chevron pay $19bn in restitution. Ecuador's supreme court later reduced the damages to $9.5bn but upheld the original ruling.\nThe Chevron case is something of a parable in two ways: first, it is a lesson about the incandescent response of multinational corporations to any questioning of them; second, it's a reminder how little the voices of campesinos (peasant farmers) and indigenous people in Latin America seem to count in the eyes of the companies that want to make use of their land.\nNew Yorker magazine last year noted Chevron's initial response to the lawsuit: \"We will fight until hell freezes over and then fight it out on the ice.\" Such intransigence has characterised Chevron's entire approach: few concessions and little genuine dialogue with the Ecuadorians living near the toxic sites. In 1995, Chevron agreed to clean up the contaminated sites in return for the Ecuadorian government dropping proceedings against the company. But, according to campaign group ChevronToxico, \"Chevron simply threw dirt on top of unlined oil pits that the company used to store permanently left-over oil and chemically laced production water that later leeched into the underground water supply\". Chevron's obstinacy has yielded some results in the past week, after a New York court ruled in its favour. The company had filed a countersuit against the Ecuadorian plaintiffs and their lawyers for allegedly using bribery and corruption to secure the original verdict in the Ecuadorian courts. Chevron says it is vindicated by the outcome, but it should be noted that Judge Alberto Guerra, its star witness, has admitted that \"Chevron paid him $48,000 'for physical evidence' of bribery as well as travel expenses for his and his son's families to flee Ecuador … attorneys fees ... and committed to pay him $12,000 per month for living expenses in the US for two years\". In 2008, Sam Singer – a US crisis management guru – sent a memo to Chevron spokesperson Ken Robertson advising him on how to deal with the Ecuador case. SF Gate reported that Singer had advised Chevron to portray Ecuador's court system as corrupt and to mount \"counter attacks\" on the plaintiffs and their legal team.\nRegardless of whether the New York verdict was a just one, few deny Chevron's overarching tactics have been controversial. According to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, as part of its offensive it has subpoenaed more than 100 email accounts, including those of environmental activists and journalists; it recently filed court documents against a political cartoonist as it was concerned by \"real, immediate, and direct\" injuries resulting from the Ecuadorian judgment. One could be forgiven for assuming America's third-largest corporation could withstand some light satire, but Chevron seems determined to view itself as the victim.\nDuring his meetings in London, Saenz was keen to refocus attention on his clients: \"This is about the people suffering, the destruction of the Ecuadorian Amazon. That's the central battle here; everything in New York is a distraction.\" It's true that international coverage of the case has centred on legal showboating as opposed to the real and daily suffering of the people. And it is fair to say Chevron's attitude has been far from contrite – in fact, it has been almost indignant – since it was first presented with the lawsuit 21 years ago. It is interesting that the company's counterclaim utilised the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (Rico) Act, normally reserved for prosecuting members of the mafia. It seems to say something about Chevron's \"do you know who we are\" mindset: the big company is simply going about its legitimate business; the peasants wanting some form of reparation are nothing more than extortionists. One can't help but feel there's an element of \"know your place\" about the whole ordeal.\nPerhaps the fact that this lawsuit is still going after more than 20 years is evidence that it's not only Chevron that can be stubborn. From the Niger Delta to the Gulf of Mexico, oil companies have relied upon the fact that people are too politically disenfranchised to hold them accountable for collateral damage. But perhaps in this case, Chevron is being somewhat hubristic. The last comment Saenz made about his clients? \"They're still strong and they won't go anywhere.\"\n"

        "text": "\nGreg Dyke is the largest small man I have ever met. In terms of height he is conspicuously short, but everything else about him is enormous: he has a massive head, a barrel chest, great white shark teeth, the posture of a prize bull and a voice so loud that the couple in a far corner of the empty bar have to abandon their own conversation and end up joining in with ours. The FA chairman has the joyful air of a man who considers global news headlines his natural habitat, and finds himself at the centre of a story big enough to accommodate his personality.\n\n\n\n\nSepp Blatter’s Fifa exit ‘brilliant for football’, says FA’s Greg Dyke\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe last time Dyke was this famous, he was resigning from the BBC amid the uproar of the Hutton report in 2004. This time round the resignation is Sepp Blatter’s, and Dyke the triumphant hunter, not the prey. “People keep coming up to me and saying, ‘Well done, you got rid of him!’” he hoots, roaring with laughter. “To which I say, ‘I think the FBI had more to do with it than me.’” But the impression of a gladiatorial clash between two titans is unmistakable – as is the surprising degree of similarity between football’s mortal enemies.\nAlthough still stunned by the Fifa president’s resignation, Dyke thinks he can explain it, starting with the allegations of a bribe to erstwhile Fifa official Jack Warner. “I think it was a combination of three things. The $10m payment I think must have been authorised by him. Nobody else could authorise $10m. Not $10m. Also, I don’t know this for certain, but I wouldn’t be at all surprised if Jérôme Valcke [Fifa’s secretary general, who faces strong evidence that he knew of the alleged bribe] did say to Blatter, ‘I’m not taking the rap for this, you agreed.’ That’s one. Two, I think the FBI are getting close. And I suspect the big sponsors said, ‘You can’t do this, it’s got to change.’”\nI ask if he expects Blatter to be arrested and he falls uncharacteristically silent, so I put the question a different way. If he had to put £50 on it, which way would he bet? “Yeah.”\nEither way, says Dyke, Blatter hasn’t a hope of remaining in post until his successor is appointed this winter. “No!” he snorts scornfully, perhaps thinking of the speed of his own departure from the BBC. “He’ll be gone. He won’t last. He can’t last more than a couple of months. The one thing you discover if you run an organisation is that the moment you say you’re going, you’ve gone. He’s dead. It’s over. If you resign, you resign.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  ‘He was very personable, very likable. In his way’ … Greg Dyke with Sepp Blatter in 2014. Photograph: Alexander Hassenstein/Fifa/Getty\n\n\nThe two men first met shortly after Dyke was appointed to the FA in 2013. “He was very personable, very likable. In his way. He’s got charisma, there’s no doubt. But I never trusted him, no. He reminded me of Nixon, what I call Nixonian politics, ie, ‘You’re either on our side or you’re the enemy, and anyone who criticises is the enemy. Everything I do is by definition right.’ Blatter’s argument at the end, when he said this is a politically motivated conspiracy – I mean, what world does he live in? These are a bunch of crooks. Or it appears,” he corrects himself, “they are a bunch of crooks.”\nWhen the pair attended a meeting in February, Dyke had been teetotal since New Year’s Day. “And then I got sat next to Blatter at this bloody thing, and I thought, ‘I can’t do this, I can’t sit here without a drink.’ So it put me back on the bottle!”\nRelations had by then more or less broken down, perhaps predictably. “Blatter hates the English. He hates the FA. And he hates the British media. Blames them for everything.” An FA chairman who made his name and fortune at London Weekend Television, “my spiritual home”, before becoming director general of the BBC, would have been bad enough. What must have made matters worse is the absence of any discernible indication that Dyke has forsaken his former profession. “Once you’ve been a journalist, to some extent you’re always a journalist,” he agrees. “Last week on Wednesday, which bits of my brain jumped up? It was the journalistic bits.”\nThe animosity was mutual. Dyke has “always assumed Fifa is corrupt. It’s always been corrupt.” Blatter cast himself as a global football missionary, and won praise even from his critics for exporting the game into developing countries. But when I ask if Blatter’s chief interest in Africa and Asia was weak governance susceptible to bribery and corruption, without hesitation Dyke says, “Yes. That’s my view. Someone very senior in Fifa – I won’t name who – said to me: ‘Football will always be corrupt. Basically because it’s run by men. If you walk into a room and there’s a million pounds on the table and a naked woman in the corner, most men will take the million pounds and fuck the woman.’ Now, I happen to believe that’s not what life is like, and I think it’s a very depressing view of the world. But that was someone quite senior in Fifa, and his account of what life is like. It’s quite sad, isn’t it? It’s a pretty sordid world, Fifa.”\nDyke’s disgust doesn’t feel confected, and he offers another anecdote with glum dismay. Blatter, he was told, boasted to a pretty female journalist: “‘What’s interesting about my job is, whichever country I go to, I’m more important than the president.’ Now, if that’s true, then it tells you a lot about him. Massive ego. I think he believed he was not answerable to anybody.”\nDyke’s analysis of his nemesis’ unaccountability sounds broadly reliable. The more he talks, however, the more it sounds like an uncannily accurate description of Dyke as well. With the obvious exception of starkly different attitudes to corruption, the two men’s leadership style does not appear to be dissimilar.\nWhen I ask if his public attacks on Blatter and Fifa might have been rashly intemperate, his tone is nonchalantly defiant. “See, I work on the basis that we have nothing to lose, the English FA. We don’t need Fifa’s money. We don’t want to bid for another event, not while Blatter’s there. We can say what we like. Also, I’m 68. This is the end of my career.” Will the FA be his last big public job? “Yeah. Yeah. You know, I’m 68. I was 68 last week. The only advantage of being old – well, of being old and having made money – is you don’t give a fuck.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Sepp Blatter will not last four-year term, says Greg Dyke – video\n\n\nHis colleagues might regard a chairman who doesn’t give a fuck as a dangerous liability. “Well, as an employee, if you have that attitude you are in some ways quite interesting, and in some ways quite dangerous. You’ve got to work out what’s in the interests of the organisation at the time. I think the FA needs to be on the front foot more than it is. It’s been on the front foot this week. I mean, the really interesting thing is, whenever I go to a football match and I’ve had a go at Blatter, people come up and shake your hand.”\nIn the large parts of the world where the FA is perceived as an arrogant, neocolonial elite, Dyke’s comments might enjoy less approval, and do little to dispel that reputation. “No, I think it’s good for the FA’s reputation. We stood up. We stood up. The FA hasn’t always stood up. The history is not that good. We stood up to be counted. We stood up to him.”\nIf Blatter was oblivious to Fifa’s international reputation, Dyke appears similarly unaware of any animosity towards the FA. “Well, I think it’s true that it’s perceived like that politically in some quarters, but not by the football-watching public. ’Cos they all love the Premier League. No, I think this is a bit of a myth. That somehow it’s colonialism. It’s not colonialism at all. But there is no doubt that there are a set of values which you find in western Europe, and in America, and in Australia, that don’t apply everywhere.” Such as? “Well, my experience in Africa is that when people go into politics in Africa, it’s incumbent upon you as part of that to look after your family. That’s just cultural, it’s a cultural difference.”\nHe does concede that Boris Johnson’s offer to host the 2018 World Cup in London was unhelpful. (Culture secretary John Whittingdale later said something similar about 2022.) “Yes. Because it looks like we’re doing it all for our personal gain. I think we’ve been too far involved in all of this, publically. We should not bid for it, no.” The mayor did not consult Dyke before publicising the proposal. “He just woke up one morning and thought” – he adopts a silly voice – “‘This is a good idea, isn’t it?’ We won’t have the World Cup in 2018, and we certainly won’t have it in 2022.”\nBut he has no intention of heeding Qatar’s public warning this week to stop querying its right to host in 2022. “I thought it was funny,” he laughs. “I’m an adult and I’ve been around too long. I once had Blair after me, I’ve been there before. Of course, you can’t convict people on journalism, so we will have to wait for the Swiss investigation to do its job. But if you read the Sunday Times and the recent book, it’s all in there. If you read all of that, it’s hard to believe that it wasn’t corrupt.” His phone rings, and when he hangs up he is beaming. “We’ve just discovered that the FBI investigation does include scrutiny of the two World Cup awards. That’s good. I wouldn’t want to be Qatar. They’ll sleep even less well tonight.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Greg Dyke: Qatar should lose 2022 World Cup if Fifa corruption proved – video\n\n\nHe does sometimes worry that he speaks his mind too freely – “Yeah, course I do,” – but bursts into giggles, which suggest he doesn’t worry much. “Oh, I expect I’ve done it this week,” he goes on happily. “Already I’m sure there’s people in the FA saying, ‘Ooh, he shouldn’t have said that, he shouldn’t have said this.’ I’m certain there’s already people saying I shouldn’t have said anything about Qatar.” How does he feel about that? “Oh, I take no notice. ’Cos I’m too old to care really.”\nHe attributes his cavalier bombast partly to age – he is 68, he tells me five times – and partly to his wealth, which me also mentions numerous times. But he admits, “Actually, I’ve always been quite outspoken, I suppose. Ever since I first knew my wife, she has always said, ‘Oh, tell them to fuck off. Do what you want to do, say what you want to say.’ It doesn’t sound, I say, as if he needed much encouragement. “No, we were probably a bad combination!” he hoots.\nAnecdotes to illustrate the point keep tumbling out, delivered with exuberant glee. His car registration plate is M16 WMD (“It’s a sort of up yours!”), and when I use the word “bollocks” a few minutes later, his face lights up and he is off again: “That was one of my great quotes!” At last week’s Fifa congress he told a journalist that Blatter’s speech was bollocks. “I get back to the hotel, it was already on Twitter! Luckily it didn’t seem to get much further,” he adds, but his eagerness to repeat the line to another journalist casts some doubt on his relief.\n\n\n\n\nGreg Dyke must put plug in Qatar talk if Fifa revamp is to unite the world | Barney Ronay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLike Blatter, Dyke can lapse into mystifyingly abstract aphorisms. “In the end it’s all about ideas,” he offers sagely, apropos of nothing.

        "text": "\nThe troubled FIA presidency of Jean Todt came under a fresh spotlight on Friday when David Ward – an adviser to former president Max Mosley – launched his campaign to replace him.\nWard, 57, has resigned as director general of the FIA Foundation and his manifesto, entitled \"Agenda for Change\", highlights some of the many perceived shortcomings of Todt's four-year reign.\n\"The FIA can give the impression of being antiquated and autocratic,\" says Ward. \"The threshold for nominations for presidential candidates has been set high, which favours the incumbent and deters other candidates.\n\"Recently, there has also been unfortunate use of 'support letters' at various FIA regional meetings which are designed to elicit public commitments of support before the election process even opens, thereby deterring alternative candidates from coming forward. These are of questionable legitimacy. The powers of the presidency are too wide to be effective or fully accountable\".\nThe election is due to take place in early December and Todt, the former Ferrari team principal, has yet to confirm that he will stand.\nTodt, who took over the presidency in 2009, has been privately criticised by a number of teams for a perceived lack of leadership at a time when the sport needs it badly. He also decided to go ahead with the controversial Bahrain Grand Prix.\nWard, a former amateur racing driver who was once political adviser to the late Labour leader John Smith, said he wants to \"adopt a policy against bribery and corruption to the latest international standards and amend the ethics code accordingly\".\nHe added: \"All I would ask is for a fair hearing for the governance reforms I believe are necessary to strengthen the effectiveness, transparency and accountability of the FIA, so that it can better serve the interests of its membership.\"\nWard wants the FIA to regain its credibility as a respected regulatory body. And to that end he wants to see the publication of its accounts. He would also like a chief executive to be appointed to work alongside a new management board.\nThese are difficult days for F1. Bernie Ecclestone, the sport's chief executive and commercial rights holder, faces the possibility of jail after bribery allegations made in Germany.\nAnd there is no Concorde Agreement in place – the three-cornered agreement between Ecclestone, teams and the FIA. Todt needs to deliver a Concorde Agreement to boost his campaign. But even that may not be enough.\n"

It said offenders included companies that should have known better and firms that had already been told to clean up their act.\nIn its report, the FCA said: \"Given our strong regulatory focus and previous publications on anti-money laundering and anti-bribery and corruption we expected firms to have taken more action.\n\"Our findings were of particular concern where the firms were part of major financial groups, which should have been aware of our expectations. In some cases, the firms we visited were from groups that had been subject to previous regulatory attention but we still found significant weakness.\"\nAt one firm, the annual money laundering report for 2011 did not go to the board until August 2012 and another had not checked its money laundering risks since May 2011.\nAnother firm's bosses said its exposure to financial crime was \"low\" but could not show how they had reached that conclusion.\nThe FCA has pledged to clamp down amid concerns that London is a major venue for laundering the proceeds of crime and money used to fund terrorism.\nThe regulator found widespread failings in checking high-risk customers such as government officials from dictatorships. A firm had checked a long-standing customer from the Cayman Islands a week before the FCA's visit but there had been no check for more than 10 years before that.\nA customer withdrawal of £25m triggered an alert at a firm but there was no evidence of how it was investigated or cleared.\nThe regulator said firms were not doing enough to clamp down on bribes. Limits on gifts and hospitality that did not need management approval ranged from £25 to £500.\nThe FCA said it was disturbed by the failings because its rules were clear and it had already exposed slack practice at banks and insurers.\nIts 2011 review found that three quarters of banks did not run enough checks on customers' wealth. The following year Coutts was fined £8.75m for sloppy controls.\nAn FCA spokeswoman declined to comment on whether wealth and asset managers found wanting in its latest review would be punished.\nThe report said: \"We have provided feedback to those firms in our review but we expect all firms to consider our findings.

        "text": "\nDoctors, patients and pharmaceutical companies have often existed in silos, but with public sector spending on healthcare continually on the rise and longer-term conditions such as cancer and alzheimer's disease affecting more and more people, the system could very well use a boost of collaborative innovation.\nInstead of a reactive system that deals with the fallout of illness, different stakeholders are keen to promote the reverse, a dynamic system with more patient-doctor-treatment feedback loops. This system might be possible with the help of pharmaceutical companies, who are well placed to offer their business acumen to healthcare services, as well as connecting their products to patient wellbeing. \nFor instance, Pfizer's thinkspace programme has in the past offered support in the form of development workshops to patient organisations, which range from how to raise funds to engaging volunteers. \nAnother example is Janssen's text4baby service which provides mothers with useful health information on baby care, timed to the stage of their pregnancy or age of child.

Stumbling blocks are often attitudinal, with medical professionals and patients alike wary of the lack of transparency and allegations of bribery and corruption sometimes connected to the industry.

        "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2014/nov/05/aid-watchdog-right-accuse-dfid-corruption",
        "text": "\nIn a report published last week, Britain’s aid watchdog, the Independent Commission for Aid Impact (Icai), accused the Department for International Development (DfID) of failing to address the petty but widespread corruption that blights the daily lives of the world’s poorest people. The report has proved controversial, with some holding it up as proof that UK aid money is funding corruption overseas and others claiming it shows DfID is “setting back the cause of poverty reduction”. But it also raises fundamental questions about the nature of corruption, our ability to tackle it, and its place on a fiercely competitive development agenda, say three experts.\nDo we target the servant or the paymaster?\nBritish aid money is funding corruption overseas. Billions in British aid “goes to corrupt nations”.\nThese simplistic headlines have greeted a less than flattering assessment of how DfID approaches corruption in the countries it supports. Here are the headlines I would have written after reading the same report and the response to it:\n\nSimplistic headlines fail the poor.\nWatchdog fails to understand the nature of corruption.\n\nFrankly, the report from Icai is a mess. It is a wasted opportunity to rethink how we deliver aid with integrity.\nUndoubtedly, the aid community’s approach to corruption does need to change – but let’s consider how little the Icai report helps us. It doesn’t actually investigate any standalone anti-corruption projects, and yet it somehow concludes that we need more of these. It provides little credible evidence to back its recommendations. It lambasts DfID for instances of corruption that no external aid agency could possibly control.\nBritish civil servants and DfID’s country-based officers have no power to sanction another country’s police officers when they demand payment for investigating crime, or to intervene when women are deliberately excluded from running for political office. The only sanction DfID has at its disposal is to withdraw all aid – and how does that help the victim of crime or the woman prevented from representing her community?\nSo if, for instance, public servants are open to bribery because their wages aren’t being paid, do we target the servant or the paymaster? Well, oddly enough, the authors of the Icai report concede that DfID initiatives are already targeting the higher levels of corruption, and doing it rather well.\nIn Nigeria, for example, the report talks of Justice for All’s success in winning the trust of many in the judiciary and of the DfID-supported State Accountability and Voice Initiative that works with members of Nigeria’s state houses of assembly on transparency and accountability. These are great examples of DfID “thinking and working politically” to support its partners’ domestically driven national initiatives for reform, and Icai says unequivocally that they “provide a firm basis for fostering anti-corruption champions and to start beating back corruption”.\nCorruption is fuelled by any source of cash and resources. So all outside actors – including big business and donor governments – have to take a bird’s eye view of corruption and collectively support a coherent strategy.\nThe research shows that what works best is any support we can give to locally led reform of institutions and political processes and to changing elite attitudes. What we also know is that kneejerk window-dressing projects, like setting up anti-corruption agencies, rarely work when imposed from outside – though they make good headlines. But we’re likely to get more window dressing rather than less as a result of the Icai report.\n• Heather Marquette is director of the Developmental Leadership Program and reader in development politics in the international development department, University of Birmingham\nRegardless of whether you call it corruption, it works\nIn most cases, what we refer to as corruption is the reality of how many political and economic systems work. Patronage-based politics and economics is a resilient form of governance that has persisted for centuries. It refers to a blurring of the lines between private and public, whereby people gain access to economic opportunities or state resources through personal connections with those in positions of relative power. This is not a “third world” characteristic; recent research from Italy, for example, shows that politically connected firms are rewarded with better terms and rates in local credit markets.\nWhat’s more, the term corruption refers to a huge range of issues, which makes the term analytically problematic (to the point of being useless). Yes, much of the time having to pay informal taxes makes it difficult for poor people to make a decent living. But that is just one part of the story.\nIn many cases, people pay unofficial charges because it makes life easier. Informality is, like corruption itself, considered a roadblock to development or bump in the road towards good governance. But informality creates flexibility and room for manoeuvre in otherwise suffocating bureaucratic systems. Consider the mother in Sierra Leone who needs medicine for her sick daughter: paying a small fee to the staff at her local health clinic might speed up the procurement of drugs, whereas going through the formal and often inefficient channels could put the girl’s life at risk.\nPreliminary data from a recent SLRC survey of 1,000 households in Nepal – one of the two countries from which Icai drew primary evidence for its report – show that almost 80% of taxes paid to non-state actors (local groups, religious organisations, trade associations and so on) are reported as being negotiable with the collecting agent. A far lower proportion of state taxes are considered negotiable, but the fact is that it still happens.\nMost would consider negotiability of this kind a form of corruption – how can something like tax be flexible? But regardless of whether you call it corruption, it works. There is often a moral economy of taxation, which means that rates can be made to reflect an individual’s circumstances. If a household suffers a major shock (asset loss, job loss), the informality of the system means payments can be negotiated down. Therefore, “corrupt” systems often offer a more viable means of getting by for ordinary people.\nDfID will now be under a lot of additional pressure to crack down on corruption. But the approach shouldn’t be to go after the individuals asking for money. It should be on the wider systems that create this. Arguing for a more nuanced understanding of corruption does not mean it’s OK to sweep these problems under the carpet. What it does mean is making sure the right things get targeted.\n• Richard Mallett is a researcher with the Secure Livelihoods Research Consortium\nPerhaps DfID is better placed to deal with corruption on a global scale\nThe report threatens to push British aid policy in the wrong direction. It has received a lot of media coverage, and, like most public discussions in Europe on bribery and corruption in developing countries, the debate has been at times sanctimonious, alarmist, opinionated – and mostly devoid of evidence.\nWhile Icai cannot be held entirely responsible for this media reaction, it did oversimplify the story and the background evidence; and exceeded its own terms of reference by making a strong policy case rather than carefully assessing alternatives. And, perhaps somewhat disingenuously, its report only gives a cursory nod to extensive efforts by DfID – and the UK government more generally – to stamp out corruption at the global level. It looks like an effort to push policy down one particular, narrow, anti-corruption track without a proper appraisal of the evidence.\nGiven limited resources to tackle endemic and deeply complex issues in the world’s poorest countries – ranging from malaria and Ebola, to bonded child labour, infant malnutrition and sexual abuse of vulnerable women, among many others – should DfID’s anti-corruption portfolio be expanded to “specifically target the everyday corruption experienced by the poor and educate the population about the ill effects of corruption”, as recommended by Icai?\nThere are two good reasons why DfID should not be panicked into making a policy decision based on this recommendation.\nFirst, there is simply no evidence that DfID has the capacity or the comparative advantage to run such programmes effectively. In ignoring this issue, Icai comes close to contradicting itself. Indeed, it cites research by the U4 Anti-Corruption Resource Centre, funded by DfID, showing “there is little strong or conclusive evidence that the [anti-corruption] interventions that have been pursued have been effective”. If we don’t yet know how to do the job effectively, why pour money into it?\nSecond, if DfID were to allocate more resources to anti-corruption, why not consider the option that it is better placed to deal with corruption on a global scale – the activities that Icai labels “indirect”? Since Britain is such an important global centre of financial, banking and legal expertise, it is a good place from which to try to stem global corruption.\nIf the president’s son can no longer park his billions uncounted, unrecorded and untaxed in London, Luxembourg, Zurich or the British Virgin Islands, then he may not charge the chief of police such a high monthly rate for his post, and the police might be under less pressure to squeeze everything they can from each poor person who crosses their path.\nThe agreed goals of this review were considerably more nuanced, and judiciously written to inform anti-corruption policymaking. Yet, Icai overstepped the mark in the way it has summarised its conclusions, and cannot be said to be behaving entirely responsibly toward the British public and parliament.\nAdditionally, managing large anti-corruption programmes in low-income countries is now a rather big business. If my taxes are to be spent on this, I would like to be sure the decision was taken on the basis of what works best for those in low-income countries where DfID is working with, rather than a resource-intensive business opportunity.\n• Mick Moore is a professorial fellow at the Institute of Development Studies, and chief executive of the International Centre for Tax and Development \n"

        "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/apple-act-on-labour-right",
        "text": "\nFor electronics companies, the decision to outsource manufacturing operations to the developing world isn't just about cost-cutting. The speed and flexibility of the vast Asian workforce, assembled to build slick, shiny gadgets for western consumers, allows for unprecedented turnaround times on new products. And by outsourcing production to China, the world's electronics giants – Dell, Sony, Microsoft, Apple, Samsung and others – are closer to the hundreds of component manufacturers, engineers and material eco-systems that their products depend upon.\nIt's a business model that's highly profitable – particularly for Apple, which recently announced a $13.4bn profit for the first quarter of 2014.\nBut there's a human cost to outsourcing to countries with lax or non-existent labour laws. Suppliers often hire and fire thousands of people at a moment's notice to meet production quotas, press them to work excessive overtime that leaves workers exhausted and clinically depressed, and skirt around health, safety and environmental concerns. All of which leaves an ugly stain on the corporate social responsibility credentials of the companies that use their services.\nIn the clothing sector, these issues have been part of public and corporate consciousness since the mid-1990s, when brands such as Nike were condemned for their use of sweatshops in the developing world. Then in 2010 the electronics industry suffered its own sweatshop scandal when 18 workers at Foxconn facilities in China, where most of the world's gadgets are produced, attempted suicide. Fourteen died.\nAlmost four years on, have electronics suppliers in the developing world cleaned up their act? Peter McAllister, director of the Ethical Trading Initiative, says: \"We are seeing some positive signs in China, such as increases in the minimum wage as a result of worker protests and chronic labour shortages. But the labour rights challenges should not be underestimated. [We see] high levels of bribery and corruption, audit fraud and a poor health and safety culture. Freedom of association is also severely restricted. These issues are rife in many sectors and pose real challenges for companies committed to trading ethically.\"\nAnother concern is the widespread use of student labour: young people aged 16-18 are often drafted into factory positions under the guise of work experience placements, so that suppliers can meet production schedules. Apple's latest Supplier Responsibility Progress Report details many of the steps it has taken to fix some of these problems, including worker education programmes and tighter monitoring of working hours.\nBut many of these issues are systemic, and will require a concerted cross-industry effort through the likes of the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC), as well as work with NGOs and government, to properly address. \"Respect and protection for fundamental human rights is absolutely important,\" says Julie Schindall, director of communications at the EICC, \"but in practice, when for example you do not have a state that either enforces its own laws or does not recognise what would generally be seen as the most basic and fundamental human rights laws, it puts a company in quite a difficult position.\"\nSome electronics companies exacerbate the situation with their own demands. Chasing the lowest price from suppliers can directly affect labour conditions: if a supplier has to slash its own overheads to make a profit on manufacturing items for big-name electronics companies, then worker pay, equipment, working hours and living conditions are likely to be sacrificed first.\nUnderestimating supplier capacity, and their ability to deal with rapid ramp-ups in production, can have a similar knock-on effect on working conditions. \"A supplier is never going to say no,\" says Sean Ansett, chief sustainability officer at Fairphone, a social enterprise which aims to manufacture an ethically produced smartphone and alter existing supply chains. \"So unless you truly understand their capacity, frankly, you're turning a blind eye to some of these issues.\" In worst-case scenarios, part of the production process ends up \"going out the backdoor to a place you've never visited, where there's no oversight whatsoever, and potentially some very egregious violations [of human rights]\".\nApple's sustainability progress report also details a dramatic increase in the number of audits it carried out last year (up from 298 in 2012 to 451 in 2013), and other companies seem to be following suit. But Ansett contends: \"It's just a snapshot of what's going on a particular day or series of days at the factory, rather than the whole movie.\"\nWestern commentators often confine their focus to issues around audit fraud, but there are bigger problems at play. \"It's important to understand some of the deeper issues driving this. Chinese factories are often too scared to share labour rights challenges with British, European or US buyers, fearing that they'll lose important business,\" says McAllister.\nTo address this, Ansett advocates greater transparency and \"models which are mutually beneficial\". Part of this trust lies in recognising that problems may occur, but agreeing that these will be addressed with help from both parties, and that the client company will continue to place business with the supplier in the aftermath.\nAs trust develops, suppliers will realise that western companies can be important allies in improving conditions for workers, according to McAllister. For example, peaks in production can be managed effectively through collaborative working. \"Good planning of orders not only leads to increases in productivity, it directly benefits workers through improved management of working hours and overtime,\" he says. Schindall says several EICC members are now working with their suppliers to predict and manage surges in capacity and bring about such changes. Financial incentives for suppliers to meet ethical and environmental targets can also lead to improved standards. And it's also important that workers understand their rights, so both companies and their suppliers should \"open up dialogues and communications internally in factories, and allow [workers] to hold [trade union] elections that are democratic and fair, so that they too have a voice\", Ansett concludes.\nJoin the community of sustainability professionals and experts.

        "text": "\nRolls-Royce has been plunged into fresh crisis after India became the latest country to launch a formal investigation into allegations of bribery and corruption at the British defence and engineering firm.\nThe FTSE 100 company, which is already the subject of a Serious Fraud Office (SFO) criminal investigation into claims it paid multimillion-pound bribes in Indonesia and China, was on Monday frantically investigating reports that the Indian government may have blacklisted it from all defence contracts.\nIndia's defence ministry on Monday ordered the Central Bureau of Investigations (CBI), the country's fraud squad, to investigate claims that Rolls paid bribes to secure government contracts.\nLocal media said all of Rolls' contracts in India had been put on hold pending the outcome of the inquiry. The Hindu suggested ministers had considered blacklisting Rolls from any further deals with the armed forces.\n\"We await clarification from the authorities in India,\" a Rolls spokesman said. \"We have made clear that we will co-operate with the regulators and have been explicit that we will not tolerate misconduct of any sort.\"\nRolls has supplied engines for six types of aircraft in India – AJT Hawk, Jaguar, Avro, Kiran MK-II and Sea Harrier and Sea King Helicopters – and the Indian air force is in the process of agreeing maintenance contracts.\nThe Indian CBI investigation was prompted by a whistleblower who claimed Rolls paid bribes to staff at Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), a state-owned company, to help secure government contracts. Rolls, which appointed Lord Gold, a former City lawyer and Tory party peer, to review its anti-bribery and compliance procedures, is understood to have written to HAL admitting it used a middleman to secure a deal to provide marine gas turbines for power generation.\nThe middleman is accused of having paid bribes in the region of 5bn rupees (£48m), according to Indian media. Indian law bans the use of middlemen or advisers to obtain government deals.\nReports suggested the CBI investigation may be extended to Rolls' contract to supply engines to air force Hawk training jets. The CBI did not respond to requests for comment from the Guardian.\nThe CBI investigation comes weeks after the UK's SFO arrested a prominent Indian businessman and Liberal Democrat donor in London in connection with allegations that Rolls paid bribes in Indonesia and China.\nSudhir Choudhrie and his son Bhanu were arrested and questioned for several hours by the SFO investigating whistleblower claims of corruption at Rolls . Both men were released without charge and deny any wrongdoing. A spokesman for the Choudhries said they were not connected to the Indian CBI investigation.\nSudhir Choudhrie had previously been placed on the CBI's blacklist of \"undesirables … suspected to be resorting to corruption or irregular practices in their dealing with official agencies\".\nThe CBI has investigated Choudhrie over allegations of fraud in relation to arms deals, though they have all been formally closed.\nRolls is battling with an SFO criminal investigation into claims the company used middlemen to bribe the son of Indonesia's former president Suharto with $20m (£13m) and a blue Rolls-Royce car.\nThe allegations were made by former Rolls-Royce employee Dick Taylor in a series of online comments. The Derby-based company is accused of paying bribes in the 1980s and 1990s in order to persuade the national airline, Garuda, to order Rolls-Royce Trent 700 engines.\nLawyers for Tommy Suharto – real name Hutomo Mandala Putra, who was convicted in 2002 of ordering the murder of a judge who tried him on separate corruption charges in 2000 – said: \"He [Suharto] did not, and has never, received monies or a car from Rolls-Royce and nor did he recommend their engines to Garuda, as alleged.\"\nAfter taking early retirement, Taylor decided to \"tell the truth\", and since 2006 has been posting comments below Rolls-Royce articles on newspaper websites around the world, including theguardian.com.\nTaylor, who worked for Rolls for more than 30 years, including a stint in Indonesia, turned whistleblower after the company ignored concerns he raised internally.\nJohn Rishton, Rolls-Royce's chief executive, has stressed that the company will not tolerate illegal conduct. \"I want to make it crystal clear that neither I nor the board will tolerate improper business conduct of any sort and will take all necessary action to ensure compliance,\" he said.\nThe fresh escalation of the bribery investigation into Rolls could prove embarrassing for David Cameron and the royal family, who have spoken of their pride in one of Britain's best-known companies. The prime minister has praised Rolls-Royce as an enterprise \"of which the whole country can be proud\", and the Duke of Cambridge has described it as \"one of the United Kingdom's great global companies\".\nIndia is attempting to crack down on alleged corruption in defence procurement, and last month terminated a £466m helicopter order with the British-Italian company AgustaWestland following accusations that the firm bribed officials.\nThe Indian defence ministry said it was axing its order for 12 helicopters, a variant of the company's anti-submarine warfare model, the AW101 or Merlin, that has been designed to transport high-ranking officials. \"The government of India has terminated with immediate effect the agreement that was signed with AgustaWestland International Ltd (AWIL) on 8 February 2010 for the supply of 12 VVIP/VIP helicopters on grounds of breach of the pre-contract integrity pact and the agreement by AWIL.\"\n"

Yes, in a recent bid to appear more transparent the European commission has released more press briefings and held meetings with civil society organisations, but secrecy over the substance of the treaty remains. There is, for instance, no access to the text of the TTIP itself. Even British MPs are not privy to this. This is evident in the only House of Commons debate so far on the economic implications of the TTIP. Records of the debate reveal that MPs were unable to establish the mandate for the treaty or what was happening in the negotiations. This suggests not only secrecy but something deeply undemocratic about these negotiations.Jan SavageLondon\n• Perhaps Karel De Gucht could tell us how many of the 350 participants at the recent civil society meeting on the EU-US trade deal were from business? This deal favours corporate interests over public services, democracy and the environment. Polly JonesWorld Development Movement\n• Mr De Gucht tells us not to worry that transnational companies will get even greater power over our affairs, because there could be £100bn growth in Europe, which of course means jobs. We're always promised lots of jobs when such deals are being steamrollered though. This rather reminds me of Donald Trump's deal with the Scottish government to build a golf course on the Aberdeenshire coast, promising billions in investment and lots of jobs in exchange for the destruction of a site of special scientific importance (SSSI). The SSSI has indeed been destroyed but the promised investment and jobs, to my knowledge, have never materialised.\nMaybe this negotiation is not secret but, so far as most of the British media are concerned, it might as well be. Perhaps, if De Gucht's assurances are to be believed, the TTIP will not turn out to be quite so malign as George Monbiot (Comment, 3 December) suspects. But I remain sceptical. I can't imagine that our present neoliberal coalition government will do other than welcome the TTIP and hence make no great effort to inform or consult with the British public. It hasn't so far.\nIn a few months' time, assuming the imminent \"gagging law\" comes into effect without substantive amendment, any further debate or opposition will be effectively stifled. De Gucht concludes by saying that we should focus on the facts; unfortunately one man's facts are another man's poison and it may turn out that the British public – not to mention our European fellows – will have been well and truly fracked. Peter WilkinsonLondon \n• Karel De Gucht, the EU trade commissioner, says \"the arbitrators who decide on EU cases must be above suspicion\". Where is he going to find these sea-green incorruptibles? They will almost certainly be establishment figures who tend to side with the big vested interests keeping them in employment.\nThe bribery and corruption scandals at Fifa and the Olympics show how easy it is for multinationals to offer inducements to friends and family of these arbiters; such as fully funded free scholarships, fact-finding missions plus all expenses to exotic destinations.\nIf I had my druthers, all international trade agreements would be Fairtrade, with all products traded to be produced ethically and sustainably, with all labour free to join trade unions to protect working conditions, preferably produced by co-operatives. Ah well, no harm in dreaming!Richard SaddingtonHuddersfield, West Yorkshire\n• Martin Kettle rehashes that old chestnut about welfare reform being the key solution to Europe's woes (We can't rely on Merkel to sort out Europe's problems, Comment, 19 December). He quotes Angela Merkel as saying Europe has 7% of the world's population, 25% of its income and 50% of its welfare spending. The reason Europe has such a high welfare budget is that it is a social democracy and that is what the people want; unlike the rest of the world in which few countries have any welfare scheme at all. Do Kettle and Merkel want a Europe in which old age means poverty and in which healthcare bills can impoverish even the best paid? In other words the abysmal welfare scheme of the US. Last week I had an electrician working at my house who was complaining about the pension changes. He will have to work to 66 to get his pension and, he asked, how will the roofers cope with having to work to 70?Derrick JoadLeeds\n"

        "text": "\nLawyers for four people connected to a mining conglomerate run by one of the world's wealthiest men have launched a groundbreaking legal action against the London-based campaign group Global Witness claiming damages for breaches of data protection rights.\nThe claim, filed at the high court in London last week, was released on Monday and intensifies a long-running dispute over iron ore rights in the west African state of Guinea. The action takes a highly unusual legal approach, alleging that Global Witness has refused to comply with a decision of the UK information commissioner.\nThe claim has been lodged by individuals associated with BSG Resources (BSGR), an international mining group run by the Israeli businessman Beny Steinmetz. It complains that BSGR has been the subject of \"a sustained, negative publicity campaign by Global Witness\", which it claims is closely associated with the billionaire hedge fund manager George Soros.\nGlobal Witness, which was founded in 1993, has dismissed the legal action as an attempt to stifle journalism and investigations carried out in the public interest. The row over the Simandou iron ore mines project in south-east Guinea has been covered by the Guardian.\nSteinmetz's wealth is estimated to be worth more than $4bn (£2.6bn). The claim has been served in his name and those of three others associated with BSGR, which is based in St Peter Port, Guernsey.\nDag Cramer, CEO of Onyx Financial Advisers, an adviser to BSGR and one of the others who have brought the action, said: \"We tried for more than a year to avoid this outcome, because we consider Global Witness's declared aims to be laudable. Unfortunately, the organisation has entirely failed to live up to its own principles. It is hopelessly compromised, and out of control.\n\"Global Witness's refusal to tell us what personal data it has on us is a breach of the law and is deeply discomfiting to me and my fellow claimants. It feels like a personal violation. It is ironic that this NGO, which claims to value transparency above all else, refuses to make itself accountable by complying with transparency laws.\"\nThe high court claim says the claimants submitted subject access requests to Global Witness under the Data Protection Act during 2012 and 2013, seeking details of personal data about Steinmetz and his colleagues held by Global Witness.\nThe document says the campaign group has refused to give a description or disclose the information it holds on them. It notes that Global Witness refused on the grounds that it was exempt as the information was held \"with a view to journalistic publication\".\nThe BSGR claimants say they are giving notice to Global Witness to \"cease, or not to begin, processing the claimants' personal data\" on a number of grounds, including that \"it has involved the association by the defendant of the named claimants with the unfounded allegations of bribery and corruption on the part of BSGR or its associated entities\".\nGlobal Witness, which campaigns against abuses in the exploitation of natural resources around the world, said in response to the claim: \"Global Witness intends to robustly defend its position and regards the claim as an attempt to stifle journalism in the public interest.\n\"Global Witness has been investigating and reporting for over a year on how BSGR obtained rights to one of the world's largest iron ore deposits, the Simandou iron ore mine in Guinea. We have highlighted serious corruption concerns surrounding the deal, explaining in detail the reasons for our findings and asking questions of the companies concerned at every stage.\n\"BSGR still has not explained important aspects of its Simandou deal, notably the ownership of secretive companies associated with it. Rather than seeking to bully those raising legitimate concerns, BSGR should address these matters directly.\"\n• This article was amended on 17 December 2013 to clarify that the action was brought by individuals associated with BSGR, not the company.\n"

        "text": "\nThe Liberal Democrats were mired in a fresh donor row when it emerged that one of the party's biggest benefactors is an international arms dealer listed on the Indian fraud squad's blacklist of \"undesirables\".\nSudhir Choudhrie, who has donated more than £500,000 to the Lib Dems via his family company since 2010, was named by India's Central Bureau of Investigation as one of 23 \"unscrupulous persons\" in 2012, the Guardian can reveal.\nHowever, the Lib Dems accepted donations from Choudhrie as recently as November 2013, when his C&C Alpha Group family company donated £30,000 [see footnote]. His family and companies have donated more than £500,000 since 2010.\nChoudhrie's activities were thrown into the spotlight this week when he and his son Bhanu were arrested and questioned for several hours by the Serious Fraud Office in connection with an investigation into allegations of multimillion pound bribery and corruption at Rolls-Royce, which supplies engines for military and civilian jets. Sudhir Choudhrie has always denied claims that he is an arms dealer.\nThe revelations about the Indian businessman come as a growing network of links between the Choudhrie family and the Lib Dems emerged.\n• Nick Clegg and his wife Miriam hosted an event in 2011 for Choudhrie's charity, Path To Success, in Lancaster House, London, an official government residence.\n• Justice minister Simon Hughes received a £60,000 donation in November 2013 after a request for the cash.\n• Bhanu's wife, Simrin Choudhrie, says on her LinkedIn page that she worked as a campaign assistant in Hughes's office on his 2004 mayoral campaign and \"later assisted Simon with the bid to host the Olympics in 2012\".\n• Danny Alexander, chief secretary to the Treasury, visited Choudhrie's home last year during an official government trip to India.\nLib Dem sources said the party had no knowledge that Choudhrie was on the CBI list of people \"suspected to be resorting to corrupt or irregular practices in their dealings with official agencies\".\nThe sources said the party had done full due diligence on the Choudhries along with other donors before the last election in 2010. At this point, they were given documentation – a chit – showing that Sudhir Choudhrie had been cleared of all allegations against him in India. The sources said the party only found out about Choudhrie and his son's arrest on Wednesday from newspaper reports.\nIt is understood Clegg has met Choudhrie many times as he has been a major donor for a decade, but they could not be described as personal friends.\n\"The Choudhrie family are long-term party supporters and donors. Sudhir Choudhrie has met Nick Clegg and other senior party figures on a number of occasions,\" one aide said.\nThe Indian-born businessman, who lives in a £5m apartment in Chelsea, was placed on the Indian list of \"unscrupulous persons\" following two formal investigations of alleged bribery in Choudhrie's work brokering arms deals.\nChoudhrie was investigated and later cleared of allegations he accepted a $150,000 (£90,000) commission as part of an arms deal with the Israeli company Soltam in 2000.\nThe Indian CBI also investigated claims that Choudhrie and his companies received \"a number of suspected remittances to the tune of millions of dollars\" from arms firm Israel Aircraft Industries over a deal to supply seven Barak missile systems and 200 missiles to the Indian navy [see footnote]. The CBI closed its seven-year investigation into the allegations on 24 December 2013 due to a lack of evidence.\nThe \"Undesirable Contactmen\" list, which was prepared by the CBI and distributed to all Indian government departments, states politicians and officials should be \"careful and cautious in dealings with unscrupulous contact men whose names are on these lists, to avoid associating with them socially and accepting hospitality and gifts from them.\n\"Even official dealings with the UCM should be discouraged. Nefarious activities of these individuals should not be allowed and they should not be allowed sponsorship of Govt projects.\"\nThe Choudhries' spokesman confirmed that the list, seen by the Guardian, was genuine but said there was \"no reason why Mr Choudhrie is still on such a list\".\nHe said Choudhrie was probably placed on the list while the CBI was conducting its inquiries, and could have been removed from it now that both investigations have been \"formally closed\". The Indian CBI did not respond to requests for comment.\nOf the Choudhries' arrests in connection with the Rolls-Royce bribery scandal, the spokesman said: \"The allegations made against Bhanu and Sudhir Choudhrie are strongly denied. Full co-operation is being given to the authorities.\"\nRolls-Royce is alleged to have used middlemen to bribe Tommy Suharto, the son of Indonesia's former president General Suharto, with $20m (£13m) and a blue Rolls-Royce car.\nJohn Rishton, Rolls-Royce's chief executive, has stressed that the company will not tolerate illegal conduct. He said: \"I want to make it crystal clear that neither I nor the board will tolerate improper business conduct of any sort and will take all necessary action to ensure compliance.\"\nChoudhrie, who is in his 70s, was named by Clegg as a potential future peer last year. Last autumn it was reported that he had fallen off the prospective peer list following a damning official report into hospitals and care homes he owns.\nThe arrests of the Choudhries in connection with allegations of bribery is particularly embarrassing for the Lib Dems because it comes after major donor Michael Brown was sentenced to seven years in jail for theft, furnishing false information and perverting the course of justice. After nearly four years on the run, Brown, who gave the party £2.4m in 2005, was sent to prison in 2012. The party has not paid the money back.\nThe escalation of the SFO's Rolls-Royce bribery investigation could also prove embarrassing for David Cameron and the royal family, who have spoken of their pride in one of Britain's best-known companies.\nThe prime minister has praised Rolls-Royce as an enterprise \"of which the whole country can be proud\", and the Duke of Cambridge has described it as \"one of the United Kingdom's great global companies\".\nAdditional reporting by Solomon Hughes\n • This footnote was further amended on 9 July 2014. Since publication, a spokesman for Mr Sudhir Choudhrie has pointed out that neither Mr Choudhrie nor his company were named as suspects in relation to the CBI investigation into the purchase of Barak missiles. Mr Sudhir Choudhrie ceased to be a director of any of the Group's companies in 2007. There is no evidence to suggest that Mr Choudhrie's peerage was blocked because of the 2013 Care Quality Commission report into a hospital owned by C&C Alpha Group. \n"

        "text": "\nShares in Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation (ENRC) slipped sharply on Monday as the FTSE 100 miner outlined details of last week's spurned takeover bid by its oligarch founders and the Kazakhstan government.\nThe company, which is under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office over allegations of \"fraud, bribery and corruption relating to the activities of the company or its subsidiaries in Kazakhstan and Africa\", was pushed into a further disclosure after details of the proposal leaked into the market on Friday night.\nIt said the offer – pitched by the trio of founding shareholders of Alexander Machkevitch, Alijan Ibragimov and Patokh Chodiev, alongside the Kazakh government – consisted of 175p-a-share of cash plus 0.231 shares in fellow miner Kazakhmys for every existing share in ENRC. ENRC added that the proposal \"materially undervalues ENRC\".\nThe shares in Kazakhmys being used as part of the deal are owned by the Kazakh state and their inclusion throws up two quirks: firstly, Kazakhmys owns 26% of ENRC so is being offered shares in itself; and secondly the offer prompted an intervention from the Takeover Panel on Monday, as it ruled that Kazakhmys is now part of the bidding party even though it is not bidding itself. That will mean that significant investors in Kazakhmys will now have to disclose when they trade the shares.\nENRC said the constituent parts of the offer equated to a total price of 260p per ENRC share. The company's shares lost 2.76% on Monday to close at 264.1p.\n"

        "text": "\nThe three billionaire founders of controversial Kazakh mining company Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation are poised to unveil a final but reduced £3bn bid before a deadline on Monday.\nThe oligarchs, Alexander Machkevitch, Alijan Ibragimov and Patokh Chodiev, made a tentative proposal in May worth around £3.3bn, which was rejected by ENRC's independent directors.\nThe offer involved a mixture of cash plus shares from the Kazakh government's stake in rival London-listed mining group Kazakhmys. Under the new proposal, the structure remains the same but the total price is lower following a fall in Kazakhmys shares since May. To complicate matters further, Kazakhmys itself holds a 26% stake in ENRC.\nIn a statement on Sunday the oligarchs said: \"In response to the recent press speculation, the consortium confirms that it is in the advanced stages of preparation of a possible offer to be made for the entire issued and to be issued share capital of ENRC. It is a pre-condition that Kazakhmys delivers an irrevocable undertaking to accept the offer (subject to Kazakhmys shareholder approval) in respect of [its stake in ENRC].\"\nThe consortium is offering 172.3p in cash plus 0.23 Kazakhmys shares. Based on Friday's price of 269.4p for Kazakhmys shares, it values each ENRC share at around 234.3p compared to its latest market price of 216.9p.\nBut the original proposal was worth 260p for every ENRC share, which ENRC's independent directors had already rejected as \"materially undervaluing\" the business.\nHowever, there is little they can do if Kazakhmys decides to put its 26% shareholding behind the bidders, which it is reportedly minded to do. Between them, the oligarchs and the Kazakh government already own 53.9% so any deal with Kazakhmys would see the offer go unconditional.\nThe ENRC founders decided to take the company private amid investigations by the Serious Fraud Office over fraud, bribery and corruption allegations, boardroom rows and an acquisition spree which left it with around $5bn (£3.24bn) of debt.\n"

Their receipt follows a \"section 2 notice\" issued by the SFO that compelled Dechert to hand over documents.\nENRC split from Dechert in the spring and shortly afterwards the SFO launched its criminal investigation into ENRC, saying it would be focusing on allegations of \"fraud, bribery and corruption relating to the activities of the company or its subsidiaries in Kazakhstan and Africa\".\nIn its half-year results statement released on Wednesday, ENRC said: \"The first notice requires the delivery of certain Dechert materials by the end of August 2013 and the second notice requires that the remainder of the Dechert materials are submitted to the SFO by the end of October 2013. The group continues to cooperate fully with the SFO and are committed to a full and transparent investigation of all of our procedures and conduct.\" The statement was made as Felix Vulis, ENRC's chief executive, fronted what should be the £3bn company's final results statement to the City, as the group is almost certain to de-list its shares from the London Stock Exchange by October.\nENRC is in the process of being taken private by a consortium involving the company's three founding shareholders and the Kazakhstan state, collectively holding about 55% of the shares. The bid has received the backing of ENRC's largest shareholder, its neighbour and rival Kazakhmys, which owns a 26% stake.\nThe bid to take the company private followed a string of high profile problems within the mining firm in addition to the SFO investigation. They have included: two continuing inquiries by the UK Listing Authority; the founders ousting independent directors from the board; and ENRC launching a legal action against a former director for allegedly leaking company information.\nHowever, when asked how he thought London had treated ENRC as a public company, Vulis insisted: \"That's an interesting question. First of all we are still here. Second, we are very much enjoying being here in the City and very much enjoyed the time. Hopefully the City has enjoyed us as much as we have enjoyed the City.\"\nVulis said first half pre-tax profits had halved to $309m (£199m), from $696m last year. The slump was partly caused by the decreasing value of subsidiary Boss Mining in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which was written down by $152m as the company has pulled investment from the business to concentrate on higher priority projects.\n"

In some circumstances companies can be considered for immunity from prosecution if they can demonstrate they have been pro-active and alerted SFO investigators to evidence of wrongdoing immediately they learned of it.\nA spokesman for GSK would not answer questions about contact with the SFO, saying only: \"We are keeping all regulators up to date as appropriate.\"\nPolice are examining allegations that GSK is at the heart of an alleged £320m bribery network, siphoning payments and perks to health officials and doctors through more than 700 \"travel agencies\", tasked with organising conferences for doctors. Some reports over the weekend suggested the substantive allegations centred on as few as 25 such agencies.\nGSK was described by Chinese officials as playing a \"godfather\" role at the centre of these agent companies. However, Witty is likely to tell investors on Wednesday that GSK's compliance team in China has been challenged by the scale of his company's growth there. Keeping track of the activities of all agents has been tough and he has already instigated a review of \"all third party relationships\".\nSales in China grew 20% to £1bn last year and Witty quipped to City analysts in February that controlling operations in the country was \"not a trivial proposition\".\nA British national and nine others – all working for a corporate intelligence firm – were reported over the weekend to have been arrested as part of the investigation into GSK.\nPolice had previously arrested four Chinese GSK executives and have raised concerns about the timing of a flight out of the country taken by the drug firm's regional boss Mark Reilly shortly after the corruption inquiry was announced on 27 June. He has not returned since. Reilly's finance director, Steve Nechelput, has been banned from leaving China by the authorities.\nLast year Witty reached a $3bn deal with criminal prosecutors in the US and GSK pleaded guilty to a raft of offences linked to the illegal promotion of its drugs in America. Many of the allegations related to extravagant travel provided to doctors whose business GSK was courting.\nAfter securing the settlement, Witty said: \"In recent years, we have fundamentally changed our procedures for compliance, marketing and selling in the US to ensure that we operate with high standards of integrity and that we conduct our business openly and transparently.\"\n"

        "text": "\nHow is Twitter worth $40bn? \nThe microblogging site floated in November at $26 (£16) a share, or $17bn. The price seemed silly for a company that has never made a profit and is on course for revenues of only $600m this year. Yet the share price is now close to $70. Twitter is plainly a social phenomenon but has yet to show it can take a meaningful chunk of online advertising without infuriating users. The valuation of 60-times revenues is otherworldly; it may also be evidence that heavy doses of quantitative easing have messed up traditional investment radars.\nWhy was the Co-op Bank farce allowed to run for so long? \nThe Rev Paul Flowers, dubbed the \"Crystal Methodist\" after allegations of drug use, generated the bulk of the headlines. The mystery, however, is why regulators allowed a severely under-capitalised and under-managed Co-op Bank to try to buy 630 branches from Lloyds. The expedition was finally abandoned in April and a £1.5bn capital hole revealed soon afterwards. We are still awaiting a full explanation of why regulators didn't intervene earlier.\nHow did Help to Buy, mark two, ever get off the ground? \nArguably, the first version of the chancellor's housing scheme, confined to creditworthy first-time buyers, was semi-respectable. The second version, however, involves the state writing first-loss insurance on house purchases worth up to £600,000. Why? House prices are rising again – at an annual rate of 10% in London – and affordability is already stretched if historical price-to-earnings ratios are a guide. Meanwhile, the emergency Funding for Lending scheme for banks is being axed for mortgages. George Osborne is making it harder for the Bank of England to prevent a housing bubble.\nWhy isn't the growth of zero-hours contracts an election issue? \nFlexibility in the labour force is an asset and some workers are clearly content with contracts that offer no guarantee of regular work. But, when 1 million people may be employed this way, a large swath of the UK workforce has been quietly casualised. In some cases, workers may be exploited by being denied holiday and sickness pay. The effect on productivity could be long-lasting. The lack of intensity in the political debate is mystifying.\nHow do investment banks continue to charge so much? \nThe question could be asked most years, but 2013 brought two startling examples. Barclays shelled out a colossal £130m in fees to other banks who took little real risk in underwriting a deeply discounted £6bn rights issue. And Severn Trent managed to clock up £19m in \"advisory, legal and other services\" in a single month in resisting a takeover approach that never became a formal bid. For comparison, it cost £4.8m to run the water company's board, comprising five executives and six non-executive directors, for a full year.\nIs the eurozone crisis really over? \nThe Cyprus banks crisis was handled crassly at the start of the year. Since then, the wider eurozone crisis has seemed becalmed, despite the continued economic funk in euroland. Greece is still the country to watch. Deflation could quickly undermine the ambition of reducing public debt (now 170% of GDP) if nominal GDP grows only slowly. In that case, a third bailout, and write-offs of loans, may be required. That messy debate could again be alive this time next year.\nDoes GlaxoSmithKline have a future in China? \nBack in July, when allegations of bribery and corruption were made against GSK's Chinese unit, a fine and a rapid restructuring of working practices seemed a likely outcome. Five months on, investigations continue, dozens of local employees remain in detention and chief executive Sir Andrew Witty has not been able to draw a line. He says there is \"no question\" about GSK's commitment to China. But the question of how the commitment is meant to be achieved is unresolved.\nCan Ed Miliband's proposed freeze on energy bills be made credible? \nThe idea to cap fuel bills for 20 months is popular; it even prompted the government to make a minor tweak of green levies. But does a price freeze, regardless of what happens to the wholesale price of energy, stand any chance of working in practice? How would Labour oblige energy firms to invest in new infrastructure? Would firms really be allowed to set their own tariffs in the 21st month? The answer is supposed to be \"yes\" because the energy market would have been \"re-set\" in a fair and transparent way. That is ambitious, to put it mildly. The plan needs much more detail.\nIs it safe to taper? \nThis is the big one for global markets. The US Federal Reserve has started to ease back on quantitative easing, even if the change of gears is hardly crunching – there will be a $10bn monthly reduction to $75bn. But the expectation of a full and gradual wind-down of asset purchases has been created. If the US recovery proves too weak to allow a full taper, the Fed is in trouble.\nHow does Jamie Dimon survive at JP Morgan? \nThe US bank paid a record $13bn to settle with the US justice department for mis-selling mortgage securities. There were also fines of $920m relating to the \"London Whale\" incident, which Dimon initially dismissed as a \"tempest in a teapot\" but which led to a $6bn loss. he Financial Conduct Authority saying it was \"deliberately misled\" by London-based executives on one occasion. Dimon, though, remains as chairman and chief executive of JP Morgan. Shareholders and regulators, bizarrely, continue to approve the concentration of power.\nDoes Labour really believe in HS2? \nThe proposed high-speed rail line had a bad year.

        "text": "\nExecutives working for the UK drug maker GlaxoSmithKline in China have confessed to \"serious\" corruption and tax-related offences, China's security ministry said on Thursday, amid a wide-ranging series of investigations into foreign firms operating in the country.\nThe allegations, which the ministry classified as \"serious economic crimes\", include the bribing of doctors and officials in order to \"open new sales channels and increase drug revenues\". The employees are also claimed to have used fake receipts to violate tax regulations, according to a statement on the ministry's website. It did not reveal the employees' identities, how many were detained or when they were questioned.\n\"After initial questioning the suspects have admitted to the crimes, and the investigation is ongoing,\" the statement said, adding that police were carrying out investigations in Shanghai, Zhengzhou and Changsha, where GSK employees – whose identities have not been revealed – were detained two weeks ago on charges of fraud.\nA spokesman for GSK rejected the charges, saying: \"We take all allegations of bribery and corruption seriously. We continuously monitor our businesses to ensure they meet our strict compliance procedures. We have done this in China and found no evidence of bribery or corruption of doctors or government officials. However, if evidence of such activity is provided we will act swiftly on it.\"\nHe added: \"We are willing to co-operate with the authorities in this inquiry. But this is the first official communication GSK has received from the PSB [public security bureau] in relation to the specific nature of its investigation.\"\nA spokesman for the Foreign Office said: \"We are aware of the Chinese investigation and we are in contact with GSK and the Chinese authorities.\"\nThe allegations follow similar claims that GSK sales staff in China showered doctors with money, dinners and all-expenses paid trips in promoting its Botox anti-wrinkle treatment.\nThe Botox allegations, reported in the Wall Street Journal following a tip-off from an anonymous source, centred on claims that GSK marketing staff in China had planned to pay doctors up to $490 (£325) for meeting prescription quotas between 2004-2010.\nThere is no evidence any payments were made and GSK's spokesman said the company had looked thoroughly at these allegations and had found nothing.\nGSK's sales in China account for 3% of the group's turnover, but are expected to grow.\nThe allegations come as Beijing conducts a series of investigations into foreign companies across an array of industries. European and US-based companies Mead Johnson, Nestle and Danone have cut their infant milk formula prices in recent days amid a major government investigation into alleged price fixing. Earlier this year Chinese media targeted Apple and Volkswagon in scathing consumer rights investigations.\n"

Details about the siege have been slow to emerge, not least rumours about the identities of the attackers, while the only organisation to claim responsibility has been al-Shabaab, an al-Qaida inspired Islamic group that has emerged from the anarchic state of Somalia.\nIn our cover story this week, the Guardian's Simon Tisdall takes a closer look at this faction-riven group, the rise of its new and shadowy leader, Ahmed Abdi Godane, what al-Shabaab hopes to achieve by striking at targets outside Somalia – and who might be next on its list.\nIt was a triumphant election week for Angela Merkel, who won a historic third term as chancellor of Germany, though uncertainty remains over the make-up of the new ruling coalition. Guardian Berlin correspondent Philip Oltermann breaks down the result. Across Europe, meanwhile, Greeks watched the German election anxiously as the \"troika\" of European lenders arrived in Athens to assess whether the country's debt-ridden economy required a third bailout.\nOn a lighter note, Le Monde has visited Pisa in Italy where, after years of careful underpinning work, the town's famous leaning tower is now listing slightly less.\nAs Iran's Hassan Rouhani addressed the United Nations in New York for the first time, ordinary Iranians are daring to dream that the new president's charm offensive to the west may have some real substance behind it. From China, meanwhile, comes a tale of leadership gone rotten with former Communist party official Bo Xilai sentenced to life in prison for bribery and corruption.\nFollowing last week's UN inspectors' visit to Syria, we have a special report on the deadly history of sarin, the chemical weapon at the centre of international anger. Also an interesting analysis of why August's poison-gas attack in Damascus may have significantly strengthened president Bashar al-Assad's hand in the civil war.\nIn the UK, a year before Scotland goes to the polls to vote on independence, Guardian economics correspondent Phillip Inman reports from Glasgow where business remains divided on the economic merits of freedom from the union. His colleague Larry Elliott, meanwhile, asks whether London shouldn't be hived off into a separate city state while we're at it.\nThere's a real treat in the Review section this week as the Observer's Andrew Anthony locks horns with the world's most famous atheist, Richard Dawkins. This is an interview that made me laugh out loud in places, so I can only hope you enjoy it as much as I did. We also have a fascinating spread about property booms and busts in various parts of the world, including the small US city planning to take on the wrath of the Wall Street lenders.\nFurther back, we look at how ever-advancing cinematic special effects are breathing new life into the superhero genre. In Books we review Simon Schama's history of the Jewish people, and in Discover we find out how the humble zebrafish has more in common with human beings than it – or we – could possibly have imagined.\nIn Notes and Queries we ponder why Britain's navy and air force are \"Royal\" but its army isn't.

        "text": "\nThe Pelé of football writing is not Brazilian but Uruguayan, a citizen of the small country that had already won the World Cup twice before its larger neighbour got off the mark. His name is Eduardo Galeano, and almost 20 years ago he wrote a marvellous book called Football in Sun and Shadow, full of warmth, wit and an appreciation of the humanity of great footballers. (The Maradona of football writing, incidentally, is not only Argentinian but actually played alongside God's handyman in the 1986 World Cup-winning team: a volume of the collected works of Jorge Valdano, originally written for this newspaper and others, is expected next year.)\nIt was Galeano, writing about the tumultuous 1950 final in Rio de Janeiro, who recalled that the members of the Brazil team, playing at home and odds-on favourites to win the trophy for the first time, had been given watches before the match, inscribed \"For the world champions\". They lost 2-1 to Uruguay in a contest that, as the authors of every book about Brazilian football cannot fail to note, became known as the Maracanazo: the disaster of the Maracanã stadium, a day that silenced not only 200,000 spectators but the entire country, dealing a profound blow to its fragile self-esteem.\n\"Brazil had been spared the real slaughter of industrialised war, preferring news of Flamengo [the Rio football club] to the battle of Stalingrad,\" David Goldblatt writes in Futebol Nation. \"Now football was the metaphor for exploring the consequences of defeat and devastation.\" Poor Moacir Barbosa, Brazil's black goalkeeper, was blamed for letting in Uruguay's winning goal, and subsequently ostracised; in Shocking Brazil, Fernando Duarte describes the toll it took on the figure to whom his book is dedicated. \"The highest sentence for a crime in Brazil is 30 years,\" the embittered and penniless Barbosa remarked before his death in 2000. \"I have already served that.\" He was named goalkeeper of the tournament by neutral judges, but after he was deceived by Alcide Ghiggia's shot it would be 56 years before another black goalkeeper was chosen to represent a country that prides itself on (and is deluded about) its colour-blindness.\nThis month, Brazil is hosting the tournament for the first time since that traumatic event, and the possibility of a repeat of 1950 haunts the dreams of a country in which, as the World Cup-winning coach Carlos Alberto Parreira once told me with a weary shrug: \"Every single citizen is a selector.\" Crowned world champions five times on foreign fields from Sweden to Japan in the intervening decades, their habitual pre-tournament anxiety is exacerbated by the knowledge that, once again, playing at home should confer an advantage. The current team glitters, as usual, with individual talent; above all, that of Neymar da Silva Santos Júnior, the 22-year-old forward who joined Barcelona a year ago for a massive transfer fee in a deal so murky that it is under investigation by the Madrid public prosecutor's office. Should Brazil encounter Uruguay in the final, or more likely their other neighbours, Argentina (who for the first time in history will have a pope on their side, as well as Lionel Messi), there will be not a packet of sedatives left for sale from Manaus to Porto Alegre.\nAs usual, the world waits to see whether Brazil will display the glories of futebol arte, the rapturously expressive game associated with the winning teams in which Pelé starred, or the brute realities of futebol dá força, the more pragmatic, defensively minded style that prevailed in 1994, when Parreira was vilified for leaving an 18-year-old prodigy named Ronaldo on the sidelines. These antithetical approaches are both identified with moments of dramatic failure: that of futebol dá força in 1974, when the team was unrecognisable from the champions of only four years earlier, despite containing some of the same players, and that of futebol arte in 1982, when an extravagantly gifted side proved unable to fulfil its manifest destiny.\nThe first book on this subject that anyone should read is Alex Bellos's inventive Futebol: The Brazilian Way of Life, which first appeared in 2002 and has just been republished by Bloomsbury. But, like Brazilian football itself, this is a story that admits many approaches. In Futebol Nation, Goldblatt examines in absorbing detail the special place of the sport in the country's history, from the impact made by Charles Miller, the son of a Scottish father and an Anglo-Brazilian mother, who returned from his English public school in 1894 with two footballs and a copy of the rules of the game, through the rise in the 1960s of the torcidas organizadas, the powerful supporters' groups that became a law unto themselves, to the demonstrations held in protest against lavish government expenditure on this summer's tournament in a country whose poor still live in hovels. His conclusions are mostly sombre: past victories, he writes, \"have been bought at the cost of making Brazil's divisions and its injustices starker than ever\".\nIn Shocking Brazil, Duarte – who writes about South American football for this newspaper – tells the story of the green-and-yellows through their defeats, a starting point that allows him to dwell at length on the experience of 1982, when a team including the exquisite talents of Zico, Sócrates and Paulo Roberto Falcão was eliminated after losing 3-2 to Italy, to the dismay of purists around the world. \"We had a hell of a team and played with happiness,\" Sócrates said. \"Then we came across the Italians. [Paolo] Rossi had three touches and scored a hat-trick. Football as we had known it died that day.\"\nHe was wrong, fortunately for those of us who love the game, although subsequent generations of Brazilian heroes seem to have lived, like Ronaldo, permanently at the mercy of capricious fate: ignored in 1994, the victim of a mysterious panic attack on the day of the 1998 final, redeemed by scoring both his country's goals against Germany in 2002. The latest contender for immortality is mentioned in the subtitle – Pelé, Neymar and Brazil's Beautiful Game – of the Swedish journalist Henrik Brandão Jönsson's Jogo Bonito, which borrows a now threadbare epithet for its main title but is nevertheless distinguished by its entertaining originality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Pelé celebrates winning the World Cup in 1970. Photograph: Colorsport/Rex\n\n\nJönsson, who has spent the past decade in Brazil, encounters Neymar when the player is in his final weeks with Santos, his Brazilian club, before the move to Europe. He knows that the player has been learning English and Spanish, so he decides to ask questions in both languages. \"If his English is good,\" he muses, \"it means Chelsea has the best chance of catching him. If he answers in Spanish, it will mean rumours of a preliminary contract with Barcelona hold water.\"\nThe author interrogates the great – including Mário Zagallo, a World Cup winner as a player and a coach; Sócrates, who tried to turn Corinthians, the São Paulo club he captained, into the model of a new democracy; and Romário, the hero of 1994 who is now a socialist member of the chamber of deputies and a leading critic of Brazil's World Cup – and the good and not so good of the game, as well as those on the periphery. \"If Neymar wears his cap on one side,\" a TV producer tells him, \"the next day it's the new trend. If he dances in a certain way, everyone copies him. If he wears a checked shirt, everyone wants one. Everything he touches turns to gold.\"\nHe also spends time among the fans and takes a trip to Manaus, where England will play their opening match against Italy. He finds that while it is indeed as hot and humid as advertised, the city in the midst of the rainforest presents other challenges. \"Respect for the word of the law is at its weakest in Amazonas,\" he reports. \"The tentacles of the judicial system seldom find their way here, and residents are used to taking the law into their own hands.\" Roy Hodgson has been warned.\nThere is, of course, more to Latin American football than simply Brazil's grip on the imagination of fans around the world. In ¡Golazo!, Andreas Campomar, who has worked in publishing in London for many years, plaits together the stories of the game in Colombia, Bolivia, Mexico, Chile, Peru and Ecuador, as well as those of the World Cup-winning nations. His survey of these post-colonial societies does not neglect the traces of early British influence, such as the borrowing of the black and yellow colours of George Stephenson's Rocket for the shirts of the Uruguayan club, originally formed to play cricket, that would become the powerful Peñarol; or the survival in Argentina of a team called Newell's Old Boys (for whom Maradona briefly appeared while trying to get fit for the 1994 tournament).\nCampomar is a compatriot of Galeano, who is quoted on the opening page and whose benign influence hovers over the book. A Uruguayan perspective makes a pleasant change from the dominance of Brazil, not least at the end of a season in which the English Premier League's best player was Luis Suárez, Liverpool's devilishly gifted forward, whose virtues and vices reflect those of his nation's football: a combination of skill, tenacity, cunning and violence that enables him to score goals of breathtaking audacity but also led to his first red card at the age of 15, for headbutting a referee.\nThe first World Cup to be held in South America since 1978, when Argentina's captain, Daniel Passarella, received the trophy from the hands of General Jorge Videla in Buenos Aires, is again bringing the spotlight to bear on a host nation's political and social realities. Already, there are reports from Brazil of a sudden rise in the murder rate in residential areas whose police forces have been redeployed for the duration of the tournament, largely to ensure the swift suppression of anti-government demonstrations.\nOn the other hand, there was the sight of Neymar on television the other day, during a training session, running up to take a penalty and, as he shaped to shoot with his right foot, somehow contriving – in the same movement – to prod it past the goalkeeper with his left. One moment like that when the real thing starts, one moment of magic, of jogo bonito, of futebol arte, of whatever you want to call the sort of sublime trickery that has children in their millions trying to copy it … what these books share is the knowledge that such a vision would be enough to justify the whole hideous carnival of bribery and corruption, of obscene expenditure and the absurd deification of young men. Or so, in that instant of heart-lifting beauty, we would persuade ourselves.\n• To order Futebol Nation for £7.99, Shocking Brazil for £10.39, Jogo Bonito for £11.99, and Golazo! for £16 with free UK p&p call Guardian book service on 0330 333 6846 or go to guardianbookshop.co.uk.\n"

        "text": "\nOn Saturday morning at 9am a convoy of 80 coaches will trundle away from Hull's KC Stadium going south to Wembley and on the M1 a thousand car wing mirrors will stream with amber flags. In 110 years of sweat and struggle since their club was formed in 1904, the supporters have never been able to say this before: Hull City are in the FA Cup final. Fans have been posting pictures of their tickets on the internet, ecstatic that they bear Hull City's name for a final against the football aristocracy of Arsenal.\nAt the end of a Premier League season in which the club's name has sparked a divisive tussle with the owner, Assem Allam, who planned to change it to Hull Tigers, they have all come together now, hoping their colours are on the cup.\nTheir manager Steve Bruce, having retained the club's Premier League status for next season, said this week that Hull's presence against Arsenal is a \"classic\" FA Cup contest, a reminder of the competition's \"beauty\" which has faded in the Premier League's shadow over recent years. Bruce, in tandem with his longest serving player, Liam Rosenior, talked earnestly this week about how much the final means to a tough, economically neglected city trying to resurrect its fortunes.\n\"Just five minutes from the stadium you will see there is not much money, there has been no investment in the area for a long time,\" said Rosenior, who was the Allam regime's first signing in October 2010. \"The people here are proud, though, and to have a team representing them in the FA Cup final means the world to them. For me to be part of it is really special.\"\nIan Ashbee, the former captain who attained the extraordinary career achievement of playing for Hull City up through all four divisions between 2002 and 2011, said people are \"ecstatic\". He played at the old, creaking Boothferry Park ground, where \"the fans were always very loyal; they turned up in big numbers\", but \"never would have dreamt that 12 years later they would get to an FA Cup final\".\nThe supporters are struggling with their disbelief after all the club has been through: existence-threatening administration in 2001, the bottom division as recently as 2004, dicing with liquidation again after relegation from the Premier League in 2010. Bob Horton, who runs the official supporters club's Driffield branch – fondly nicknamed \"heart attack Bob\" after suffering two coronaries during Hull City matches – shattered his ankle last week but will be at Wembley for this once-in-a-lifetime event.\nThe romance of a northern city with the bunting out, decamping for the FA Cup final in London, is almost as old as the professional game itself. But Hull's long journey to Wembley has more dimensions than just a gleeful day out. There are the prices, which at the top rate have been too much for Hull fans – the club has sold its entire 25,000 allocation of tickets except for some of the £115 best seats. The return coach journey to Wembley is £31, which the club says it is doing at cost, but there have been complaints nonetheless from the many fans who have already forked out for tickets at £85 a time.\nHull's civic leaders have dug into their historic character and found a voice recently, unifying the old shipping and fishing hardiness, the heritage of the poet Philip Larkin and the anti-slavery campaigner William Wilberforce to land City of Culture status for 2017. Pauline Davis, the council's deputy chief executive, standing on Tuesday outside the Ferens Art Gallery, one of the cultural gems councillors show visitors when pressing their case, said: \"There has always been a pride in Hull and now, with having a Premier League football team, at Wembley and in Europe next season, and being City of Culture, we are looking out again, creating hope in the future.\"\nDavis acknowledges that Hull is \"10 years behind\" Manchester, Leeds and Liverpool in its recovery efforts in the wake of industrial decline but in a grand Victorian city square markedly less bustling than in those cities it seemed more like 20 at least. After Manchester became expert in the 1990s at bidding for whatever grants and lottery money were going for the battered provinces, it bagged a new arena, concert hall, conference centres, a tram system, and the 2002 Commonwealth Games, including its £127m stadium, which ultimately attracted Abu Dhabi money to Manchester City. Hull got nothing at all. The Deep, Hull's popular aquarium attraction, was a millennium project.\nAfter fishing and its associated industries collapsed and the port, although still flourishing, became highly mechanised, Hull never found economic ballast. Public administration, education and health were marooned as the biggest employers. Since 2010 the government has cut £104m from the council's budget, with a further £48m going this year and next. Hull has the highest proportion of people on jobseekers allowance (6.6%) in the country, and 22% of people aged 16-64 are economically inactive. A decision by the German company, Siemens, to site a new wind turbine factory in the city has been welcome but government delays and funding reductions for windfarms mean the expected new jobs, 3,000 including at supply companies, are far fewer than the 10,000 originally planned for.\nHull City, like many Premier League clubs now, looms like a multimillion pound island of glitz, fenced off from its rundown surroundings, rather than a football flagship for the people. But Rosenior says he and his handsomely paid team-mates are aware of the realities around them. \"There are misconceptions about footballers, that we're all womanisers, drinkers, gamblers,\" he said. \"Most footballers are working class lads, who have to be honest and work hard to get to this level, and our team is like that. We see the poverty in this area, a lot of people on the breadline, and we hope we're helping to re-invigorate some pride. Most footballers are just normal guys that are living their dreams. I'm playing in an FA Cup final on Saturday and that is what I wanted to do from the age of five.\"\nOne reason Rosenior is living that dream is because, amid all the grim decline, the council found the money to give a great gift to the club – the KC Stadium. With no government or lottery cash available, the council spent £43.5m on building the stadium, using some of the proceeds from the sale of Kingston Communications, Hull's white telephone box company, in 1999. At the time the club was plunging into one of its darkest episodes under the stewardship of its part-owner Stephen Hinchliffe, who in February 2001 was sentenced to five years in prison (reduced to four on appeal) for bribery and corruption relating to his collapsed company, Facia. City had famously been locked out of Boothferry Park after missing rent payments to the ground's owner, the tennis entrepreneur David Lloyd, who had sold the stadium to Hinchliffe's consortium. The club fell into administration.\nAdam Pearson, the former Leeds United commercial director, backed by a Leeds entrepreneur, Peter Wilkinson, bought the club, and the council then had sufficient confidence to furnish them with the stadium. Ashbee, signed by Jan Molby after six years at Cambridge United, recalls the move to the 25,586 all-seat stadium as \"a real step change\". Peter Taylor, who replaced Molby in October 2002, managed Hull teams to two promotions and into the Championship by 2006.\nThe 2008-10 stint in the Premier League under Phil Brown is best remembered for the 30-yard swerving strike that the Brazilian striker Geovanni scored in a 2-1 victory away at Arsenal, a memory that gives Hull fans hope for Wembley. City were relegated in 2010; the then owner, Russell Bartlett, had moved millions out of the club to finance his own company, and Allam says City were facing liquidation until he bought it and paid off a £17m tax bill.\nSince sacking their local hero Nick Barmby as manager and appointing Bruce in June 2012 City's hurtle upwards has cost £72m owed to Allam in loans, on which he charges 5% interest.\nThat money helped to finance Bruce's key signings last summer: Tom Huddlestone and Jake Livermore from Tottenham Hotspur and Curtis Davies from Birmingham City. Allam backed Bruce to spend £13m in January on the strikers Nikica Jelavic, from Everton, and Shane Long, from West Bromwich Albion, whose goals helped Hull stay in the Premier League. But both are Cup-tied and have sat out the triumphant march to Wembley.\nAllam, talking to the Guardian at his industrial generator factory last week, kept his pledge not to discuss his Hull Tigers name change plan, which he argues will be commercially advantageous, but which the FA has refused to sanction. \"Everybody is excited, we have made history,\" he said. \"After the end of the season then we talk about changing the name. That relates to the future.\"\nIan Waterson, a fan and spokesman for the City Till We Die campaign, which made a submission to the FA – arguing for the City name to be kept – is prepared to let sleeping dogs lie for the moment and is thrilled that the final has come around. \"There is still magic in the FA Cup,\" he said. \"We went through dark days years ago and we are grateful to the Allams. It is unbelievable that we are now in an FA Cup final.\"\nIf Bruce's team of assembled workers can beat Arsène Wenger's craftsmen at Wembley, if their name really is on the Cup, it will be engraved for always as Hull City, whatever happens next.\n"

        "text": "\nAllegations of cash payments to African presidents are to be investigated as part of the Serious Fraud Office inquiry into corruption at Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation, the FTSE-listed mining firm.\nThe financial watchdog last week launched a criminal investigation into ENRC, at the same time as the resignation of Mehmet Dalman, the chairman brought in to clean up the company, and the sacking of a legal firm which had spent more than two years looking into the miner's operations in Kazakhstan and Africa.\nIn an eight-page letter sent to ENRC following its sacking, seen by the Sunday Times, legal firm Dechert claims to have found \"documentary evidence regarding the making of cash payments to African presidents\" in connection with the purchase of a copper smelter in Zambia.\nWhile looking into the acquisition of a copper mine in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the firm also found \"evidence that documents had been falsified, the CFO of ENRC had been misled, and that $35m [£22.6m] had been misappropriated\".\nA spokeswoman for ENRC said: \"There is no evidence to substantiate these allegations.\"\nDechert has been served with a Section 2 notice, meaning documents gathered during its inquiry into ENRC's African operations must be handed over to SFO investigators. The firm has already handed over its report on the Kazakh operations, examining more the $100m of payments to offshore accounts held in the British Virgin Islands, Latvia and Hong Kong.\nIn 2012, ENRC's bill for external advisers including lawyers rose by $51m to $143m, including payments for advice on acquisitions. Dechert declined to comment.\nENRC originally appointed lawyers to conduct an independent investigation when a whistleblower made allegations against the company.\nIn a statement last week the SFO said: \"ENRC [has been accepted] for criminal investigation. The focus of the investigation will be fraud, bribery and corruption relating to the activities of the company or its subsidiaries in Kazakhstan and Africa.\"\nENRC said: \"ENRC confirms that it is assisting and co-operating fully with the SFO. ENRC is committed to a full and transparent investigation of its procedures and conduct.\"\nAlexander Machkevitch, one of three co-founders of ENRC who control the company, announced on 19 April that he was working with the Kazakh government and fellow shareholders Patokh Chodiev and Alijan Ibragimov on making an offer for the company. The three men control 44% of ENRC between them.\nThe company listed on the London Stock Exchange in 2006, hoping a combination of respectable British corporate governance and access to natural resources from far-flung regions would attract investors. In 2011 the former chairman, Sir Richard Sykes, and an independent director, Ken Olisa, were ousted in a boardroom coup backed by the founding directors. At the time Olisa described ENRC'S behaviour as \"more Soviet than City\".\nAs well as Dalman, recent resignations from ENRC include the company secretary, head of human resources and the chief commercial officer. Dieter Ameling and Sir Paul Judge have also announced that they will not be standing for re-election as directors at the group's annual meeting in June.\n"

        "text": "\nThe chief executive of GlaxoSmithKline has insisted the British drugs group had no knowledge of the alleged cash and sexual favours bribery scandal which has engulfed the company in China before the police arrested four of its senior Chinese executives last week.\nSir Andrew Witty, GSK's chief executive, said the company's headquarters had \"no sense\" of the \"shameful\" and \"deeply disappointing\" allegations that some GSK China executives are the \"godfathers\" of a criminal scam, bribing doctors with cash and sexual favours worth £320m.\nWitty, who was speaking publicly about the \"fraudulent behaviour\" for the first time, said: \"It appears that certain senior executives in the Chinese business have acted outside of our processes and our controls to both defraud the company and the Chinese healthcare system.\"\nHe said the company has \"zero tolerance\" for the alleged behaviour, which is \"totally contrary\" to GSK's values.\nHowever, he repeatedly refused to say if he would hand back some of his bonus this year if the company was found to have broken the law in China. He said the level of his bonus – which totalled £2.7m last year – is \"really a matter for the board\".\nWitty added that he was \"absolutely committed to rooting out corruption and we are absolutely committed to getting to the bottom of what has happened\".\nThe GSK boss, who was paid £3.9m last year, said he was \"absolutely willing and ready\" to go to China to head up the company's investigation. However, he is leaving the day-to-day handling of the crisis to Abbas Hussain, GSK's head of emerging markets, who flew out to China take control of the situation last week.\nHe refused to provide details of how the alleged fraud operated, but said the Chinese policeinvestigation is focused on the four Chinese nationals already detained by the police. He said they appear to have been \"potentially defrauding GSK and also at the same time allegedly doing some things in the market which are clearly inappropriate and illegal\".\nThe Chinese investigators have \"no allegations\" against Mark Reilly, the British head of GSK China, or Steve Nechelput, its finance director in the country, Witty said. He said Reilly, who has left China for the UK, and Nechelput, who the Chinese have banned from leaving the country, have been helping GSK with its investigation.\nWitty said GSK's head office in London had no knowledge of the alleged fraudulent activity until the Chinese police raid its offices in Shanghai earlier this month. \"As far as headquarters, we had no sense of this issue.\"\nThis is despite GSK declaring last month that a four-month internal investigation into allegations of bribery and corruption in China found \"no evidence of corruption or bribery in our China business\".\nWitty said the previous allegations raised by a whistleblower were \"quite different\" to the new charges. \"They are two completely different sets of issues: we fully investigated the first and of course this has now surfaced in the last couple of weeks,\" he said.\nGSK has already pumped in extra cash into its investigations team in China to help them to get to the bottom of the scandal, Witty said.\nDespite the apparent serious breach of compliance, Witty said GSK's controls and audit systems are \"extremely robust\", but promised the company would \"learn from this and make changes\".\nIt comes a year after Witty promised a company-wide overhaul to prevent a repeat of a scandal in which GSK staff tricked and bribed doctors into prescribing dangerous antidepressants to children in the US. \"We're determined this is never going to happen again,\" he said last summer after GSK paid a record $3bn (£1.9bn) fine to settle the claim.\nGSK has \"reached out\" to regulators in the UK and the US and has \"consulted with the UK government\" about the Chinese investigation.\nHe warned that the allegations are likely to have \"some impact\" on GSK's future performance in China, but said it was \"too early to quantify the extent\".\nGSK reported a 2% rise in second-quarter sales to £6.6bn. Its drug and vaccine sales in China rose 14% to £212m. China accounts for just over 3% of the company's global sales.\nChina indicated that its investigation into the \"rampant\" bribery scandal will be extended to other foreign and local drug companies. \"It will not be surprising if more pharmaceutical companies and hospitals, domestic or international, are to be involved in probes in the days to come,\" the Chinese state news agency said yesterday. \"Big international firms should shoulder [their] due responsibilities to bid farewell to malpractice, setting a good example and serving as a wake-up call for domestic pharmaceutical companies.\"\n"

        "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/03/jacob-zuma-pleasure-dome-south-africa-elections",
        "text": "\nNicholas Ngonyama gazes across the valley and his eye settles on a palatial cluster of sand-coloured buildings whose thatched roofs glow in the autumn sunshine. \"I'm not happy,\" mutters the homeless, jobless man. \"The country is not happy. Too much money was spent on one man's home. That money could have been spent improving the lives of the people. It feels like he is spitting in our face.\"\nPresident Jacob Zuma's personal Xanadu, complete with stately pleasure-dome, has imposed itself on the landscape of one of South Africa's poorest areas, Nkandla, in KwaZulu-Natal. It covers the equivalent of eight and a half football pitches and has swallowed 246m rand (£13.7m) of taxpayers' money. \"Nkandlagate\" has become the defining scandal of Zuma's five-year reign and left him fighting for his political life in this week's elections.\n\"Chances are slim that the majority of people here will vote for him,\" says Ngonyama, 46, whose children live with his parents since he lost his home to a fire in 2009. His home is a shack without water and he looks with disbelief on Zuma's folly. \"We don't have houses. We can't even begin to explain the reasoning behind the expenditure of such an amount of money for one man.\"\nThe Nkandla affair is seen by many as the ultimate symbol of an African National Congress that is rotten to the core. Abusing public funds to build private mansions was once the preserve of kleptocrats elsewhere in Africa, such as Mobutu Sese Seko in Congo or Jean-Bédel Bokassa in the Central African Republic. South Africa, under founding president Nelson Mandela, believed it was different.\nBut the spiralling costs at what was once billed as Zuma's Camp David prompted rival politicians to lay criminal charges and call for his impeachment. One commentator described it as \"worse than Watergate\". The president has repeatedly insisted that he paid for the buildings from his own pocket, but South Africa's public protector accused him of unethical conduct and told him to repay the costs of a swimming pool, amphitheatre, visitor centre, cattle enclosure and chicken coop, all built as part of a state-funded upgrade. So far there is no sign of him doing so.\nThe sprawling homestead is a jarring sight in one of the world's most unequal societies. It was described as \"opulence on a grand scale\" by the public protector, who remarked that it \"leaves one with the impression of excessive and unconscionable 'Rolls-Royce' security constituting an island in a sea of poverty and paucity of public infrastructure\".\nAllister Sparks, a columnist on Business Day, wrote: \"Nkandlagate is about personal greed and moral shamelessness. It is about looting public money so that one man and his family can live in extravagant opulence for the rest of their lives – amid some of his people's most abject poverty.\"\nIndeed, since I last visited this remote village five years ago on the eve of Zuma's election, precious little has changed: donkeys and cows graze by the roadside, boys in ragged T-shirts wield sticks, and modest mud-brick dot the hills. Precious little, that is, except the luxury residence with its helipad, bulletproof windows and three-metre-high military-grade security fence, which looked like a construction site in 2009 but is now fit for a king.\nBack then, Zuma was regarded with hope: an impoverished Zulu herd boy and former inmate of Robben Island, he had risen to become the most powerful man in Africa. Singing, dancing and showing the common touch, he appeared to be a breath of fresh air after the aloof, donnish, pipe-smoking Thabo Mbeki. To critics, the Nkandla estate therefore represents a betrayal of the people all the more painful as they contemplate how the millions could have been spent for general benefit.\nOf 114,416 people living in the area, about 40% are unemployed. Only 10,000 households have electricity, 7,000 have no access to piped water and 12,000 rely on pit toilets. On Friday, watched by guards in red T-shirts with rifles, residents gathered for a meeting in a white marquee on a hill overlooking Zuma's homestead.\nArthur Thamsanqa Ntuli, mayor of Nkandla, thought about 90% of those present were jobless. \"We also have a lot of people who do not get water,\" he said. \"Even when there are pipes, sometimes people go a month without water. And we still have large areas where there is no electricity. The people of Nkandla, 20 years after the beginning of democracy, are still left behind in terms of the provision of services required.\n\"Where there is any money available, I wish it could be used to provide water and electricity, improve education by building libraries and laboratories, provide orphans with bursaries and create job opportunities for Nkandla people.\"\nNtuli, a member of Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), said the ANC had lost a local byelection after the Nkandlagate scandal broke. \"The fact that his municipality is led by the IFP is evidence that the majority in Nkandla have decided to turn their backs on the president and the ANC. The way people vote in national elections is often different, but we hope the ANC won't get the same as in 2009.\"\nSome fear to speak out against Zuma in a province with a long history of violence; according to crime researcher David Bruce, there have been more than 100 assassinations here in the past decade. Sthandiwe Hlongwane, who lives a short walk from the estate, says: \"I cannot comment on the situation because that could be risky for me. It could put my life in danger.\n\"There are people supporting Julius Malema [leader of the Economic Freedom Fighters party] but they aren't coming out. They say the only way to do it is go to the polls. They are scared to come out in public.\"\nHlongwane was the beneficiary of a publicity stunt in January when Malema and his colleagues built her a house. Thirty ANC supporters were arrested after throwing stones and water bottles at their rivals when it was handed over. Although she still lacks running water and uses an outdoor toilet, she is grateful for the upgrade.\n\"It's made a big difference,\" says Hlongwane, 31, who has children aged five and seven. \"I used to live in a mud house. This has made it easy for me to live. I'll vote for Julius Malema. If you look after me, I'll have to look after you, and that's what Malema did.\"\nBut there are still plenty of yellow ANC T-shirts in evidence in Nkandla, and Zuma's face adorns countless lamp-posts. KwaZulu-Natal was the only province where the party's share of the vote increased in 2009 and, with the IFP a fading force, this stronghold could be decisive in pushing the ANC towards a two-thirds majority. Zuma, who won the last election just after more than 700 bribery and corruption charges were dropped against him, has shown his powers of survival.\nBut elsewhere, in urban centres and among the middle class, Nkandlagate follows him like a shadow. Dali Mpofu, a lawyer and lifelong ANC member who defected to the Economic Freedom Fighters, says: \"In all the rallies that we go to, I make a point of not always talking about Nkandla, but people almost force you to because it's a big issue for people on the ground.\n\"It's a simple issue of if one person can have a 250m rand house while they are living in the shack, obviously that can't be just a 'by the way' issue. The premier of Gauteng [province] this weekend said that they get asked this whenever they do their door-to-door campaigns, and I have no doubt that she's right about it.\"\nThe saga has also split the ANC. Some party stalwarts have even asked people to vote tactically against it, either by voting for a small party or spoiling their ballot. Addressing a room packed with mineworkers and the unemployed in Johannesburg last week, Ronnie Kasrils, a former intelligence minister, said: \"We are saying that what is more important than the party is the ideas of the party, and it's the ideas that we are defending.\n\"If the party forgets such ideas, then we will stand against that and we will stand with our people who are demanding what we have promised them all our lives – a better life. So after 20 years yes, of achievements, of a right to vote and so on, we cannot stand idly by when we see these crimes of corruption and murder.\"\nOn Sunday the 72-year-old Zuma will make his case in a speech at the ANC's final election rally, hoping to avoid a repeat of the unprecedented booing he received at the same stadium during Mandela's memorial service. While the party is assured of a fifth consecutive victory on Wednesday, if it polls less than 60% of the vote, senior ANC figures – who have spent much of the campaign finding ways to apologise – will probably be panicked into wielding the dagger against him.\nShould he fall, his likely successor is Cyril Ramaphosa, set to become deputy president after this week's election. Once a firebrand miners' leader, he went into business and was serving on the board of platinum producer Lonmin at the time of the police massacre of mineworkers at Marikana in 2012. Soon after he was criticised for bidding 19.5m rand for a prize buffalo and calf at a nearby auction.\nKasrils and old comrades who fear that the ANC's elite are losing their working-class credentials will have found little consolation last week when Ramaphosa addressed the media in an Edwardian-era mansion framed by Tuscan colonnades and Palladian windows, built to entertain the mining Randlords of Johannesburg.\n\"My great ambition is to be president of a golf club where I am playing,\" he teased. \"That is my greatest dream. I'd like to be president of that.\n\"I'd also like to be president of my fishing club. I go fishing, and there is a club that I belong to. I want to be president of that. That is the sum total of my ambitions, to be president of one of the two. No other ambition do I have.\"\n"

        "text": "\nWhy does Britain arm human rights abusers? On the face of it, this is a nonsensical question. The British state is a human rights abuser, from Iraq to Afghanistan. On a scale calibrated according to those atrocities, what do a few bits of kit to Iran matter? What ethical barrier should stop Britain sending crowd control ammunition to Saudi Arabia, or assault rifles to Bahrain? Yet this is to deflect an important political question.\nThe arms industry accounts for 1.2% of all exports and 0.2% of all jobs in the UK. Economically, it is negligible. And, were it not for high-pressure sales and marketing departments working in the British government on behalf of the industry, it would be even more puny. So what accounts for the extent of state efforts to find clients for the manufacturers of weapons? Why has the British government always found the means to subsidise important arms purchases, through export credits?\nHere, it is not sufficient to invoke commercial cynicism or corruption. To explain it, one must insist on the \"primacy of politics\". That is, arms flows are centrally about powerful states taking sides in global political struggles, whether they are open and violent as in Bahrain in 2011, or submerged as in Belarus today. The transfer of weapons is simply one particularly sharp and bloodied edge of the projection of imperial power.\nIn and of themselves, individual trades may be of limited significance. Some news stories have alighted on a few transfers of minor significance to Iran and Syria, which seem to be at odds with Britain's current foreign policy stance. Rather than sifting through the receipts for arms trades, like tea leaves, looking for patterns, it makes more sense to begin by asking what the geopolitical priorities of the producer states' are, and how arms sales contribute to realising them.\nThis is unhelpfully obscured by well-meaning moral condemnations of \"arming repressive regimes\". All regimes are repressive to some extent – that's what weapons are for. The question is what strategic alliances are being forged and sustained. Any British government these days will send a small mountain of arms to Saudi Arabia and Israel on a regular basis. Both of these are states which the British empire had a role in creating, and both represent long-term strategic commitments on the part of the UK. On the other hand, some arms flows reflect temporary tilts, tactical interventions. Examples include the increased flow of weapons to Bahrain two years ago, or – in the early 2000s – to Indonesia when it was suppressing the Acehnese rebellion.\nThis is not to deny that immediate economic considerations have a role. Once the British state has decided that its arms industry is an important lever, it becomes necessary to support its operation by seeking as many clients as possible. The arms selling wing of the UK Trade & Investment department employs 160 civil servants. More broadly, arms development and sales has had a peculiar, fluctuating combination of economic functions since the end of the second world war. It has enabled states with large military complexes to boost growth and employment through temporary military expenditures, and has given them a means through which to indirectly organise national economies.\nMoreover, the strategic pre-eminence of the arms industry for the British state – the existence of taxpayer-funded lobbying and marketing bodies within the state, dedicated to specifically supporting arms deals – makes it ripe for clientelism, bribery and corruption. According to the late Robin Cook, BAE Systems \"appeared to have the key to the garden door at Number 10\" under New Labour.\nHowever, the commercial considerations would be relatively insignificant, the corruption easily extirpated, were it not for the political role the arms trade fulfils. The old-fashioned word for it is imperialism.\n"

Meanwhile, those close to FTSE 250 miner Kazakhmys, which owns 26% of ENRC, insist that reports it has already fallen in behind its compatriots are premature.\nThe trouble is, many have heard such platitudes before and the market seems disinclined to believe them. ENRC shares, once worth £14.59 each, stand at 239.9p, 5% below the 260p-a-share offer. The City may be wrong, but it seems to be betting on a deadline extension and then for minority shareholders to get stuffed. Again.\nKing heads for the pavilion\nSir Mervyn King, the soon-to-be-former governor of the Bank of England, is a man who loves a sporting metaphor. So as the Bank's monetary policy committee reveals the decision from its June deliberations over interest rates and quantitative easing this week, which is King's last meeting, it is tempting to consider the spectacle as akin to the fifth Test from pretty much any England versus West Indies cricket series in the 1980s. We've all got to sit through it, and there may even be the odd enjoyable contribution, but it is totally meaningless in terms of the overall result.\nFirstly, it would seem odd for a radical change of tactics just before Mark Carney, Threadneedle Street's new Canadian skipper, strides to the crease next month.\nSecond, in the absence of any negative economic news since May's gathering, economists reckon the discussion will mirror recent months.\nThat debate has seen King outvoted on the past four occasions about introducing more QE to stimulate the UK economy, so this week's meeting provides his team with a final chance to ignore him. And for King to play and miss one more time.\nAnd so does Buckles\nHere is Nick Buckles, the former boss of accident-prone security group G4S, speaking about his aborted takeover tilt at rival ISS following the company's humbling annual general meeting last year: \"[Shareholders] didn't like the deal … These things take a little bit of time to heal. We're 70%-80% of the way there.\"\nAs was common with Buckles, the confidence merely pre-empted farce. A month later the healing process was reversed, as G4S messed up the Olympic Games contract and the armed forces were mobilised at short notice to come to the rescue. A profit warning earlier this year made it a hat-trick, and Buckles inevitably left the group on Friday.\nThe company now hopes his departure will allow the slapstick to be considered part of history, as the board faces shareholders once again this week to present its (very) fresh line-up. The new chief exec, Ashley Almanza, has been with the group for just a month, while incoming chief operating officer Eddie Aston has yet to arrive. That makes it appear as though new(ish) chairman John Connolly has been forced into a brutal conclusion: when it comes to healing shareholder wounds, people with zero experience of running this complex firm are preferable to the last lot.\n"

But it has refused to explain exactly what they did or how the alleged bribery worked, despite one of the detained executives admitting to the charges on Chinese state television.\nHow long have GSK China executives been allegedly breaking the law?\nGao said the police have evidence that bribery has been a \"core part\" of GSK China's business model since 2007.\nGSK said it was \"deeply concerned and disappointed\" by the allegations, but it has refused to say how long the alleged bribery has been going on.\nHow much did GSK pay out in bribes? Did this inflate the price of GSK's drugs to patients? \nGao claims GSK spent 3bn yuan (£320m) on bribes. GSK has refused to comment.\nOne of the arrested executives, Liang Hong, told Chinese state TV that it raised prices Chinese consumers pay for GSK's drugs by up to 30%.\nAbbas Hussain, the company's head of emerging markets who was dispatched to Shanghai to oversee the crisis, has promised it will cut the price of its drugs in China.\nWhen did GSK first become aware of these allegations and why did Witty not address accusations of wrongdoing in China earlier?\nThe Chinese authorities announced the charges and arrested the four GSK executives on 15 July – this was just a week after the company said a four-month internal investigation found \"no evidence of corruption or bribery in our China business\".\nThat internal investigation was prompted by a whistleblower who wrote to GSK's board this year alleging that Chinese sales staff had been engaged in the \"widespread bribery of doctors to prescribe drugs\".\nGSK's operations in China have long been plagued by allegations of bribery and corruption. Last year, GSK sacked 56 employees in China for violating its rules, out of a worldwide total of 312 dismissals.\nThe New York Times claims it has seen an internal audit showing GSK was warned about serious problems in its Chinese research and development facilities as early as November 2011. The report includes a claim that GSK failed to release the results of a drug trial on mice when it was already testing the drug on humans.\nHow far up the corporate food chain did the corruption reach?\nGSK has refused to say how many of its executives appear to have breached Chinese laws, or name any individuals it suspects. Sources close to the company suggest the allegations are restricted to the four Chinese executives detained by the police.\nHowever, the Chinese police are preventing GSK China's British finance director Steve Nechelput from leaving the country, and want Mark Reilly, the British boss of GSK China, to return to Shanghai.\nGSK has refused to comment on whether Nechelput or Reilly were involved or aware of the bribery allegations. The company has also refused to say if or when Reilly will return to China.\nWhat will Witty do to clean up GSK's Chinese operations?\nHussain said GSK is taking the charges \"extremely seriously\" and will take \"all necessary actions to … root out corruption wherever it exists\", but the company has not so far given any details of specific measures it will take.\nWhat information has GSK passed to the Serious Fraud Office? \nGSK said it is regularly briefing the SFO, but has not said what information it has passed on.\nCan Witty assure shareholders that staff in other countries are not bribing doctors? \nLast year GSK paid a $3bn (£1.9bn) fine in the US to settle claims that it tricked and bribed doctors into prescribing dangerous antidepressants to children. After the settlement Witty vowed that a company-wide overhaul would prevent a repeat of the scandal.\nFollow the Guardian's live blog of Witty's conference call with the media from noon on Wednesday at www.theguardian.com/business\n"

        "text": "\nIt's becoming increasingly hard to spot the corporate good guys.\nRolls-Royce, the company that gets more favourable name-checks from ministers than even John Lewis, on Thursday said it had passed information about bribery and corruption allegations among intermediaries to the Serious Fraud Office.\nYes, that's the same Rolls-Royce whose premises in Derby were used for a cabinet meeting last year in order to demonstrate the government's commitment to great British manufacturing virtues.\nThese are merely allegations and so this tale may go nowhere. On the other hand, the company's statement was necessarily blunt about possible outcomes. It said: \"These could include the prosecution of individuals and the company.\"\nThere may still be a temptation to think that tales of wrongdoing – if proved – by mere intermediaries in Indonesia, China and other unnamed countries could not do serious damage to the reputation of a company of Rolls-Royce's stature. Well, maybe.\nThe trouble is, intermediaries are appointed and approved by the company as sales and distribution agents and can manage the servicing of engines. There is an obligation on Rolls-Royce to appoint the right intermediaries and then monitor their behaviour.\nIt will be slightly more comforting for Rolls-Royce shareholders that the allegations relate to the \"past and distant past\", which seems to mean the 1980s and 1990s in the main.\nThat, presumably, is why the company was at pains to point out how it has strengthened its compliance procedures in recent years.\nThere is now an ethics code, a policy for intermediaries and a compliance unit. An independent review of procedures will now follow for good measure.\nFor all that, the risk to the company's reputation, and thus commercial clout, is clearly not negligible.\nThe stock market judged that 3% off Rolls-Royce's share price was about right while it awaits details and clarity.\nIn the meantime, though, don't expect to see more cabinet meetings in Derby.\n"

        "text": "\nThe first real cracks of strain at Rolls-Royce began to appear last week, five months after the company revealed it was co-operating with the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) over allegations of bribery and corruption.\nThe FTSE 100 engine maker announced the shock departure of Mark King, the head of its aerospace division and a man many analysts and insiders saw as a future chief executive. His resignation after four months in his current role, ending a 27-year career at the company, has inevitably reawakened interest in the SFO issue because it is scrutinising allegations that centre on the civil aerospace division.\nThere is no suggestion that King was complicit in any wrongdoing that is alleged to have taken place and Rolls-Royce declined to comment on whether his departure was related to the allegations, while the SFO has yet to confirm whether it will even launch an official investigation.\nNonetheless, the allegations are back in the headlines again. One of the many questions now is to what, if any, extent Rolls will be damaged by the process or the ultimate findings of an inquiry. For a company that has prided itself on an impeccable reputation and high-quality products, and never felt the need to promote itself to the wider world, the last few months must have been excruciating.\n\"It does have an impact because everything is about reputation,\" said one industry insider who did not want to be named. \"Reputation costs money. Rolls hasn't built that level of credibility overnight. You need to take all possible steps to protect it. If you don't take swift action, it will have an impact over the longer term.\"\nTo date, Rolls appears to have earned some credit by publicly revealing in early December that it had identified \"matters of concern\" and had passed information to the SFO.\nThe company also said at the time that it had begun its own investigation after the SFO requested information relating to contracts in China and Indonesia, and that it had subsequently identified issues in other markets.\nThe majority of the claims relate to the 1980s and 1990s. They include the allegation by a former employee turned whistleblower, Dick Taylor, that $20m (£13m) and a car was given to the son of Indonesia's former president to persuade the national airline, Garuda, to order Rolls-Royce Trent 700 engines.\nThe SFO has never commented on this matter, nor has it launched an official investigation, so the company has been proactive in bringing it to light. It has also sought to reassure investors that changes have been made to strengthen anti-corruption procedures, not least with the appointment of veteran lawyer and Conservative peer Lord Gold to lead a review.\n\"In terms of reassuring investors that they are on top of it and that this is not an endemic problem, I think they have done that,\" said Ed Stacey, an analyst at Espirito Santo. The shares have risen steadily since the revelations emerged back in December.\nThe company continues to win business, and said on Thursday that it expected modest growth in underlying revenue and good growth in underlying profit this year. For instance, at the end of 2012 Rolls's order book stood at £60.1bn, up 4%.\nStacey believes the inquiry is unlikely to put off customers: \"For airlines ordering engines, I don't think you're going to worry about opening yourself up to an investigation. It doesn't feel like that.\"\nRolls could face a substantial financial hit further down the line, however, if the SFO were to impose a fine.\nThere has been speculation recently that the company and the watchdog are working towards a civil settlement. Such an agreement might involve a multimillion-pound fine, but would avoid criminal charges. Rolls and the SFO have not commented on this.\nThe arrival on Thursday of new chairman Ian Davis – the former head of management consultant McKinsey and a non-executive director at BP – and a new chairman of Rolls's ethics board, show that the company is attempting to move on.\nDespite its strengths, however, there will be more uncomfortable moments and unwanted attention ahead for Rolls-Royce as the inquiry rumbles on. A return to the quiet life cannot be granted yet.\n"

        "text": "\nOver two days in June 2007, 13 obscure business men and women delighted in the luxury of Horsham's five star South Lodge hotel as they attended a corporate awayday.\nThe theme of the meeting was \"what it means to run a public listed company\" and a team of bankers, accountants and lawyers from Deutsche Bank, PricewaterhouseCoopers and Herbert Smith gave talks on topics such as \"overview of the UK anti-corruption legislation and how UK companies could be liable for corrupt acts overseas\".\nThe audience was, of course, the senior management of the soon to be floated mining group Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation (ENRC), a company that was to be catapulted straight into the FTSE 100 index when it floated on the London Stock Exchange in December of that year.\nSix years later, ENRC and its directors are no longer obscure: but for all the wrong reasons. Investors, who initially saw their ENRC shares soar, have watched as they have slumped by 80% from their peak, wrecked by a string of damaging corporate governance rows and corruption allegations that have eroded the miner's image.\nENRC was founded by three oligarchs – Alexander Machkevitch, Alijan Ibragimov and Patokh Chodiev – who held on to 44% of the company after the flotation. Kazakhmys, then another FTSE 100 company, owned 26% and the Kazakhstan government 12%, which, unusually, left a free float for other investors of less than 20%. But what all the shareholders own is a company with more than 70,000 employees – 65,000 of whom are located in Kazakhstan – who mine chromium, manganese, iron ore, bauxite and coal.\nThe significance of the control the central Asian shareholders wielded was soon to be illustrated. The first crisis erupted in June 2011, as a bitter boardroom battle boiled over and independent directors Sir Richard Sykes and Ken Olisa were ousted from the board.\nOlisa memorably described the company as \"more Soviet than City\" and by the end of that year it was clear that corporate governance was not going to be the only concern. It emerged that the Serious Fraud Office was gathering intelligence on allegations of fraud and the company was conducting an ongoing internal investigation into claims that tens of millions of pounds had gone missing from SSGPO, a subsidiary in Kazakhstan.\nBy February 2012, independent director Mehmet Dalman was promoted to become chairman and immediately staked his reputation on cleaning up the company, even though he had sat on the board since the 2007 float and had previously invested money on behalf of Ibragimov. However, despite the public proclamations of how he was going to solve the various crises, it did not quite work out like that. Dalman walked away last week after stating: \"I have achieved all that I can as chairman of ENRC.\"\nTwo days later, the SFO announced it was launching a criminal investigation into allegations of \"fraud, bribery and corruption relating to the activities of the company or its subsidiaries in Kazakhstan and Africa\". ENRC says it is \"assisting and cooperating fully with the SFO\" while being \"committed to a full and transparent investigation of its procedures and conduct\".\nSo what are the accusations? The ones that are known about are wide and varied. For example, a presentation given to the SFO last year by the ENRC's then law firm, Dechert, and seen by the Guardian, alleges that there had been more than \"$100m in fraudulent payments\" over four years.\nSpecifically, the document outlines allegations including the purchase of a farm in Kazakhstan by a director of SSGPO, where it states that the acquisition and running costs of the farm were \"paid from SSGPO funds\" and that the farm was owned via a \"nominee shareholding on behalf of SSGPO president and major shareholder, Alijan Ibragimov\". Representatives of Ibragimov have declined invitations to comment on these findings and it is not yet clear what, if any, action the SFO may take.\nFurthermore, when the company floated in 2007, its prospectus outlined areas of potential concern for future investors, including the existence of a complex structure called the Russian trading system (RTS) that involved sales made by ENRC to third parties and resulted in cash payments to ENRC's founders. The founders did not comment on RTS.\nMeanwhile, campaigners focus on the group's business in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), where ENRC acquired stakes in mining concessions from an Israeli tycoon, Dan Gertler, who appears to have a close relationship with DRC president Joseph Kabila. The deals were done at prices that seemed to deliver Gertler's offshore companies handsome – and speedy – profits, while campaigners also argue that ENRC's purchases were at levels significantly less than the true market value, meaning the company and its partner might have profited at the expense of one of the poorest populations on Earth. Both Gertler and ENRC have consistently denied any wrongdoing.\nWhile much of this has proved to be quite entertaining viewing for mining wonks who do not hold ENRC shares, the company is still largely held by the founders and the Kazakh government: so does it really matter to the City?\nMany feel it matters hugely. The reputation of London as a financial centre providing investors with world class standards of corporate governance has clearly been knocked. Meanwhile, investors in tracker funds – reckoned to own about 8% of the market – have suffered. Many of them are pension funds.\nThat, to borrow the phrase from the 2007 Sussex meeting, is what it actually means to run a public company.\n"

        "text": "\nThe trio of oligarchs behind Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation (ENRC) – the FTSE 100 miner being investigated by the Serious Fraud Office – have been hit by a fraud and bribery lawsuit against a separate part of their empire.\nThe Guardian has established that claims lodged in the Dutch courts show that International Mineral Resources (IMR) – which is wholly owned by the ENRC trio of Alexander Machkevitch, Patokh Chodiev and Alijan Ibragimov – is accused of \"blatant fraud, exacerbated by bribery\" by Russian fertiliser group EuroChem.\nEuroChem had previously said it was claiming damages of $800m (£500m) from its supplier Shaft Sinkers, which is 48% owned by IMR, following problems with a $2bn Russian potash mining project.\nIn the new case, the fertiliser group alleges that an IMR executive bribed a EuroChem employee with hundreds of thousands of roubles to cover up the alleged ineffectiveness of Shaft Sinkers' work. It also claims IMR facilitated the concealment of a report that questioned whether Shaft Sinkers's sealing technology could be effective on the potash project.\nEuroChem, which is owned by the Russian billionaire Andrey Melnichenko, is again seeking $800m in damages – but this time from IMR – having made a similar-sized claim in October in separate arbitration proceedings against Shaft Sinkers.\nIMR says its defence to the Dutch case will state that the EuroChem employee had signed a formal consultancy agreement with Shaft Sinkers to help it promote its business, which he had cleared with his immediate superior. They will also argue the alleged briber was only a consultant to IMR, not an employee. An IMR spokesman added: \"The suggestion that IMR was somehow involved in the legitimate arrangement between Shaft Sinkers and a EuroChem employee is a fabrication.\"\nIMR says no payments were made by itas part of this process or at all, and also that Shaft Sinkers has at all times been run as a separate entity with separate corporate governance. It says any payments that might have made under any consultancy agreement between Shaft Sinkers and the Russian company would have been entirely legitimate and proper.\nShaft Sinkers, which terminated the contract to prevent flooding of a 1,000 metre mining shaft, has filed counterclaims in its separate cases with EuroChem for $15m of fees it says it is still owed.\nA spokeswoman for Shaft Sinkers added: \"Shaft Sinkers understands that EuroChem has issued proceedings against IMR in the Dutch courts and that IMR has instructed lawyers and intends to vigorously defend such proceedings.\n\"The three arbitrations [two in Zurich, one in Paris] between EuroChem and Shaft Sinkers and the claims brought by Shaft Sinkers in all three arbitrations are subject to confidentiality and we therefore cannot comment on these cases other than to reiterate that we believe EuroChem's claims are without merit and we are defending these claims and pushing our claims vigorously.\n\" Likewise we believe the claim brought against IMR is without merit. The original contract was awarded to Shaft Sinkers in 2008 and was terminated by Shaft Sinkers in 2012\"\nIn 2010 Shaft Sinkers floated on the London Stock Exchange but, after initially performing well, the shares have now lost about 70% of their value, and slumped by about a third last October on news of the EuroChem dispute.\nOn Monday, Shaft Sinkers's annual results statement noted that last year's 15% drop in revenues to £192.5m was partly attributable to the termination of the project with EuroChem.\nThe oligarchs behind IMR also own 44% of ENRC, which faces an SFO inquiry into allegations of \"fraud, bribery and corruption relating to the activities of the company or its subsidiaries in Kazakhstan and Africa\". The move followed an internal ENRC investigation into string of corruption allegations, frequent corporate governance rows and a procession of high profile departures from the mining company.\nENRC has confirmed it is assisting and co-operating fully with the SFO. It said: \"ENRC is committed to a full and transparent investigation of its procedures and conduct\".\nMeanwhile the ENRC founding trio also said last month that they are considering taking ENRC private once more.\n"

        "text": "\nEthical business practices are a critical aspect of sustainability, yet progress towards eliminating bribery and corruption appears to be elusive in the face of persistent headlines such as the recent forced resignation of Avon CEO Andrea Jung, the IKEA incident in Russia and the conviction of former French president Jacques Chirac.\nCorruption continues to have a dire effect on the global economy. In fact, The World Bank and the World Economic Forum estimate that corruption costs more than 5% of global GDP ($2.6tn) annually, and estimate that more than $1tn is paid in bribes annually. These organisations suggest that corruption adds 10% to the total cost of doing business globally, and a staggering 25% to the cost of procurement contracts in developing countries.\nWhy should companies care? Firstly, corruption is illegal. Secondly, it distorts competition and free markets. And third: it incentivises and rewards unethical behaviour. The bottom line is that corruption hinders social and economic growth, delays the emergence of developing economies and stunts thriving democracies based on good governance and the rule of law.\nUnlike other white-collar crimes such as fraud, serious international efforts to combat corruption are almost nascent by comparison. Today, there is a UN Convention Against Corruption, the OECD Bribery Convention, and businesses may also participate in voluntary initiatives, such as the UN Global Compact and the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative.\nNational legislation such as the 1998 US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and the 2010 UK Bribery Act, seek to punish corruption regardless of where it occurs in the world. FCPA enforcement is a high priority for the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), with 12 cases prosecuted in 2011 and 16 cases in 2010. Companies including Alcoa, Daimler AG and Siemens AG have been charged under FCPA with Siemens, for one, obliged to pay a record $1.6bn in fines. The new UK law is expected to provoke similar prosecutions, high-profile convictions, costly fines and lawsuits.\nIt is not enough, however, to view bribery and corruption as a simple regulatory or compliance issue. A corporate culture that appears to tolerate or even reward maverick behaviour or rule-breaking is vulnerable to corruption. Accusations of bribery or corruption can destroy a company's good reputation and take years to repair, while fines and lawsuits can severely damage a company's social licence to operate.\nOn the other hand, an effective \"no bribes\" policy and a culture where strong business values and ethical behaviour are central facets, potentially offers the competitive advantages of transparency: a cleaner corporate image, more trustworthy business relationships, lower costs and less litigious shareholders.\nUnfortunately, having a corporate code of conduct or ethics is not a panacea – especially in the absence of globally accepted ethical norms. Corporate policies must be values-based but driven by strong leadership, clear governance structures, best practice benchmarking, specialised due diligence, training, monitoring and review mechanisms and effective channels for whistleblowers.\nCorruption, in all its forms, is always a business risk. Some operating environments clearly pose higher risks than others, such as jurisdictions with weak governance or lack of rule of law, resource-rich or in rapid growth economies, or where transactions involve middlemen or state monopolies.\nAddressing the challenges of combating bribery and corruption need not be overwhelming. In fact, it offers a major opportunity for companies to boost their own sustainability and resilience to shocks.\nDoug Bannerman is vice-president, Two Tomorrows (North America) and David Roberts is associate, Two Tomorrows (Europe).\nThis content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

        "text": "\nThe credibility of the Fifa president Sepp Blatter's much trumpeted \"road map to reform\" has been dealt a further blow after a prominent international anti-bribery expert resigned in frustration from the independent panel supposed to be overseeing it.\nAlexandra Wrage, who has previously criticised Fifa for \"neutering\" proposals made by the independent governance committee chaired by the Swiss law professor Mark Pieth, said that world football's governing body had proved resistant to change.\n\"We all focus our efforts where we can have an impact and I was not having an impact at Fifa,\" she told the Guardian. \"It is important the organisation you are dealing with is receptive to those efforts and receptive to change. The independent governance committee put in a tremendous amount of work and effort putting together some fairly uncontroversial recommendations which were then knocked back,\" said Wrage, who is president of the non-profit international anti-bribery group Trace.\nAmong the changes recommended by the panel were independent members of the Fifa executive committee, external vetting for ex-co members, and transparency on how much the president Blatter and other key executives are paid.\nBlatter bowed to calls for a wholesale reform of Fifa's governance in the wake of the chaotic 2018 and 2022 World Cup bidding process and a presidential election that was mired in allegations of bribery and corruption.\nThe fallout among former members of Fifa's executive committee continues to reverberate, with Jack Warner standing down on Sunday as government minister for security in Trinidad and Tobago in the wake of a damning Concacaf report into his tenure as president of the governing body for football in the US and central America. He followed that up on Monday by resigning as chairman of the United National Congress party.\nAt Fifa's forthcoming congress in Mauritius in May, Blatter has promised that its member countries will vote on a slate of measures including age and term limits for presidential office and membership of the executive committee. However, the precise wording and format of the proposals has yet to be made public.\n\"The [advisory panel] made recommendations that ultimately amounted to nothing more than commonsense textbook corporate governance and best practices in compliance, but even those were never considered by Fifa,\" Wrage's group added in its statement on her behalf.\nAfter Pieth was appointed to chair the panel, the non-profit group Transparency International also withdrew its co-operation from the reform programme after it emerged he would be paid by Fifa and it would not investigate historical allegations.\nPieth, who has also cut an increasingly frustrated figure in the face of the slow pace of reform, said Wrage had resigned because the panel wanted to carry on its work beyond the 2013 congress and she did not feel able to devote enough time to it.\nSubsequently, the investigatory chamber of Fifa's ethics committee has said it will examine the allegations surrounding the award of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups after all. Later this week Fifa is also expected to finally release its 4,000-page report into the bribery scandal surrounding former marketing agency ISL.\nA Swiss prosecutor said in a legal document released last year that Blatter's predecessor, João Havelange, and the former Fifa executive committee member Ricardo Teixeira took multimillion-dollar bribes on World Cup deals in the 1990s from the now defunct rights agency which went bust in 2001. Teixeira paid a fine of SF2.5m (£1.75m) and Havelange one of SF0.5m (£350,000).\nA file prepared by the Fifa ethics investigator Michael Garcia was passed to Hans-Joachim Eckert, the governing body's ethics judge, several weeks ago. It is expected to be published this week.\nWarner quit Fifa's executive committee in 2011 amid claims he had helped facilitate the paying of bribes to members of the Caribbean Football Union as part of Mohamed bin Hammam's bid to unseat Blatter. He resigned before the investigation was completed and the file was closed.\nBut investigators at Concacaf have now accused Warner of embezzlement in a report that also implicated his former Fifa executive committee colleague Chuck Blazer. They are accused of failing to disclose that a $25.9m (£17m) centre of excellence was built on Warner's land and that Blazer received $20m from Concacaf.\nThe report also found that Blazer, Concacaf's former general secretary, had taken $15m in commissions from 1998 onwards without any agreement on those payments in place.\nThe audit found Blazer had used the organisation's funds to \"finance his personal lifestyle\", including purchasing plush apartments in Miami's South Beach and attempting to do the same in the Bahamas while failing to produce tax returns.\nIt emerged last month that the FBI were looking into the affairs of Blazer and Warner, who have both denied any wrongdoing.\n"

        "text": "\nThe City watchdog has warned that many banks are failing to provide proper controls to prevent bribery and corruption despite the high profile introduction of the Bribery Act last year.\nThe Financial Services Authority said almost half of the 15 banks it visited for spot inspections failed to provide an \"adequate anti-bribery and corruption risk assessment\". It said it was considering referring some for further investigation and possible fines.\nThe FSA warned that senior managers' knowledge of corruption laws was so poor that it was \"difficult for us to see how firms' senior management could provide effective oversight\". Only two of the firms visited, it added, had carried out an anti-corruption audit.\n\"Overall, despite the high profile of the issue, the investment banking sector has been too slow and too reactive in managing bribery and corruption risks,\" said Tracey McDermott, the FSA's acting director of enforcement and financial crime. \"Firms across all sectors must have appropriate controls to manage their financial crime risks, whether related to bribery and corruption or otherwise.\"\nMcDermott said the FSA, and the newly formed Financial Conduct Authority that will take on responsibility for financial wrongdoing from next year, will continue to monitor banks' progress closely and will consider issuing fines.\nThe warning comes hot on the heels of an £8.75m fine handed down to Coutts, the banker to the Queen owned by RBS, for breaches of money-laundering rules after three years of \"serious\" and \"systemic\" problems in handling the affairs of customers vulnerable to corruption because of their political links.\nThe FSA's latest investigation examined the banks' rules and procedures to limit gifts and hospitality and check the background of future employees and remuneration structures. It found that investment banks generally limited hospitality to £400 for individuals and to £15,000 for corporate or sponsorship events. The report found that one banker had accepted corporate hospitality of \"a three-day trip to the football World Cup in South Africa costing £10,000 for one employee and his wife\".\nNo individual banks were named in the report.\nThe introduction of the Bribery Act last year was the most significant overhaul of the UK's bribery laws for 100 years, placing legal responsibility on firms for ensuring that anti-corruption measures are enforced.\nGreg Brandman, a former manager in the FSA enforcement division and now a partner at law firm Eversheds, said: \"There has been concern within the FSA for some time about the financial crime risk inherent in many banks' business models and we can expect to see FSA enforcement action in this area in the not too distant future. The message from this latest thematic review is particularly clear: if financial institutions have not carried out an adequate anti-bribery and corruption risk assessment and made appropriate enhancements to their systems and controls, they had better get on with it, or they may not have a leg to stand on when the regulator comes knocking.\"\n"

Other members of staff have received similar communications from Mr Chapman which have been forwarded to the BBC,\" Harlequin said.\n\"Panorama made no attempt to contact Harlequin prior to making serious (yet entirely false) allegations to others about Harlequin's alleged conduct and failed to provide any evidence to support these allegations.\"\nHarlequin added that it appreciated the BBC's swift reaction to its the complaint and launching an investigation.\nThe company also published the email it alleges that Chapman sent to Ghent, who is described in an email reply as \"global head of security and risk\", on 13 March and includes what it claims is \"an attempted bribe\".\nChapman admits in the email, according to Harlequin, that he is being \"a bit cheeky here\", before suggesting to Ghent that the company may soon be unable to pay its staff and he may be able to get security work at the BBC. The BBC man then asks Ghent if he can help out with information.\n\"It's unlikely that [Harlequin chairman David] Ames and maybe Harlequin will be around for much longer, nor will he have the money to pay people for much longer,\" Chapman is alleged to have said in the email.\n\"There are a long list of creditors already I understand.

Harlequin is suing O'Halloran for alleged fraudulent misappropriation and has a separate libel action against Newman, who left Wilkins Kennedy in 2012.\nThe BBC said on Thursday following the Harlequin statement that it had nothing to add to its initial comment issued late on Wednesday: \"In light of information received late in the production process of this film the BBC decided to postpone broadcast.

        "text": "\nRolls-Royce is being investigated by the Serious Fraud Office over allegations that include the payment of a $20m (£12.5m) bribe to the son of a former Indonesian president, who then secured an aircraft engine order for the manufacturer.\nSeveral allegations of malpractice involving the Derby-based company in Indonesia, China and other countries are being probed by the SFO. The most serious charge so far was levelled by a former Rolls-Royce employee, Dick Taylor, who claimed that Tommy Suharto – a son of the late President Suharto – received $20m and a Rolls-Royce car to persuade the national airline, Garuda, to order Rolls-Royce Trent 700 engines in 1990. Rolls-Royce declined to comment.\nTaylor's allegations have been widely disseminated online, largely through their attachment to comments beneath Rolls-Royce news stories.\nRolls-Royce admitted last week that the SFO had approached the company over allegations of bribery and corruption in Indonesia and China, prompting the firm – the world's second largest aircraft engine maker – to hire US law firm Debevoise & Plimpton to investigate.\nRolls-Royce indicated in its statement that the allegations unearthed by the firm's probe went beyond Indonesia and China, saying that the legal investigation had found \"matters of concern\" in the countries flagged by the SFO but also in other unspecified markets. The company said the concerns related to the use of \"intermediaries\" in those markets.\n\"The consequence of these disclosures will be decided by the regulatory authorities. It is too early to predict the outcomes, but these could include the prosecution of individuals and of the company. We will co-operate fully,\" said Rolls-Royce last week.\nThe SFO has yet to confirm whether it has launched a formal investigation, but legal experts say the SFO's new director, David Green, has signalled an end to a perceived trend that the SFO has recently preferred settlements to prosecutions in recent times.\nRolls-Royce emphasised how seriously it was treating the allegations last week, announcing plans to appoint an \"independent senior figure\" to review its compliance regime and report to the board's ethics committee.\nRolls-Royce's chief executive, John Rishton, added that the company would not tolerate \"improper business conduct of any sort\".\nThe allegations could lead to multi-million pound fines on both sides of the Atlantic after Rolls-Royce confirmed that the US department of justice had been made aware of the company's findings. The DoJ has shown an active interest in pursuing bribery allegations recently, with Avon and News Corporation among the companies placed under scrutiny.\nThe DoJ's most high profile case involving a UK company of recent times saw BAE Systems, the defence contractor, pay $400m to settle corporate bribery charges after pleading guilty to making false statements to the US authorities.\nIt is understood that the allegations passed by Rolls-Royce to the SFO related to the \"past and distant past\", starting in the 1980s and 1990s, although some of the concerns discovered by the company arose after 2000.\nTimings are important because Rolls-Royce cannot be prosecuted under the Bribery Act – a tough new law – for offences that occurred before July 2011. Rolls-Royce therefore faces the threat of prosecutions under the Theft Act or for conspiracy to defraud, according to legal experts.\n"

        "text": "\nRolls-Royce faces the threat of a multimillion pound fine on both sides of the Atlantic after the industrial group revealed that concerns about bribery and corruption have been flagged to Britain's Serious Fraud Office and the US Department of Justice.\nThe world's second largest aircraft engine manufacturer said the SFO had approached the business over allegations of malpractice in Indonesia and China. A subsequent Rolls-Royce investigation, carried out by a law firm, found \"matters of concern\" in those countries and other unspecified markets. The company said the findings had been passed to the SFO and involved \"intermediaries\" in those markets.\n\"The consequence of these disclosures will be decided by the regulatory authorities. It is too early to predict the outcomes, but these could include the prosecution of individuals and of the company. We will co-operate fully,\" said Rolls-Royce. The SFO declined to comment, but it is understood that the organisation has yet to launch a formal investigation.\nSources familiar with the allegations said the main concerns arose in the \"past and distant past\", with the most dated issues relating to events in the 1980s and 1990s. However, some allegations relate to incidents that occurred after 2000. It is understood that the Rolls-Royce investigation has also scrutinised an allegation that a well-connected individual in Indonesia was paid $20m to supply Rolls-Royce aircraft engines to a carrier. Another allegation suggests a second individual was paid $1m a year.\nRolls-Royce said it had \"significantly strengthened\" its compliance procedures in recent years, including the establishment of a new ethics code, but took a further step on Thursday with the announcement that it will appoint an \"independent senior figure\" to review its compliance regime and report to the board's ethics committee.\nRolls-Royce's chief executive, John Rishton, said in a strident statement that the company would not tolerate \"improper business conduct of any sort.\" He added: \"This is a company with exceptional prospects and I will not accept any behaviour that undermines its future success\". Shares in Rolls-Royce fell 3% to 885p, valuing the company at £17.1bn.\nTony Woodcock, head of regulatory litigation at Stephenson Harwood, a law firm, said co-operating with the SFO investigation will not spare Rolls-Royce from prosecution. The SFO's new boss, David Green, has indicated that the organisation will tackle a perception that it is more amenable to settlements than prosecutions.\n\"The current policy of the SFO is that a company cannot avoid prosecution simply by raising a flag and conducting an internal investigation. There has been a significant change of emphasis from the previous Director's stance on this. Nonetheless, it will mitigate a company's position on sentencing,\" said Woodcock.\nThe DoJ has been informed of the investigations but declined to comment further. The investigation of bribery charges has become a major priority for US authorities, particularly of US companies charged with bribing overseas officials. Companies including Avon and News Corp are currently under scrutiny. But the US authorities have also rigorously pursued foreign firms alleged to have bribed officials. In 2010 UK defence giant BAE Systems paid $400m (£249m) to settle corporate bribery charges after pleading guilty to making false statements to the US authorities. At the same time BAE Systems paid a £30m fine in a settlement with the SFO after admitting to a book-keeping misdemeanour over the sale of an air traffic control system to Tanzania.\n"

UKEF, which has been dubbed the \"department for dodgy deals\" by the Jubilee Debt Campaign, is designed to help British companies obtain insurance and credit to help them export goods overseas when traditional lenders may be afraid to provide financing.\nLisa Nandy, the Labour MP for Wigan and chair of the inquiry, said: \"Trade should never come at the expense of fundamental human rights and the department must take this more seriously than it has in the past.\"\nMartin Horwood, the Liberal Democrat MP for Cheltenham and a member of the APPG, said the inquiry had revealed that banks often had much stricter environmental and human rights standards than the government. He said that if UKEF did not raise its standards \"the taxpayer could end up funding business even the private sector cannot on moral grounds\".\nAmong the catalogue of ethically questionable deals approved by UKEF, which was formerly known as the Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD), are £35m lent to Zimbabwe to buy five Hawk fighter jets from BAE Systems between 1989 and 1992.\nZimbabwe, which was already heavily indebted at the time of the loans, spent £49m repaying the cost of the Hawks. Mugabe's government deployed the jets in the 1998-2002 war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Africa's most deadly conflict in modern history, which led to 5.4 million deaths.\nThe ECGD also supported the notorious al-Yamamah \"oil for arms\" deal with Saudi Arabia, for which BAE Systems was investigated by the Serious Fraud Office amid allegations of bribery and corruption. The inquiry was eventually dropped following the intervention of the then prime minister, Tony Blair.\nAs well as arms, the department has provided funds for the world's largest and riskiest oil-drilling project, in the Atlantic Ocean, and a 1,090-mile (1,760km) BP joint venture oil pipeline through the Caucasus.\n"

        "text": "\nCorruption is rife and getting worse in high-growth export markets promoted by the Foreign Office and Downing Street, according to a leading academic who advises corporations on leadership and ethical business practices.\nIn the Bric countries – Brazil, Russia, India and China – and beyond to Mexico, South Africa and Indonesia, the demand for backhanders and financial favours is on the rise, says Andrew Kakabadse, a professor of international management development at Cranfield University. In eastern Europe, the situation has deteriorated since the financial crash, with corrupt contracts for new roads and infrastructure projects a feature of the former communist bloc states.\n\"In two-thirds of the world, one can't do business unless a bribe is given. From Russia to China to Turkey and Greece and most of South America, to many Asian countries, some transactional cost may be incurred – it is called bribery in the west, in other countries it is called a transactional cost,\" says Kakabadse.\nAccording to the academic, about 80% of deals outside Europe and the US are marred by attempts to extract bribes or kickbacks that costs billions of pounds. Ruling elites, middlemen and civil servants routinely demand cash and favours before allowing contracts to be signed. Sometimes they refuse to pay companies for goods and services, knowing local courts will dismiss applications from foreign-owned firms for compensation. Few cases come to court.\nBritain is keen to venture into new markets as part of what the chancellor, George Osborne, terms \"the march of the makers\", but Kakabadse's comments indicate that encounters with corruption could be one consequence of broaching some territories.\nUkraine's president, Viktor Yanukovych, has conceded that his country is in the grip of a corruption epidemic. He says a crackdown on kickbacks to public officials is under way, though his critics allege he has presided over a sharp rise in corrupt practices since taking office. Elsewhere in eastern Europe, Hungary has failed to shake off bad habits and ranks alongside Romania, Bulgaria and the Balkan countries among states where corruption is rife.\nMultinationals are also becoming embroiled in graft cases. Last week Siemens paid €330m (£261.4m) to the Greek government to settle a long-running bribery case. Greece had claimed that bribes paid by the company from the late 1990s to 2007 cost taxpayers €2bn in overpriced hospital buildings and defence contracts. Greek officials who brokered the contracts gained millions of euros in kickbacks, and an investigation named 15 Greek politicians as also benefiting.\nWalmart, the US retailer, is examining a report alleging that it bribed hundreds of Mexican public servants to win planning permission to open stores. Documents are believed to show senior executives sanctioned the payments. Nonetheless, Transparency International, which ranks countries by their levels of corruption, says the situation is improving after several years of campaigning against corrupt practices.\nFew UK businesses will discuss brushes with corruption. This can include their exports being ensnared by corrupt port authority workers, local government staff and planning officers who impound goods and refuse to validate contracts, and high-ranking government officials demanding a slice of foreign company revenues. The engineering firm Mott MacDonald is one of the few to discuss the issue openly, citing corruption as a problem in several countries where it operates.\nRichard Williams, Mott MacDonald's boss, says many countries are \"ethically challenged\" and managers need to be aware of the demands for kickbacks. The CBI, the UK business lobbying group, echoes the Foreign Office in giving firms a straightforward message: comply with the Bribery Act, which came into effect last year. The act outlaws bribery by UK companies and their local partners. Facilitiation payments, which are bribes to get planning documents processed or the electricity in a local office switched on, are banned, as are favours to protect existing contracts or win business.\nWilliams argues that it would be wrong to characterise Europe as a haven of clean business dealings. He says he wants to warn UK firms that they must be wary of jumping into new export markets blind to the potential for corrupt practices. In central Europe, which is still throwing off some of the worst practices of the communist era, poverty wages for civil servants encourage corrupt practices.\n\"It is generally state organisations that put a lake of treacle in front of you that must be crossed to win a contract. And even when you win, there is the possibility you have become a victim of something – a corrupt practice – that is going on without your knowledge,\" Williams says. \"In some countries we have restricted ourselves to working with the private sector.\"\nA recent report by the international anti-poverty charity Tax Justice Network found that efforts by global institutions to tackle bribery and corruption had failed, despite a raft of new laws and guidelines ostensibly barring businesses and public institutions from turning a blind eye. It said a crackdown by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, which polices anti-corruption rules put in place by nation states, was \"deeply flawed\" because it failed to look in detail at the role played by tax havens. Much of the cash paid in cases of bribery and corruption makes its way to tax havens to avoid local tax inspectors and bypass the police and officials entrusted with tackling corruption.\n"

You knew in your bones what you wanted: you wanted to shine light into the dark corners of government and society. You wanted to turn impunity into accountability. You wanted to speak truth to power.\nSo you went to journalism school, and it was good. You got to use those skinny reporter's notebooks, which you used to cover the de-chartering of Kappa Sigma for its \"statutory rape social\" and the lawsuit by the Hmong Students Association to have a Hmong studies department set up. \nAlso, you pulled out your pad in bars to interview hot women. \n\"J school\" prepared you well. After four short years, you were ready to leave the womb of undergraduate studies to take on the rough-and-tumble world of graduate studies. At the age of 24, you were released into general society as professional reporter, in central Pennsylvania, covering the solid waste authority, the county fair and live births at Community Hospital. There, you broke the first-baby-of-1982 story.\nYour career progressed, from a 20,000-circulation suburban weekly to a 45,000 small-city daily, where you won a reporting prize after recognizing the state insurance commissioner in a strip bar. This was big news because she was dancing there.\nYou parleyed that into a job at a major metropolitan daily, where you were part of a Pulitzer Prize-winning team that uncovered widespread bribery and corruption in the city licensing bureau. This was in 1995. In 1996, you were hired on the metropolitan desk of the New York Times. This job mainly involved going to murder scenes and fires in the outer boroughs. \nBut you noticed a pattern of arrests – or, actually, non-arrests – in homicide cases involving minority victims, particularly immigrants. For this, in the year 2000, you received your second Pulitzer Prize. You were immediately promoted to the national desk, where you covered civil rights for five years. This got you a foreign desk posting. London! Mumbai! Seoul! \nThen, last week, they laid off your sorry ass. You are fictional, of course, but not by much.\nNo problem, you are an A-list journalist with two Pulitzers. All you have to do is sit by the phone until Time Magazine and the Washington Post and Newsweek and Newsday, or at least the Kansas City Star, give you a call. And perhaps they will – as soon as they get finished laying off their own staff. Which will not happen until the last editorial employee turns off the lights for good.\nTrrrrrrrinnnng. Al-Jazeera calls.\nYes, calling you. You are being offered a job funded by the Emir of Qatar, a petro-rich sheik.\nAl-Jazeera is one of the most significant news organizations of the past 20 years, covering the Arab world with a degree of depth and scope unprecedented in the region, where otherwise redlines abound for national media in every country. It does a pretty good job covering the rest of the world, too. But to repeat, it is bankrolled by petro-royalty in a country that is nobody's idea of a liberal democracy. \nVigorous reporting on revolutions in Egypt, Syria and Tunisia somehow has not been matched when the dissidence occurs in Gulf neighbors Saudi Arabia and Bahrain. And then, there is the inflammatory anti-western and anti-Israeli rhetoric give so much oxygen on its broadcasts. Perhaps not on al-Jazeera English, which is recruiting you, but didn't Dave Marash quit that channel because the editorial agenda kept poking him in the ribs? And didn't you once turn down a job at the Christian Science Monitor because you didn't want to explain Mary Baker Eddy?\nWill it be easier to take your paycheck from an emirate whose economy functions based on indentured servitude?\nBut will CBS call? Will NBC call? Will ABC call? Will CNN call? Nah, they're all trimming staff, too. The only other news organization on the grow is Bloomberg. Has Bloomberg called?\nNo, Bloomberg has not called. Poet Mohammed al-Ajami is rotting in prison for life on the charge of insulting the emir, but, once again, Bloomberg has not called. This is a conundrum, is it not?\nBut wait. There's this: al-Jazeera English has never had much distribution in the US because cable operators wouldn't pick up the channel. The market penetration was so bad that the emir just shelled out $1bn to Al Gore and friends to buy their Current channel, which was available in 40 million homes.\nThe thing is, nobody, but nobody, watched that channel. That's the beauty part. You don't have to explain away your employer, if nobody ever sees your reporting.\nSo it's settled. You tell friends that this is the channel that brought down tyrants. You tell your family that the health insurance is fantastic.\n"

        "text": "\nBritain's Department for International Development (DfID) on Friday published for the first time plans to tackle the threat of \"endemic corruption\" in 29 priority countries, including Pakistan, Somalia and Nepal.\nDfID also announced funding for anti-corruption units of the Metropolitan police (£3.4m) and the City of London police (£3.8m). The Met's corruption unit was involved in the investigation and prosecution of James Ibori, the former governor of Delta state in Nigeria, who was sentenced to 13 years in jail after admitting fraud of nearly £50m.\nWithout DfID funding, the Met unit would have closed down by April, a DfID official said. The units were set up because there were no teams in the UK dedicated to tackling corruption in other countries.\nDfID's moves came as David Cameron, who is in Liberia for talks on the development agenda for when the millennium development goals expire in 2015, cited corruption as one of the factors that kept countries poor.\n\"Liberia is a country that was absolutely devastated by conflict and civil war. It is now recovering but there is still desperate poverty. I think it is very important we keep a focus on eradicating extreme poverty … But I also think it is important we look at those things that keep countries poor. Conflict, corruption, lack of justice, lack of the rule of law. These things matter as well as money.\"\nCameron has made transparency, particularly in the extractive sectors in developing countries, a priority during Britain's presidency of the G8 group of industrialised countries, a point he underlined at the World Economic Forum in Davos last week.\nDfID's anti-corruption plans for 29 priority countries follow recommendations from the Independent Commission of Aid Impact, a watchdog, for DfID to produce an explicit anti-corruption strategy for its main partner countries.\nThe anti-corruption plan for Pakistan, which is due to receive £971m between 2012-15, will involve support for Pakistan's public accounts committee and its election commission. \"This will include calling more frequently for corruption to be tackled in regular direct dialogue with government, including discussions at federal, provincial and individual programme level,\" said DfID.\nFour-fifths of Pakistanis view government corruption as widespread. Transparency International ranked Pakistan 139 out of 176 countries in its corruption perception index. This month, Pakistan's supreme court ordered the arrest of the prime minister, Raja Pervaiz Ashraf, on corruption charges.\nIn an example of a DfID-backed initiative in Pakistan, every citizen who contacts Punjab province's local government, tax, police, health or education services will receive free automated calls or text messages where they can report if they were forced to pay a bribe or experienced bad customer service. During a three-year pilot, several corrupt officials were suspended or sacked.\nDfID also plans to improve public financial management and support citizen initiatives in all partner countries, including Nepal, which will receive £4m from DfID for anti-corruption measures, channelled through the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank.\nJustine Greening, the international development secretary, said: \"Corruption is a dead-weight which is holding countries and their people back. The UK government will not only work in countries to prevent public funds from being siphoned off or stolen – we will step up our efforts to combat corruption that uses our shores as a host.\"\nDetective chief superintendent Oliver Shaw, head of economic crime at the City of London police, said the funding enabled the overseas anti-corruption unit (OACU) to prosecute \"some of the most complex and significant cases of overseas bribery and corruption\".\nThe OACU has charged 27 people and one company, and successfully prosecuted 13 individuals, with 20 further cases under investigation. DfID is giving money to the Serious Organised Crime Agency international intelligence cell (£854,000) and the Crown Prosecution Service asset recovery (£399,000).\nCampaigners praised DfID's financial commitment to anti-corruption, but emphasised the importance of preventive measures. \"It would be even better to ensure that the money did not end up in our banks in the first place,\" said Robert Palmer with Global Witness. \"We need tighter supervision and personal criminal responsibility on the part of CEOs when dirty money ends up in banks like HSBC.\"\nBritain's biggest bank was fined $1.9bn for accepting money from Mexican drug traffickers but the US authorities decided not to prosecute HSBC amid fears that the entire banking system would have been destabilised.\n"

        "text": "\nCould it happen here?\nThe football authorities here were bemused by Europol's sudden announcement, but they and Uefa stress they do take the modern threat of match-fixing seriously.\nThe UK's professional football leagues jointly employ an agency to monitor betting markets around the world for suspicious patterns. Referees or other match officials may be changed before a match if unusual bets are placed, to remove any questions over their integrity. Lower-division matches are more likely to be targeted than those involving the multimillionaire players of the Premier League.\nRob Wainwright, Europol's director, was clearly intent on sounding the alarm over the English game, illustrated by his reference to the unspecified Champions League match played here which he said is under suspicion. Europol has not clarified which match it was, or whether, as reported by the Danish newspaper Ekstra Bladet, Wainwright was referring to Debrecen's 1-0 defeat at Liverpool in September 2009. Debrecen have confirmed their goalkeeper, Vukasin Poleksic, was questioned by Uefa after he was approached by match-fixers before that Liverpool game. However no action was taken, and there is no ongoing investigation.\nWho are Europol?\nA European Union agency whose role is principally to share information between police forces in EU member countries. \"Europol officers have no direct powers of arrest but support EU law enforcement colleagues by gathering, analysing and disseminating information and co-ordinating operations,\" Europol say of their role.\nWainwright said Europol has formed a Joint Investigation Team, codenamed Veto, to coordinate Europe-wide operations against football match-fixing.\nThe investigations by the Bochum police in Germany, which produced the convictions of 14 people in 2011, centred on the Croatian ringleader, Ante Sapina, have been the most successful so far.\nMany in football believe Europol was seeking to raise their profile by launching this week's sensational press conference, declaring 380 cases under suspicion in Europe and 300 more around the world. In 2011 Fifa gave Interpol, the international information-sharing agency, €20m to conduct a 10-year anti-match-fixing training initiative. Europol has no such partnership in football and is financed from the EU community budget; its 2011 budget was €84.8m.\nWhat happens next?\nEuropol said Veto investigations are ongoing, although little further detail was offered. Friedhelm Althans, chief investigator for the Bochum police, said Europol does have evidence for 150 of the 300 matches suspected of being fixed worldwide. The football authorities in the major European leagues, and Uefa, will continue to spend money on anti-match-fixing but, with billions being bet on the Asian markets, their strategies are far from infallible.\nThere is general agreement with Ralf Mutschke, Fifa's head of security, that more co-operation is needed between law enforcement agencies and the football world.\nFifpro, the international footballers' union, points out that match-fixing has been most prevalent in lower divisions and eastern European leagues, where players are poorly paid and often have no written contracts, so are in theory more corruptible. Fifpro is calling for better employment conditions for footballers, and more education and training.\nWhy so relatively little money (for so many fixtures) involved?\nEuropol said that of the 380 matches in Europe, more than €8m was generated in betting profits and more than €2m paid in bribes to those involved in fixing the matches. This appeared principally to be made up of the operation uncovered by the Bochum police. The activities of Sapina's gang did mostly focus on lower division matches in Germany and eastern European countries, where comparatively small amounts of money can be enough to tempt football people.\nWho is behind this?\nAlthams said the operations now under investigation are run out of Singapore. Europol emphasised that this is an extension of organised crime, so the conspirators can be from anywhere, but there has been a prevalence of Asian involvement.\nWilson Raj Perumal, who was identified as the head of a match‑fixing operation by organised crime investigators in Finland, is from Singapore. It has been reported that Perumal has disclosed information to Europol which led to its figure of 680 matches being identified.\nMost of the betting on fixed matches is placed on Asian markets, which are less well regulated, and allow in-match betting on incidents in the games, rather than the results. Singapore police have stated their commitment to co-operating with European forces to counter match-fixing.\nWhat are the chances of criminal convictions?\nDifficult. The Bochum investigation is the prize operation so far, with convictions secured following telephone tapping and surveillance. Finland's organised crime investigators also scored a success in convicting Perumal and members of his operation.\nDetecting bribery and corruption is anyway fraught, and proving an official or player acted deliberately to influence a football match is tricky.\n"

        "text": "\nTHE LORD GIVETH …\nFew books over the years have had their own press conference to mark the launch. Tolstoy, Chaucer, Dickens, Flaubert – none got the opportunity to explain their work. Which is something of a shame. Imagine the fuss that could have been avoided if the authors behind the world's great religious texts had had the chance to tell the press that it was all in fact a biting satire on the pervasive dangers of cultism, or that they were planning a sequel in which a machine-gun toting Beelzebub is the head of a South American drugs cartel and one of the apostles is just two days from retirement.\nToday, though, Lord Ferg, a man who over the years has made a habit of boycotting certain media outlets and banning others, welcomed the world's press to a room in central London to talk about his magnificent octopus – My Autobiography (the much-awaited sequel to Ferguson's 1999 book entitled, um, (Managing My Life) My Autobiography). It was all covered: Roy Keane, David Beckham, Arsène Wenger, Roberto Mancini, David Moyes. And because the embargo on the contents of the book ended at 2pm this afternoon, the internet has been awash with the choicest nuggets: the fallouts, the tantrums, the rivalries, the friendships.\nAll of which seems to be somewhat self-defeating. The Fiver had been looking forward to nuzzling down under the duvet with My Autobiography and a half a dozen Purple Tin, but today's hoopla means that throughout the afternoon the world's sporting media has been doing the literary equivalent of standing outside a cinema and shouting \"He's his father! It's a sled! He's a ghost! The boat sinks! It's really earth! His mother's a skeleton! She's really a man! He's really a woman! Dumbledore dies! Dumbledore dies! DUMBLEDORE DIES!\" at anyone walking in.\nAnd, given the breadth of the topics covered, it's a shame the book, like the nation's high streets, contains more than the odd gap. There's little or nothing on why he did not recommend José Mourinho as his successor, little or nothing on Wayne Rooney's desire to leave the club last summer, just one page on his seven-year boycott of the Beeb, and, most glaring of all, the Old-Trafford-foundation-shaking Rock of Gibraltar affair gets the sort of glossing-over only usually seen in Dulux adverts.\nSo, ironically, all the hype means you probably don't have to part with your hard-earned and actually buy the thing. But the day's Ferg-related intrigue isn't over yet. Keane comes in for the most searing criticism (\"The hardest part of Roy's body is his tongue,\" which is rather a disturbing image and must make chewing quite difficult) and the former United midfielder will be sitting on the ITV sofa for Arsenal's Big Cup tie against Borussia Dortmund this evening. Given that his standard pundit demeanour is that of a short-tempered bear who has just been handed a large tax bill and told his end of the woods is about to be demolished to make way for a bypass – all the while sat in a small room next to Adrian Chiles for longer than is humanly reasonable – his reaction when the aforementioned presenter opens the programme with \"So, Roy …\" could well make better viewing than anything Özil, Reus and co can muster.\nLIVE ON BIG WEBSITE TONIGHT\nJoin Jacob Steinberg from 7.30pm for MBM coverage of Arsenal 2-2 Borussia Dortmund, as well as John Ashdown for Schalke 1-1 Chelsea and Marcus Christenson for Meeelan 1-2 Barcelona.\nQUOTE OF THE DAY\n\"We're happy because Chico wouldn't help resolve the problem and tried to gain an advantage in the situation\" – Independiente Santa Fe spokesman Pablo Garcia reacts after his team were forced to buy knock-off replica shirts to wear against Colombian rivals Boyaca Chico. Santa Fe's kitman packed their home kit and their hosts weren't for swapping to their away one, prompting him to hotfoot it to a local market, where he picked up 10 for around £4 each. Santa Fe, fake gear and all, won 2-0.\nFIVER LETTERS\n\"I feel I must spring to the defence of David Ginola for his gesture (yesterday's Fiver letters). I took it at the time to be a bit of a subliminal message and immediately went off to make a coffee\" – Ian Ruddock.\n\"I'm fully behind the Fiver's STOP FOOTBALL campaign, but skirt-twirling, flower-in-the-hair-wearing, animal-hugging vegetarian Uncle Fiver has overstepped the mark with this one\" – Paul Crate.\n\"How are Southampton supposed to be taken seriously as potential top-four finishers and gain access to Big Cup when they drop silly points to mid-table teams?\" – Gavin Simmonds.\n\"If the pot of non-seeded teams contained the names 'France, Sweden, Romania and France' as you suggest in yesterday's Fiver, did this mean they had done some deal with Fifa to get to choose between Ukraine and Croatia?

        "text": "\nThe leader of Istanbul's bid to host the Olympics for the first time has claimed that its unique geographical position bridging two continents will give it the edge over its rivals and outlined plans to stage a spectacular opening ceremony in front of more than half a million people lining the Bosphorus.\nMuch like the successful bids from London and Rio de Janeiro, Istanbul's bid team will make much of the extent to which the Games will be embedded into the city and its culture as part of its attempt to beat Madrid and Tokyo to the prize of hosting the 2020 Games.\n\"We will have an incomparable backdrop, combining natural and architectural beauty like nowhere else,\" said Istanbul's 2020 bid leader, Hasan Arat, a former professional basketball player who is also vice-president of the Turkish Olympic Committee. \"That is why it has been a global city of inspiration for thousands of years.\n\"If the IOC awards the Games to Istanbul, in the morning you could watch the beach volleyball in Asia, in the afternoon the rugby in Europe and in the evening you can join a celebration across the continents on the banks of the Bosphorus. There is a unique opportunity for a compact, intercontinental concept.\"\nAdopting other mantras that proved successful for London and Rio, Arat promised that an Istanbul Games would be \"the people's Games\" and would be \"open, accessible and affordable\".\nIstanbul, bidding for a fifth time, is seen as a riskier choice than Tokyo and Madrid because many of the venues and infrastructure still have to be built. But Arat insisted that the non-organising committee budget of $19.2bn (£11.9m), much higher than that of its rivals, had been guaranteed by the government and was largely accounted for by major infrastructure projects that would proceed with or without the Games.\n\"Turkey has changed over the past 10 years,\" said Arat, who like the other bidders was in London over the summer as part of the IOC's observer programme. \"There is political stability, a very strong economy, big infrastructure projects, a lot of attention on sport. This is a unique opportunity for Turkey.\n\"We learned a lot from London. It is time for Istanbul to promise something incomparable,\" he added, insisting that the bid would not be harmed by longstanding corruption allegations in Turkish sport and public life.\nIn 2011 the annual European Fraud Survey by the international accounting firm Ernst & Young found 77% of Turks interviewed thought bribery and corruption commonplace. But Arat said the government was committed to a \"zero tolerance\" policy. \"They are committed to all these things at all levels of sports administration and to protecting its integrity. The law is very strong,\" he said.\nAll three bidders on Monday published the detailed candidature files handed to the International Olympic Committee, with the favourite, Tokyo, highlighting its safety, advanced infrastructure and convenience. It plans to completely renovate the stadium used for the 1964 Games, which will also serve as one of the main venues for the 2019 Rugby World Cup.\nMadrid said its bid was strengthened by Spain's sporting excellence, the capital's qualities as an attractive, modern city and the project's ability to create jobs in the recession-hit country.\nAn IOC evaluation commission inspection team, led by the British executive committee member Sir Craig Reedie, will visit each bidder in March and present its report in July. Each bidder will also present to the IOC executive board in July ahead of the final presentations and vote among the entire IOC membership in Buenos Aires on 7 September.\n"

        "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jan/06/rolls-royce-accused-bribing-chinese",
        "text": "\nRolls-Royce is facing allegations that it paid bribes to an executive involved with two Chinese airlines, in the latest claims attached to a corruption probe at the aircraft engine maker.\nThe latest allegations are contained in postings by a blogger operating under the pseudonym of \"soaringdragon\" and related to deals worth a total of $2bn (£1.25bn) with Air China in 2005 and China Eastern in 2010. They claim an executive who worked at both airlines, Chen Qin, accepted payments as an intermediary in those deals.\nRolls-Royce revealed last month that the Serious Fraud Office had approached the company over allegations of malpractice in Indonesia and China, prompting the Derby-based manufacturer to conduct its own investigation through a law firm, Debevoise & Plimpton. In a statement last month Rolls-Royce said the probe had found \"matters of concern\" in Indonesia and China and other unspecified markets, relating to \"concerns about bribery and corruption involving intermediaries in overseas markets.\"\nRolls-Royce, which is aware of the Soaringdragon postings, declined to comment on whether the blogger's allegations were included in the dossier passed to the SFO. However, the Sunday Times published a statement from China Eastern which appeared to confirm the blogger's claim that Chen Qin had been arrested by the Chinese authorities in 2011. It said: \"Neither China Eastern nor Air China has any right to talk about Chen's case; only prosecutorial organs know the real background.\"\nThe deals at the centre of the allegations boosted Rolls-Royce's presence in the rapidly growing Asian aviation market. In 2005 Rolls-Royce said it had received an order from Air China for Trent 700 engines, to power the Airbus A330, worth $800m. Then in 2010 Rolls-Royce said it had won an order from China Eastern worth $1.2bn for Trent 700 engines to power 16 A330 aircraft. The China Eastern deal was signed in the presence of David Cameron, in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, during an official trade mission to China.\nRolls-Royce faces the threat of a multimillion-pound fine on both sides of the Atlantic if the allegations escalate into official investigations by authorities, although the SFO and the US Department of Justice have yet to announce whether they will proceed with formal probes. The Soaringdragon postings are the second set of allegations implicating Rolls-Royce in corruption to be posted on the internet. Dick Taylor, a former Rolls-Royce employee in Indonesia, had alleged via a series of online postings that Tommy Suharto, the son of the former Indonesian president, was paid $20m (£12m) by Rolls-Royce and given a Rolls-Royce car to persuade the Garuda airline to buy Trent 700 engines in 1990. Taylor has said he felt \"cheated\" by his experience at Rolls-Royce, the world's second largest aircraft engine maker, after he was warned that he risked redundancy when he raised concerns over a colleague's expenses claims. Taylor subsequently took early retirement in 2004 but claims that Rolls-Royce was still making payments to intermediaries in Indonesia in 2010.\nThe Asia-Pacific region is a vital market for western aerospace companies targeting new customers amid stagnating demand at home. According to Airbus, the region will account for 35% of aircraft deliveries over the next 20 years, with China overtaking the US as the world's largest domestic airline market from 2031 onwards. As well as bringing opportunities for aircraft makers such as Airbus and Boeing, new jet sales also boost orders for engines. The front-runners for those orders are the likes of Rolls-Royce and its US rivals, General Electric and Pratt & Whitney.\nSpeaking in December, Rolls-Royce's chief executive, John Rishton, said the company would not tolerate \"improper business conduct of any sort.\"\n\"This is a company with exceptional prospects and I will not accept any behaviour that undermines its future success\". The company also announced that it will appoint an \"independent senior figure\" to review its compliance process and report to the board's ethics committee. Rolls-Royce is one of Britain's blue-chip exporters and thus a key manufacturer in George Osborne's \"march of the makers\", posting revenues of £11.3bn last year and a pre-tax profit of £1.2bn, with its strong future prospects underlined by an order book worth £62.2bn.\nRolls-Royce has admitted that the disclosures could result in the \"prosecution of individuals and the company.\" Legal experts have warned that Rolls-Royce's co-operation so far will not spare the business from a prosecution by the SFO. The organisation's new boss, David Green, has signalled that the SFO will eschew settlements in favour of prosecutions, tackling a perception that it had been keener in recent years to deal with cases outside the courtroom.\n"

        "text": "\nThe largest shareholder in Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation, the embattled FTSE 100 mining group, has refused to back a deal to buy out the company's controversial business partner in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, as the company was separately accused of opening itself to the \"gravest of corruption risks\".\nKazakhmys, another FTSE 100 miner, which owns a 26% stake in ENRC, abstained from a vote on Friday to approve the transaction, which was waved through with the support of 99.24% of the votes cast – although only 61% of the company's shares were voted in favour of the deal.\nThe company declined to explain why it opted not to back the deal, which has always been contentious. Daniel Balint-Kurti, a representative of anti-corruption group Global Witness, told the meeting: \"I strongly oppose this deal as a shareholder of ENRC. I think you are laying yourself open to the gravest of corruption risks with this, which you've already outlined in your prospectus. And whatever the legalities of it, it is completely morally wrong to rip off one of the poorest countries in the world in such a blatant fashion.\" ENRC has always said it is \"resolutely opposed\" to bribery and corruption.\nThe company is paying controversial Israeli billionaire Dan Gertler $550m (£340m) for his 50% stake in their Congo copper mining partnership, following months of pressure from politicians and campaigners.\nGertler, who is a close friend of DRC president Joseph Kabila, has been accused of being allowed to buy the country's mining assets on the cheap. He has consistently denied the allegations and, in an interview with Bloomberg earlier this month, declared he should be awarded a Nobel prize for his work in the DRC, which remains rooted to the foot of the UN's human development index.\nENRC will now control 100% of the Camrose Group, which holds stakes in a series of the country's mines. ENRC's chairman, Mehmet Dalman, added: \"This transaction is an integral part of the corporate governance and company structure optimisation which I set as a key priority when assuming the chairmanship. It is a value-enhancing transaction which will benefit both ENRC and, importantly, the people of the DRC.\"\nCracks in ENRC's relationship with Gertler began to emerge in June when Dalman, who became chairman in February, failed to back the Israeli. When asked by the Guardian if he had ever had any concerns about doing business with Gertler, Dalman replied: \"Oooh … You know that is such a leading question I'm not even going to respond to it, right? … Any comment I make, whatever you write down, it will not look right. Why would I answer that question? It is a no-win situation for me.\"\nENRC's circular to shareholders outlining the deal also contains a clause that states that Gertler's companies cannot \"materially and adversely interfere in the Camrose Group's relationships with contractors, suppliers [and] governmental entities\" nor \"initiate any action or procure, facilitate or encourage any action to be taken by a governmental entity … which results in … assets of the Camrose Group being confiscated or seized\".\nThe Camrose deal was always likely to be approved as ENRC is 45% owned by a trio of founders – Alexander Machkevitch, Patokh Chodiev and Alijan Ibragimov – while the Kazakh state holds 12% of the shares. However, Kazakhmys had been widely expected to vote with the company's board.\nENRC has suffered a terrible 2012, during which its shares have lost 55% of their value. The company has investigated allegations of corruption in its business in Kazakhstan, and is currently doing the same in Africa, in order to report its findings to the Serious Fraud Office.\n"

        "text": "\nThree billionaire oligarchs who founded the controversial FTSE 100 miner Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation are being personally sued for $27m (£17m) by their former corporate finance adviser.\nAlexander Machkevitch, Patokh Chodiev and Alijan Ibragimov – the trio of central Asian business partners who created the company – are being pursued by ENRC's former head of corporate finance, Kirill Stein, who claims he is owed unpaid fees and interest relating to his work in raising a $1.48bn loan for the group as well as its £8bn 2007 London flotation.\nThe news of the impending legal battle in London's high court comes as the company prepares to navigate yet another controversial event on Friday, as it holds a general meeting to approve a $550m deal aimed at buying out its main copper and cobalt mining partner in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).\nThe campaign group Global Witness has said it fears the acquisition presents \"corruption risks\" and that the unusual Christmas timing of the meeting \"is likely to help keep attendance at a minimum level, despite the importance of this deal for the company and, indeed, for Congo\". ENRC has said it is \"resolutely opposed\" to bribery and corruption.\nIn Stein's case against the founders – which also names three of the oligarchs' children, Mounissa Chodieva, Alla Machkevitch and Dostan Ibragimov – the financier claims to be owed $18.4m in outstanding fees, plus a further $9m in interest, after being hired to arrange a loan to fund the construction of an aluminium smelter in 2005 as well as raising finance \"by way of an initial public offering\".\nStein has already received $5m from the oligarchs, who are each worth $2.8bn according to the Forbes list of the world's billionaires. The founders and their children deny the allegations and in their defence documents the founders claim Stein was never hired to work on the flotation – which would have attracted $15.5m of the fees that allegedly remain unpaid.\nIf the case comes to court it promises to reveal many secrets around the formation of one of London's most colourful companies, which has been fighting to restore its reputation in the City after a string of controversies.\nThe company has investigated allegations of corruption in its business in Kazakhstan, and is currently doing the same in Africa, in order to report its findings to the Serious Fraud Office. As part of its efforts to tidy up its African business, ENRC said earlier this month it would spend $550m buying itself out of its Congo copper mining partnership with the controversial Israeli billionaire Dan Gertler, following months of pressure from politicians and campaign groups.\nGertler, who is a close friend of DRC president Joseph Kabila, has been accused of being allowed to buy the country's mining assets on the cheap. He has consistently denied the allegations and in an interview with Bloomberg earlier this month declared he should be awarded a Nobel prize for his work in the DRC, which remains rooted to the foot of the UN's human development index.\nThe deal is almost certain to be waved through at Friday's meeting as ENRC is 35% owned by the trio, while fellow Kazakh miner Kazakhmys owns a further 26% and the Kazakh state holds 12% of the shares.\nThe frequent bad publicity and the interest of the SFO have contributed to ENRC's shares dropping 54% this year, even though its chairman, Mehmet Dalman, has been vocal about his own efforts to hold the company to higher corporate governance standards.\nDalman's charm offensive came after he became chairman in February, following a boardroom coup in which two former directors were ousted. One described the move as being \"more Soviet than City\".\n"

        "text": "\nIt's unusually cold and wet on my first evening in New Orleans. In the gathering dark I'm lost and just a little scared as I cycle around the empty streets of the rundown Tremé district, looking for the Candlelight Lounge. Finally I see a man carrying a bass drum into a small building and realise I've found the legendary music club. I follow him in and within two minutes my fears are blown away by The Abney Effect, a funky jazz band led by trumpeter Mario Abney, who are – if you'll excuse the jazz speak – ripping the joint up.\nI'm here to meet Bob Rodrigue (\"I'll be the guy in the white hat\"), leader of the It's All About The Music bike ride, a Facebook group that meets on Tuesday nights to tours gigs all over the city. Bob, who moonlights as DJ Old Man River on New Orleans' WWOZ radio station, tells me to grab a bowl of crab gumbo, laid on free to all tonight's customers.\nI've barely had a spoonful of the spicy Cajun soup before the smiling waitress pulls me to my feet. \"Gotta come dance, baby! I got your partner right here,\" she says, leading me towards an unsuspecting woman. Like most Englishmen, I need a healthy intake of alcohol before joining in with such merriment (it's not even 6pm) but the band is so damn funky my feet start dancing all by themselves.\nI'm keen to stay for the second set but Bob says it's time to meet the rest of the group of cyclists in Congo Square (the birthplace of jazz) in Louis Armstrong Park. Tonight's gathering is smaller than usual because of the rain, but thanks to the sound system strapped to Bob's bike and the case of beer on the back of someone else's, we've got a little party on wheels going on. And everyone is so friendly I already feel like one of the gang. (Anyone with a bicycle is welcome to ride with the group, and there's no charge.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  The Candlelight Lounge, Tremé's last surviving jazz club. Photograph:\nDerek Bridges/flickr\n\n\nOur next stop is an acoustic set by indie-folk band Hurray for the Riff Raff at Euclid Records, a shop next to the levee on the corner of Desire Street – immortalised by Tennessee Williams' Streetcar – in the Bywater neighbourhood.\nThe store is packed with rare and affordable vinyl, and young hipsters who have come to hear one of the city's most talked-about new bands. It's so full I can't even see them, but within minutes the soulful bewitching voice of singer- songwriter Alynda Lee Segarra has me close to tears. (And by the end of the week, after I've begged for a ticket to her sold-out show, bought the new CD and the concert poster, I realise I'm smitten.)\nAs we head to our last gig of the night on Frenchmen Street, the rain is so heavy it feels like we're cycling through a Louisiana swamp – and I'm loving it. We pay the $5 charge (the first of the evening) and pile into the DBA club to catch the legendary Tremé Brass Band bang out jazz standards. The set is not as fresh as the first two acts we've seen but – like everyone else in this town it seems – man, can they play. By the end of the night I'm drunk, soaked to the skin and already head over heels for New Orleans.\nIn one night I've seen a large swath of this compact, bikeable city, visiting three neighbourhoods that represent its past, present and future. Tremé was not only the birthplace of jazz but is the oldest African-American neighbourhood in the US, where free people of colour worked and owned property decades before the end of slavery. Sadly the Candlelight Lounge is the last remaining club in a once-thriving musical neighbourhood. The Frenchmen Street area east of here (not to be confused with the touristy French Quarter) is the jumping musical heart of the city right now. On any night of the week you'll find world-class jazz, blues and funk for $10 or less at clubs such as Snug Harbor, the Spotted Cat and the Blue Nile – some of the best musicians have weekly residencies. Further east again, the Bywater is the neighbourhood most synonymous with post-Katrina gentrification.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  The It’s All About the Music Ride group following a brass band\n\n\nOf course, there's nothing new about falling in love with New Orleans. Its easy charm and magical mix of cultures have been beguiling visitors almost since the day the French founded it in 1718. But post-Katrina (a phrase that is now part of the lexicon), a new wave of outsiders have been seduced by the city, while New Orleanians, many of whom were forced to live in exile for months or even years, have come to love and appreciate it more than ever – like getting a second chance with a beautiful lover you've taken for granted all those years.\nThis city has always been a magnet for artists, musicians and writers, but its pull now seems stronger than ever. Among the many who have recently brought properties in the Bywater, a virtual no-go area pre-Katrina, are model and pop star Solange Knowles (Beyoncé's little sister). Thanks to tax breaks the state of Louisiana is now an attractive alternative to Hollywood and some film-makers, including Court 13, the collective that made Beasts of the Southern Wild, about a Mississippi delta community cut off by a levee, relocated here permanently. Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt (a genuine local hero after pumping millions of dollars of his own money into a rebuilding programme) have a house in the French Quarter.\nAccording to some locals, including Bob, who has lived in Louisiana nearly all his life, there is a flipside to this: \"I had to leave the Bywater because so many hipsters are too cool to say good morning – and that ain't the New Orleans way [expletives deleted, most of them prefixing the word hipster].\"\nThere's a much-quoted story about a New Yorker suing a New Orleans restaurant because his gumbo was too spicy. This was actually an internet hoax, but to me places like the Satsuma Cafe, Bywater's hipster hub, serving kale juice and organic soups, do feel more like Brooklyn or Shoreditch than New Orleans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  The fabulous Hurray for the Riff Raff performing in New Orleans earlier this year. Photograph: Josh Brasted/Getty Images\n\n\nBut there is no denying that the city has been re-energised and cleaned up. The week I'm there, Ray Nagin, the mayor during Katrina, is found guilty on 20 counts of bribery and corruption. As Bob puts it: \"While this city was on its knees after the hurricane, that [multiple expletive] was sitting on his ass in the Caribbean on a holiday paid for by kickbacks.\" Nagin was the first New Orleans mayor to stand trial for public corruption, so the decision was a real landmark.\nOne sector benefiting from the revival is the restaurant trade. This corner of Louisiana is home to the only cuisine truly born in the US – a rich mix of rustic Cajun, sophisticated Creole (itself a blend of French, Spanish, German and Italian), Caribbean and African influences. Mark Twain said: \"New Orleans food is as delicious as the less criminal forms of sin\", and the city has always been proud of its culinary history. There are now more restaurants than ever, even though the population of the city is still not back to pre-Katrina levels. Donald Link, one of the city's leading chefs, tells me: \"They have fantastic restaurants in New York, Chicago and San Francisco, but if you closed your eyes you might not know which of those cities you were eating in.\"\nYou could never say that about New Orleanian cuisine, which is clearly one Link thinks is worth fighting for. When Katrina struck he was in the process of setting up two new restaurants, and friends advised him to take the insurance money and run. He did the opposite, forging a security pass so he could return to the city only a week after the hurricane, when the place was still deserted, and start rebuilding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Grilled Louisiana shrimp at Cochon restaurant\n\n\nSince then he hasn't looked back, now owning five restaurants, including Cochon in the Warehouse District, which serves sophisticated versions of the southern-Cajun dishes he grew up with. Cochon (which in Louisiana means roast pork: they serve it with cabbage and plenty of crackling) specialises in nose-to-tail pig dishes, including Link's signature spicy sausages. For one of the best restaurants in town it is pleasingly down to earth – the music loud, prices fairly reasonable. If you can't get a table, the annex, Cochon Butcher, is a \"swine bar and deli\", offering sandwiches of pork belly, oyster and bacon or the fantastic muffuletta. The latter is a sarnie invented by Italian immigrants to New Orleans: layered with mortadella, salami, mozzarella, ham and provolone, it will do you in for the day. Yes, it's all about the hog here, but the cooking is so good they even make Brussels sprouts taste sexy – flash-fried and dressed with olive oil and red chilli.\nLike many people I speak to, Link is adamant that the city is in much better shape than before Katrina. \"You've heard of the Big Easy?\" he says. \"Well a lot of that is just bullshit that stood for corruption and laziness. That's changing now, partly because people are bringing a new energy with them.\"\nOne New Orleans native who did just that is Neal Bodenheimer. While many people were forced to leave the city to rebuild their lives after Katrina, Bodenheimer, a mixologist who had been working at high-end bars in New York, felt a call to return and do his bit for his devastated hometown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Cure cocktail bar. Photograph: Kevin O'Mara\n\n\nWith two associates, he opened the Cure cocktail bar on Freret Street in Uptown, in 2009. Every bar in New Orleans does cocktails – there's even an annual cocktail festival attended by bartenders from around the world – but until Cure there was nowhere that applied such microscopic attention to detail (one of the barmen even has a cocktail manifesto). The Ramos gin fizz I tried was like boozy lime soufflé, so delicious I scraped the glass clean with my finger to finish off the creamy whipped egg white.\nCure is housed in a beautiful former fire station with exposed brick walls and an entire back wall lined with hundreds of bottles of all shapes and colours, backlit and rising towards the high ceiling like an altar to drinking. When the bar opened, the surrounding area had almost been abandoned.\n\"People said we were a little crazy to open here but it was the only place we could afford,\" says Bodenheimer. The leap of faith has proved successful and Freret Street is today buzzing with restaurants and businesses, thanks largely to Cure's pioneering success.\nThe owners have just opened a restaurant, Cane and Table, in a dilapidated, atmospheric building in the French Quarter, which specialises in rum (obviously there are cocktails) and Caribbean-inspired sharing plates. It's sophisticated drinking food really, and as I'm several cocktails in to the evening when I arrive, dishes like the yummy crispy rum ribs, coated in rice flour and fried, really hit the spot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  A barbecue restaurant in the Bywater. Photograph: Alamy\n\n\nSome of the best food I eat is at Sylvain, in an 18th-century carriage house and former brothel in the French Quarter. The owner pays homage to the old, mystical New Orleans: each night the bartender leaves out a glass of sazerac, the city's signature cocktail, and lights a candle for Aunt Rose Arnold, the former madame who is said to haunt the building.\nAnd while the food is rooted in the Cajun and Creole tradition, it comes with a modern twist. Veal sweetbreads melt in the mouth like warm butter, beef cheeks are just as tender, and the Gulf of Mexico prawns are as juicy as fresh fruit. And like everything I eat here, it is deliciously rich, and the there's no holding back on spices and seasoning – or the volume level.\nThey don't do background music in New Orleans; they do foreground music. Even in my classy, old-school hotel, the Bourbon Orleans, the music playing over breakfast (fried oysters or steak and eggs with shrimp sauce) is a notch or two louder than you'd expect, and it's proper pumping bebop rather than elevator jazz. And even in such grand surroundings there's a wonderful informality. As the hotel has no garage, I'm worried about where I can leave my bike at night, but the staff tell me to wheel it through the white marble lobby, with its sparkling chandeliers, to my room – as if it's the most natural thing in the world. I could't see that happening in London or New York.\nHiring a bike for the week was a great decision. The city is flat and small enough to cycle across in a day. I got mine, a single-speed, funky black cruiser with chunky whitewall tyres and chrome and red trim, from the American Bicycle Rental Company (+1 504 324 8257, bikerentalneworleans.com, $36 a day or $165 a week). The company also runs guided historical bike tours , which are a great way to learn about the city as you can see so much on a gentle three-hour ride.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  An historical ride of the city with New Orleans Bike Tours\n\n\nMy man Bob also leads cycle tours of the city (bigeasybiketours.com), and though I didn't get the chance to take one, on my last day in town he takes me on a ride down to the Lower Ninth Ward. This is the poor neighbourhood that was devastated by Katrina, where the harrowing images beamed around the world of people stranded for days on their roofs were taken, and where many properties still lie abandoned.\nMost people told me to stay clear of the area but on this Sunday morning it's a carnival, with half the neighbourhood out on the street to see the CTC Steppers Parade and their marching band warming up for Mardi Gras. We park our bikes and join the crowd almost running alongside them (the band really does quick march) down the main drag lined with barbecue trucks and beer sellers. With everyone dancing and having such a good time it's impossible to imagine the horrors seen here less than a decade ago. Today, like every day I've spent in this magical city, it feels like the air is filled with joy.\n• The trip was provided by America As You Like (020-8742 8299, americaasyoulikeit.com), which offers seven nights in New Orleans from £1,195pp or four nights from £930, including accommodation and flights with United Airlines.

        "date": "2013-05-03T07:00:00Z",
        "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/may/03/perilous-question-antonia-fraser-review",
        "text": "\nTwo hundred years ago the world's \"oldest democracy\", as Margaret Thatcher liked to call it, was staggeringly undemocratic. The total electorate in England and Wales was a mere 366,000, about 11% of the total of adult males. Constituencies were so unequal in size that more than half the 513 MPs were returned by a grand total of 11,000 voters. Scotland, then a country of two million people, returned 45 MPs, chosen by a total electorate of less than 3,000. More than half of all supposed representatives of the people, in the Commons, were put there by members of the House of Lords, who claimed constituencies as their personal property, to be bought and sold at will. There was a yawning north-south divide: Leeds, Sheffield, Manchester and Birmingham had no representatives, while 21 little towns in Cornwall returned two members each, and the counties along the south coast, with 15% of the population of England, returned a third of all English MPs.\nAt general elections, bribery was normal, but fewer than half the seats in the Commons were contested, because the cost of bribing a majority of the voters was so high. In many constituencies, however, elections could be bought, and to keep the electors honest they were required to declare, in public, who they were voting for, so that they could not be bribed by one candidate and vote for another. The secret ballot, according to apologists for this system, would have been inimical to the \"manly spirit\" of the British people – though, as the eloquent radical Henry Hunt pointed out, in gentleman's clubs no other system of election would have been tolerated. This was the constitution, palpably chaotic and corrupt, that some defended as \"the perfection of human reason\". Two years before the \"great\" Reform Act of 1832, the Duke of Wellington, the Tory prime minister, declared that the state of the representation of the people had been designed by providence: it \"could not be improved\"; it had, because it deserved to have, \"the full and entire confidence of the country\".\nSome people, however, whose confidence in the perfection of these arrangements was less than entire, had been campaigning for a reform of parliament since the late 1770s, chiefly motivated by a determination to destroy, or at least to limit, electoral bribery and corruption. It was in the smaller borough constituencies that elections were easy to fix, and moderate reformers believed the answer was to tilt the balance of the Commons more towards county constituencies, where electorates were too big to bribe. Others demanded universal manhood suffrage (almost no one thought of enfranchising women), with general elections every year, so that bent MPs would not have long to enrich themselves before being sent packing. By 1830, the demand from outside parliament for reform was becoming impossible to ignore, and the following year the Whigs, led by Earl Grey, a moderate reformer since the 1790s, brought forward a bill to abolish the most egregiously rotten boroughs, to provide a degree of representation in the Commons to the largest industrial towns, and to reduce the property qualification for voters in borough constituencies to a common standard. The effect was to increase the overall electorate from 11% to 18%. There was still to be no secret ballot, not until 1872.\nIt seems a very modest proposal, but it outraged many Tories. Both parties were becoming alarmed at the pressure exerted by the extra-parliamentary movement for reform, its militancy increased by economic distress and the rising price of food. Both feared a British version of the revolution that had just propelled the intransigent Bourbon Charles X from Rambouillet to his hideaway in Holyrood. For Whigs, the way forward was to offer reform, just enough to detach the middle classes from their alliance with working-class reformers and so hopefully to prevent an explosion. The Tories, however, claimed that the slightest measure of reform would precipitate, not prevent, an English revolution. Wellington, stupidly wrong as he so often was, declared that even so moderate a reform as the bill proposed would be \"a greater political crime than any committed in history\". It would lead inevitably, warned the ultra-Tories, to the destruction of property, of the monarchy, of the country.\nThe manoeuvres that led to the eventual passing of the bill were immensely complicated. There was a struggle, sometimes murderously violent, between the upholders of law and order and those demonstrating and rioting in the street; a furious conflict between Whigs and Tories; and, above all, once a clear majority for reform had been established in the Commons, a bitter standoff between the Whig majority in the lower house and the Tory majority in the Lords. Eventually, the vacillating William IV, under duress skilfully applied by Grey, threatened to create enough peers to ensure that the bill would pass, and Francis Place, the radical tailor, organised a run on the banks under the slogan \"Go for Gold\". The Lords gave in, apparently preferring to see the destruction of property, king and country than any dilution of their blue blood or the loss of the Tory majority in the upper house.\nThese were exciting times, and a number of writers have attempted to write a narrative of the bill's passing, including Edward Pearce, a one-time writer for both the Guardian and the Daily Telegraph, whose fine book Reform! The Fight for the 1832 Reform Act was published 10 years ago. So what does Antonia Fraser do that other writers have not done before? I'm not sure. Like Pearce, she relishes what she calls the \"drama\" of the bill's passage and quotes extensively from the parliamentary debates to bring out their theatricality. The book, she explains, is an attempt not to write \"a history of Reform\", but \"to give the flavour of the times\". The first point is right enough: Fraser's understanding of the events of 1830-32 in the light of the earlier campaigns for reform is slight, and this gives her account of the bill's passage a thin, one-dimensional feel. She knows about the mainly gentlemanly Yorkshire Association and the largely aristocratic Friends of the People, but not, it seems, about the far more influential reform societies of the 1790s whose members were mainly artisans. The writings and dialogues she quotes make frequent reference to the language of earlier campaigns for reform, but she seems unaware of these vital resonances.\nAs for the flavour of the times, it has none of the complexity that the hosts of reality cooking shows look out for. It is the flavour as tasted by aristocrats. We learn that in the early 19th century \"the phrase 'the people' generally implied a mob\" – and so it did for some; for others, \"the people\" were the only legitimate source of sovereignty. \"The rule of the people\", it seems, \"was anathema\" – and so it was for many, but then again for many it was their ultimate goal. Nepotism, apparently, \"was the mentality of the age\", and so it was for many politicians, but not for those who saw it as a central feature of \"Old Corruption\". The point of view of the aristocracy is the default position from which this book makes most of its judgments about what \"the age\" believed. Fraser sees the opposition to reform of the \"traditional Tory aristocrats\" as deriving from an innate and deep sense of responsibility to preserve the stability of the country. It was this, it seems, that led them to insist on their right to continue buying votes and trading constituencies, to usurp the role of the Commons by packing it with their creatures, and thus to put at risk the very stability that the moderate reformers were trying to preserve.\nFraser grants a decent role to the middle-class reformer Thomas Attwood and to Francis Place; William Cobbett gets a walk-on part, and is credited with founding the Poor Man's Guardian, which would surprise him. But, in general, the extra-parliamentary campaigners are treated not as the chief drivers of reform but as noises off, to which the noble lords on stage respond. Fraser even thinks aristocrats have a distinctive physical conformation. Not all of them, of course: the burly Lord Althorp, future Earl Spencer, had \"nothing visibly aristocratic about him\", and Lord John Russell, a son of the Duke of Bedford, was too short for his role. But in the main, aristocrats, are \"fine upstanding\" men with long \"patrician\" noses. Remember when the House of Lords was full of hereditaries, basking like seals after lunch on the benches? Banish them from your mind. Think Vinnie Jones instead, or the young Jim Davidson, upstanding men both, with long noses, \"visibly aristocratic\".\n• John Barrell's Edward Pugh of Ruthin is published by the University of Wales Press.\n"

        "text": "\nBP will open discussions this week with potential purchasers over the sale of its half of joint Russian venture TNK-BP, which could lead to a $30bn windfall.\nThe oligarchs who belong to the Alfa Access Renova (AAR) consortium that own the other 50% of the venture will tell BP they want to exercise their right to negotiate for the stake.\nThe Russians have indicated they will only offer $7bn (£4.5bn), for half of the BP stake, claiming that a further $3bn would be accounted for by AAR dropping claims for compensation over the failure of a previous attempt by BP to tie up a separate deal with Rosneft against the wishes of the oligarchs.\nBP, which has been in conflict with its Russian shareholders for a long time, will on Saturday be allowed to widen purchase talks to some of other companies that have expressed an interest in the 50% holding as a 45-day notice period runs out.\nNeither BP nor AAR was willing to comment but industry sources confirmed that moves to finalise the future TNK-BP ownership structure would move into a different phase this week.\nA host of major names have been suggested as alternative buyers to AAR, including ExxonMobil and Shell as well as Chinese and Russian firms. Most independent analysts believe BP could obtain as much as $30bn for its stake.\nNone of those alternative firms has publicly confirmed their interest and in an interview with the Wall Street Journal two weeks ago Alfa Group chairman, Mikhail Fridman, claimed there were \"no serious buyers\" outside his own consortium.\nHe also believed that the Kremlin would support an AAR takeover while \"any foreign company would face a very complex process of getting approvals\".\nAAR is said to have failed to drum up support from the international loan market for a $20bn financing that would help it to acquire BP's stake, according to the International Financing Review website. That publication speculated that AAR might eventually turn out to be a seller of its own 50% stake rather than a buyer.\nBP announced on 1 June that it had received a number of unsolicited approaches for a stake that had yielded enormous profits for the UK oil company since it was bought in 2003 for $8bn.\nIn a separate development, the head of BP's London-based tanker chartering business, who had been suspended pending a bribery investigation, has left the company.\nBP said that Lars Dencker Nielsen had left for \"personal reasons\" while its internal inquiry and that of the Serious Fraud Office continued.\nThe whereabouts of Dencker Nielsen was unknown but the Danish national has previously denied any wrongdoing while BP said his post was being filled temporarily by \"regional managers\".\nThe affair emerged in April when a whistleblower inside BP sent a letter to its chief executive, Bob Dudley, as well as one to the SFO, setting out what he claimed was a five-year catalogue of bribery and corruption within the chartering department of BP Shipping.\n• This article was amended on 20 July 2012. The original said that the Russians indicated they would only offer $7bn, claiming that a further $13bn would be accounted for by other means. This has been corrected.\n"

        "text": "\nFired up perhaps by his engagement to a woman 49 years younger than himself, the 76-year-old Silvio Berlusconi has announced his return to politics. He will head the centre-right Popolo della Libertà (PDL) in spring elections. His successor – the unelected Mario Monti – is, he says, pushing the country into recession with his austerity programme, and the PDL will no longer support him.\nIn response, Monti immediately announced his resignation. European leaders threw up their arms in horror. The markets got nervous and interest rates on Italian government bonds shot up. Important elements of Berlusconi's party rebelled and threatened a split; if Monti stands as a candidate for a centrist coalition, they will join him, they say. Meanwhile, the Partito Democratico (PD), the leftwing opposition, is gloating. With opinion polls giving them a good lead, the election seems in the bag.\nWhat does Berlusconi do? He says that if Monti stands for election, he will withdraw his own candidacy and support him. Bizarre? He then says that, if he is elected himself, his first action will be to abolish a hated property tax that Monti slapped on first-home ownership. At once, the threat of a split in the PDL fades. If Monti enters the fray, the rebels will be able to support him from within the PDL. If he doesn't, then they have no leader to leave the party for.\nSo the spotlight is on Monti; this affable, civilised man must decide if he's ready for the mudslinging and misinformation of a real election campaign. Don't do it, scream senators on the left. Alarmingly, Berlusconi's manoeuvering has put their victory in doubt. The more they tell Monti not to stand, the more vulnerable they seem.\nDoes any of this matter to the British reader? Does it do anything other than confirm that the Italian political scene is chaotic and incomprehensible, even for those of us who've lived in the country for 30 years? I think it does.\nFirst, Berlusconi is not a buffoon. It's true he's on trial for inducing a minor to prostitution. It's true he has been endlessly in court on charges of bribery and corruption. It's true that he never fails to produce comically inappropriate innuendos at international summits. But in politics, context is everything. Berlusconi owns large parts of the Italian press, and that makes other parts of it wary of attacking him. He is vastly wealthy and proportionately dangerous.\nHis criticism of Monti's economic policy is exactly Ed Miliband's criticism of Cameron's. His position on the euro – that it is unsustainable and largely responsible for Italy's declining competitiveness – is comparable with the prevailing orthodoxy in the UK. He is the only senior Italian politician with the courage to say such things, though he regularly eats his words as soon as spoken. In general, he allows everyone who responds to his charm to believe that he shares their views. The madder the man seems, the more you can be sure there is method in his mayhem.\nBut the deeper significance of Berlusconi's return is its revelation of a crisis of leadership, something hardly limited to Italy. In an attempt to boost their party leaders, Italians have taken to the US habit of holding primaries. It hasn't worked. The left has just reelected Pier Luigi Bersani, an agreeable but yawningly dull party stalwart. From the moment the left started bowing to economic necessity and backing pension cuts and tax increases, it lost all ideological steam, and now excites no one at all.\nOn the right, the PDL was about to hold primaries when Berlusconi intervened and had them called off. There were no suitable candidates, he claimed. As a result, he was simply obliged to come back himself. This might appear to be megalomania, but there is a general perception he was right. None of the motley group of yes men who put themselves forward for the primaries had any chance of inspiring the public.\nAside from the main leaders, there are comedian Beppe Grillo and economist Mario Monti. Grillo, a heavily bearded, rudely physical presence whose brutal charisma flowers mainly in the territory of insult, has formed a popular movement which attributes all the country's ills to its evil politicians, offering honesty and integrity as its only policies. Surveys give Grillo around 17% of the vote. Nobody has any idea what his presence in an eventual government might mean.\nMonti himself hesitates to stand. He is not a politician. He has no vision for the future beyond putting some order into Italy's fiscal system and keeping European partners and international investors happy. His success to date is as much one of image as achievement: the fact he is not a politician who is trying to please the people cheers up the bankers hugely.\nThis absence of political vision is no doubt related to the fact that, even if elected, a leader's powers are minimal. If no one has the stomach to abandon the euro, then there is little one can do but toe the austerity line. Since Europe is guided from Berlin and Paris, there is no way Italy can exercise much influence on its policies. Italian papers regularly complain that the country is becoming a European colony. The overwhelming feeling is one of being trapped in a world machine of inexorable momentum; the only thing a leader can do is fight for a bit of candy at some summit, then try to share it out at home without having his fingers bitten off. The larger picture is beyond his grasp. With no power there is no point in having vision. Put the other way round, people who do have vision will not waste their time in roles where they have no power.\nCrises famously serve to prompt therapeutic change. This can't happen if all a leader feels he can do is keep a moribund nation on life support in the hope that a miracle drug might be discovered. That is the point European politics is at. One of the last measures the Monti government has passed is a decree that saves ILVA, the huge steel plant in Taranto, from being closed. Pollution from ILVA is blamed for rising cancer rates in the area, although lawyers for the plant deny there is a link. Local magistrates had ordered the arrest of the company's owners and sought to close it. But thousands of jobs and vast wealth are at stake. Monti's decree reopened the plant, promising cleaner industrial processes. Few believe they will be imposed. The newspapers hardly report the ongoing local protests: the school massacre in Connecticut offers a much easier subject. Nobody even mentions the possibility of a world less driven by the need to produce steel.\nThe underlying message is always that the problems – world trade, global warming – are too big to tackle. This sense of impotence is now general throughout Europe. Amid all this, a flamboyant Berlusconi, who uses his declining energies to keep his business empire intact, regardless of the collective good, is actually wonderfully emblematic of where our culture stands.\n"

        "text": "\nThe recession is having an effect on the pressures that employees feel to behave unethically, a new survey from the Institute of Business Ethics has found.\nThe IBE's ethics at work survey, which was last carried out in 2008, asks employees about their attitudes to ethical issues in the workplace, their perceptions regarding ethical practices in their organisations and what formal assistance on ethical matters their organisations provide for them.\nEncouragingly, the majority of British (84%) and mainland European (77%) employees say that honesty is practiced \"always or frequently\" in their organisation.\nAlthough the proportion of British full-time workers who say they have felt pressure to compromise their organisation's ethical standards remains similar to 2008 (9% and 11% respectively), as does the prevalence of an unethical culture (18%), British employees seem to be significantly more likely to experience certain types of pressure to behave unethically than in previous years. The most common of these include meeting unrealistic business objectives or targets (19%) and being asked to take short cuts (14%).\nWanting to help their organisation survive was mentioned for the first time as a source of pressure (7%), an indication that the recession is taking its toll on ethical standards.\nOf the fifth of British employees who have been aware of misconduct in their organisation in the last year, only half of these (51%) say they have reported it. Similarly, of the quarter (28%) of mainland European employees who said they had been aware of misconduct, only half raised their concerns.\nAttitudes of indifference (\"It's none of my business\") and the belief that no corrective action would be taken, deter employees who are aware of misconduct from raising their concerns, the survey found. It's clear that organisations need to work harder at communicating the importance of speaking up, and supporting staff who do.\nWhile it's encouraging that employees feel they work in ethical companies, a continued recession and with it the pressure to act unethically, could see businesses at risk of suffering reputation hits, or worse.\nNo 'lone gunmen' in business ethics\nIn business ethics, there are no lone gunmen – the theory that integrity failures are caused by just one person behaving badly. UBS was fined £29.7m last month by the FSA for failures in its systems and controls that allowed former employee Kweku Adoboli to conduct Britain's biggest bank fraud. Integrity crises are usually the result of a gradual erosion in behaviour over time, which develop into an unethical culture, rather than one person acting on their own while everyone else stands by, powerless.\nWhile we celebrate that the majority feel their workplace is one where honesty is practiced, this is undermined by the statistic that a third of those in managerial or supervisory roles in British organisations perceive \"petty fiddling\" as inevitable.\nBut why fret about a few biros and A4 pads missing from the stationery cupboard when there are bigger risks like bribery and corruption and health and safety to mitigate against?\nConsider the broken windows theory: a building is vandalised with a few broken windows. If the windows are not repaired, the vandals break a few more; eventually the building is broken into and squatters move in. The theory is that petty crimes, if unaddressed, create a culture which leads to larger ones.\nNew York's Mayor, Rudy Giuliani, put this theory to practical use in his zero-tolerance of petty crimes such as vandalism in New York. The result was turning around a city that once seemed ungovernable, particularly when it came to crime. Overall crime rates dropped by 44% to their lowest in more than a generation, and the city's murder rate went down by 70%. Petty fiddling at work is a little like those broken windows.\nNew research by Dr Muel Kaptein of the Rotterdam School Of Management into why good people do bad things may give cause for concern. Kaptein cites \"acceptance of small theft\" as something which may indicate a culture susceptible to integrity failure. If small thefts of highlighter pens are ignored, then so are slightly larger ones, like over-claiming expenses or accepting unauthorised business gifts. It doesn't take long for people to begin pushing those limits, and before long you have a large scale integrity failure on your hands.\nThe ethics at work survey found that just under half of the UK's full-time workforce thinks it's acceptable to take pencils and pens (41%) and make personal phone calls (45%) from work and about a third (30%) said it was OK to post personal mail from work. A quarter think it is acceptable to use the internet in work time and a fifth of British employees feel it is acceptable to \"take a sicky\". The survey also showed that there is little difference in attitudes between employees and managers.\nIf the tone is set by managers that these small ethical breaches are unacceptable, then perhaps the tone and culture will follow. Most people do not start out to be malicious, or to harm the organisation or defraud it – they are just trying to do their job.\nBut the survey found that employees in organisations that provide ethics training are significantly less likely to say they have felt pressured to compromise ethical standards and are also significantly more likely to report misconduct of which they are aware. The message is clear: it is up to organisations to make sure their staff have the tools to do their jobs in an ethical way.\nSimon Webley is research director at the Institute of Business Ethics.

        "text": "\nDespite best efforts we are not winning the war on poaching. A massive seizure of 1.5 tons of ivory in Kenya's port city of Mombasa on 3 July flies in the face of threats against poachers and dealers by the Kenya government, and yet ivory traffickers continue unabated. In the first six months of 2013 more than 7.5 tons of ivory was seized in the country - more than was seized in all of 2012.\nBy all measures, elephants are much worse off than last year; ivory continues to flow through the country at increasing rates, and the slaughter of elephants is accelerating. The public, CITES, conservationists and the world criticizes Kenya for her failure to match words with actions. The situation is rapidly spiraling out of control. \nKenya has taken many decisive actions. Thirty-two staff including senior officers of the Kenya Wildlife Service were sent home for involvement or suspicion of involvement in driving the crisis, the list of shame includes senior officers in the security department. The government is enacting new legislation, committing additional funds to hire 1,000 new rangers, and private sector has also redoubled their efforts through increasing investment in anti-poaching with special training, more monitoring, drones, sniffer dogs, attack dogs, vehicles, 1000$ worth of remote cameras and aircraft. \nDespite these military efforts to stop the poachers, the problem is worsening. As Julius Kimani, Deputy Director of Security in KWS said in a meeting last week \n\n\"We cannot win this war with guns, it is time to explore more intelligent ways of motivating people to stop killing our most magnificent species.\"\n\nChanging trends in poaching\nThere was a time when despite the costs and risks, Kenyans defended elephants. Poaching elephants for ivory was unacceptable to most, and those who engaged in it were demeaned. In the 1970's and 80's poachers mostly the tough wiry Somali people who entered Kenya on foot from the north with guns under their shuka's (sarongs). They followed the tracks of elephants, shot them and buried the ivory for collection at a later date. It was a low tech business. Today the poaching and trafficking of ivory is no longer the prestige of the Somali, it is being done by all tribes, professionals, and individuals of all walks of life: \n\nIn April a young university student was arrested at a Kenyan shopping mall in a smart SUV full of ivory. \nLocal community members once considered the buffer against poachers from outside are now poaching. \nLocal poaching rings operate with impunity in Kenya \nStaff and ex-staff of conservation bodies are now doing the poaching themselves. Army officers have been arrested on suspicion of poaching. \n Two renowned Kenyan elephant conservationists have been arrested on charges of ivory trafficking. \nOn 29th of June an American traveller was arrested at Nairobi International Airport and charged with smuggling ivory. \n\nAt this rate it is conceivable that anybody could be suspected of involvement in the ivory trafficking business because it is not poverty that drives people to kill elephants or traffic ivory. Why is it that so many people are now involved in poaching and trafficking of ivory? \nUnderstanding the psychology of poachers\nIn a recent discussion with behavioral economist and professor at Duke University Dan Ariely, I was challenged to think about the human motivations behind the poaching. Ariely, the author of three New York Times Best Sellers Predictably Irrational, The Upside of Irrationality, and The Honest Truth about Dishonesty has studied motivations behind the actions of criminals. \nI spoke to Ariely about the Kenyan government response to the crisis, by enacting extreme penalties to discourage poachers. Like others I have a gut feeling that higher penalties may not work, I fear that instead suspects will bribe the police, the price of ivory will increase to compensate and thus accelerate the killing. Ariely said I had a point, but not necessarily for the reasons I thought. \nI learned three important things about behavioral economics that are relevant to poaching. \n1. Everyone is dishonest to the limit of social acceptance\nFirst, Ariely's research suggests that when many of people are doing bad things, it is easier for anyone to view it as socially acceptable and starting engaging in this activity as well. Ariely's logic suggests that the more we report the scale of ivory trafficking and elephant poaching, the more it seems ubiquitous and therefore people will think \"Everyone else is doing it so why not me?\". It seems counter intuitive but what this means is that the more awareness we create about poaching and ivory trafficking, the worse it's going to get. At least as long as the awareness is not tightly connected with moral disgust and condemnation. \nHis research also finds that we tend to do bad things only up to a limit, and that limit is defined by our own personal standards of acceptable dishonesty. For example, everyone may steal a little, and even when given the opportunity to take more, people tend to restrict their cheating to a certain level which is defined by personal and social norms. It is a kind of social learning, where we observe other peoples' actions as a way to figure out what is OK and what is not. \nSocial acceptance of many dishonest activates such as drug use, infidelity, doping by elite athletes, bribery and corruption may be rooted in repeated media stories about more and more individuals engaging in thee activities – leading us to view these activities as more commonplace. We then rationalize our cheating behavior and say \"I know it's wrong, but so what, everyone else is doing it\". We see this daily in Kenya where drink driving is socially acceptable and many people do it. Yet few Kenyans would dream of drink driving in USA or UK where there is no social acceptance of this kind of behavior.\n2. Criminals start small\nThe second thing I learned from Ariely is that most criminals start off small, whether it's insider trading or drug crimes. Once they get started it is easier to do a little more, and before long they are doing things that initially were unthinkable. Culprits often report surprise and horror about the scale of what they are doing when they get caught. It's what we affectionately call the slippery slope, once you are on it you will stay on it and it just gets worse and worse. To many people, committing a crime, no matter how small, is like losing your virginity; once it's gone it can't be reclaimed. But the good news is that we do have mechanisms to reboot and start over. Think of confession in the Catholic Church. \n3. Risk of getting caught deters criminals more than the size of the penalty\nThe third thing I learned is that the likelihood of someone engaging in criminal activity is related less to the severity of the penalty and more to the likelihood of getting caught – and particularly when the probability is very high (think about crossing a red light when the fine is $1,000 and the probability is 1% vs a situation where the fine is $0 and the probability is 100%). Ariely's research finds that despite the fines and jail terms for drug dealing, people still do it, especially in places where the odds of getting caught are low, and especially where there is a culture of crime. So according to this argument, as long as there is a high probability of getting away with it, a poacher might continue to take the risks no matter how high the penalty. From this perspective, higher penalties in an unchanged world of poor investigations, and high corruption, might even escalate the problem as more people stepping onto the slippery slope and the dark world of wildlife crime. All of this means that while stiffer penalties (if they get executed) will certainly get hundreds if not thousands of people into jail for 15 years or more (which is far from ideal), it is not likely to stop the killings. \nAriely concluded \n\n\"Rather than creating stiff punishments for offenders if they are caught, we need to change the moral standing on these issues and the educational process that leads to our understanding of the unacceptability of such behaviors\". \n\nHow can we apply behavioural economics to save elephants? \nFrom Ariely's research we can take two lessons and actions that might stem the flow of poachers, and reverting those already in crime back to a life of honesty. First we must address the perception that everyone is poaching and stop those people from becoming engaged in poaching or ivory trafficking because everyone else is doing this. This may be possible through social messaging mechanisms. Poaching must become a socially unacceptable practice, morally wrong, and a taboo. \nSecondly, we should look for a way to give those who have just entered onto the thin edge of the slippery slope, a reason to jump off it. African traditions are replete with examples of traditional courts that allow petty criminals to be forgiven. The convict apologizes, pays the penalty, promises not to do it again, and returns to society. This was most famously, if not, controversially applied in the case of the Rwanda genocide through the traditional and officially recognized Gacaca courts. \nHonoring traditional values to save elephants\nTraditional courts have been shown to be effective for wildlife crimes. For example, in May when the rhino named Omni was killed in Ilingwesi, north Kenya. Government efforts to trace the killers failed until the elders decided to use traditional methods. They gave the culprits 10 days to face up to the crime or risk being cursed. On the tenth day two men came forward. They were immediately fined 3 cows each as per tradition, and then taken to a police station for formal charges. The public acknowledgement, show of remorse, apology and repentance allows these men to return to society though their community is likely to be keeping a close eye on them. Not much publicity or recognition has been accorded to this case which may hold the answer for changing values.\nIf Ariely is right, then conservationists and governments should begin seriously thinking about how to prevent ordinary people from losing their 'virginity' and entering into the shadowy world of wildlife crime. Unless the social acceptance of corruption and bribery are significantly reduced, it is unlikely that much will be gained in terms of reducing crime of all kinds in Kenya. Poaching and ivory trafficking must once again become so socially unacceptable that communities will not tolerate their own getting involved. By applying behavioral lessons to the problem, we can recognize and empower traditional African courts to honour our African values, change perceptions and grow a community that defends elephants despite the economic incentives.\n"

        "text": "\nWhen is a coup not a coup? This vexed question has been exercising the citizens of the Maldives ever since their first democratically elected president, Mohamed Nasheed, was driven from office in February amid a violent rampage by police mutineers. His successor, former vice-president Mohamed Waheed, claims to hold power legitimately. Opponents including members of Nasheed's Maldivian Democratic party (MDP) say Waheed now oversees a \"police state\" and warn of deepening political rifts and ever greater human rights abuses.\nThe crisis that erupted in the Indian Ocean republic eight months ago caused widespread alarm. Nasheed, a former political prisoner, was voted into office in 2008 after 30 years of autocratic rule by Maumoon Abdul Gayoom. The result was widely hailed as a triumph for democracy. But the old regime took defeat badly. Resentment turned into open revolt after Nasheed ordered the detention of the chief justice of the criminal court, who was suspected of obstructing investigations into bribery and corruption allegations involving former regime figures.\nWhen disgruntled police officers joined anti-Nasheed street demonstrators and religious non-governmental organisations in demanding the president's removal on the night of 6-7 February, Maldives army chiefs hesitated, then refused to intervene. According to a report, Arrested Democracy, by three independent experts commissioned by the MDP, vice-president Waheed sent a message of encouragement to the mutineers while his brother entered the state television offices and informed staff that Waheed was now commander-in-chief.\nInitially, Nasheed was said to have resigned voluntarily. But the independent report describes a dramatic scene in which Nasheed, inside army headquarters, is surrounded by \"around 80 military personnel\", most of whom want him to quit and are saying the only way he can stay in power is to use lethal forces against the mutineers. To his credit, Nasheed says he will not give the order to open fire. \"At this point it seems that the president realised he had no other option but to resign, and he pleaded for his safety and for the safety of his family,\" the report states.\nHours later, freed from the glowering presence of hostile military and police, Nasheed stated publicly that his resignation was made under duress and called for early elections to resolve the crisis. But what followed instead, as Waheed established himself in power, was a harsh police crackdown that has now been chronicled by Amnesty International.\n\"Police have carried out beatings, arbitrary detentions, attacks on the injured in hospitals and torture, yet not a single criminal case has been filed against those responsible,\" Amnesty investigator Abbas Faiz said. People were specifically targeted for their political affiliation, he said. Several horrifying cases are documented, including an attack on Mariya Ahmed Didi, an MP. \"Police and military officers forcefully opened my eyelids ... They sprayed pepper spray directly into my eye. Then they did the same with the other eye ... At one point when they were beating me one of them shouted: 'Is she still not dead?'' she said.\nAlarmed by Nasheed's abrupt departure and the violent aftermath, Britain, the Commonwealth, the US, the UN and India backed an independent investigation and called for fresh elections. This investigation, conducted mostly by government appointees and known as the Commission of National Inquiry (Coni), reported last week. Surprisingly, it concluded that the change of president was \"legal and constitutional\" and that Nasheed, in effect, had brought it on himself by his own actions.\n\"The resignation of President Nasheed was voluntary and of his own free will. It was not caused by any illegal coercion or intimidation ... With regard to the idea that there was a coup d'etat, nothing in the Maldives changed in constitutional terms,\" the Coni report stated. Waheed's succession to the presidency was \"legitimate\" and \"proper\". In one concession to the opposition, the report called for a full inquiry into police brutality.\nThe Coni report has caused predictable outrage, provoking new demonstrations last week. At a rally of 3,000 protesters in the capital, Male, Nasheed repeated his demand for early elections. \"Now we have a very awkward situation and in many ways very comical, where toppling a government by brutal force is taken as a reasonable course of action,\" he said.\nIn a shameful bit of back-tracking, Britain, the US and the Commonwealth all issued statements welcoming the Coni report, calling for dialogue – and dropping their previous support for early polls. Waheed is now saying fresh elections will not take place until November next year. This approach appears to contravene the Commonwealth's 1995 declaration in Milbrook, New Zealand, that efforts should be made \"to encourage the restoration of democracy within a reasonable time frame\" when a government has been overthrown. \"The Coni report came as a shock to many of the people who witnessed the events of 7 February ... So many established facts were ignored in the report, material and evidence of vital significance has been disregarded,\" said a prominent Nasheed supporter who asked not to be identified for fear of official reprisals. \"It was some high ranking police officers and some [military] people who helped to bring this coup. Public are calling them baaghees (traitors) … Today Maldives is a police state.\"\n"

We have been hearing allegations for a year and a half now, now we clearly have charges against high ranking officials at a foreign subsidiary,\" he said.\nThe new charges, and the allegation of bribery of a military official, come at a very sensitive time for the company. The media giant is preparing to split itself in two, separating the TV and broadcasting arm from the scandal-hit newspaper and publishing division.\nThe developments also bring to a crashing halt the recent perception in America that News Corporation had begun to recover its confidence after months on the defensive as a result of the phone-hacking scandal. Only on Monday, the New York Times ran an article headlined Clouds Lifting Over Murdoch, He's Out to Buy Again.\nNews Corp has largely shrugged off the scandal in the US, where its shares have risen over 34% in the last year. At News Corp's recent annual shareholder meeting in October, Murdoch comfortably saw off attempts to appoint an independent chairman to the company. James Murdoch has recently been tipped to head Fox Networks, the News Corp television division that includes its flagship Fox channel, home to The Simpsons and American Idol.\nBut the new charges will increase pressure on the company. Koehler said US authorities would be looking to see how high up the chain of command the bribery scandal reached. \"The question will be what did James know and when did he know it,\" he said. Ultimately he predicted News Corp would reach a settlement with the Justice Department rather than go to trial, but he said that News Corp faced some uncomfortable investigations in the coming months.\nThe FCPA has two main components, one that relates to the bribing of foreign officials and another that relates to books and record keeping. It is often the latter that causes companies the biggest headaches. Characterising a bribe as \"miscellaneous expense\" is a serious offence.\n\"This latest news is an escalation of the FCPA case,\" said Koehler. But he said he expected the case could still take some years to be resolved.\nThe latest legal difficulties to hit News Corporation could also potentially have ramifications on its 27 TV licences within the Fox network – the real financial heart of the operation. Three of the licences are up for renewal, and in August the ethics watchdog Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (Crew) filed a petition with the US broadcasting regulator, the Federal Communications Commission, that called for them to be denied on the grounds that the company did not have the requisite character to run a public service.\nMelanie Sloan, Crew's director, said the charges of the four former News International employees played into its petition. \"News Corp argues that the conduct in Britain shouldn't matter here in the US, but the Atlantic ocean doesn't have cleansing properties – if Murdoch is seen to be unfit to run a global company in the UK, then he's unfit in this country, too.\"\nIn May, the UK Commons culture committee censured Murdoch in their report into the phone hacking scandal, saying that he was \"not a fit person\" to exercise stewardship of a major international company.\nSo far there have been no confirmed cases of News Corporation employees engaging in illegal activities within the US. This week the Daily Beast alleged that the Murdoch tabloids the Sun and the New York Post may have made payments to a US official on American soil in order to obtain a photo of a captive Saddam Hussein, the deposed Iraqi leader, in his underwear. News Corporation has denied the claims.\nMark Lewis, the UK-based lawyer who has represented many of the victims of News of the World hacking, has been investigating possible cases of data breaches within the US but has yet to issue legal proceedings.\n"

        "text": "\nAs the South Korean Olympic team head home from London 2012 with 28 medals, they may be reflecting on the challenges they faced balancing the pressure of a nation to win, with competing in a responsible and fair way in the Games. This is comparable with the pressure companies have to generate profit whilst operating responsibly in emerging markets like South Korea.\nCorruption continues to be a key challenge for a business seeking to operate responsibly in South Korea. Ranked by Transparency International in 2011 as the 43rd most corrupt country out of 182, recent reports have questioned the effectiveness of anti-corruption law in South Korea and its enforcement. According to a report from Herbert Smith on anti-corruption in Asia, South Korea's Act on Preventing Bribery of Foreign Officials in International Business Transaction has only led to nine convictions in 13 years. Few Korean companies are revealing data on political 'donations' (comparable to facilitation payments in the West) in their CR reports.\nHowever, there is evidence that combating corruption is moving up the South Korean agenda. Just this week, the country's anti-corruption agency announced that it will seek to introduce a law that would mean government officials caught accepting more than 1 million won ($883) worth of bribes or entertainment could face punishment of up to three years in prison even without evidence of influence peddling. Disgraced officials would also need to pay back five times the amount they received. In addition, lobbyists and civil servants will incur significant fines if they are found to have sought illicit favours from public officials, whether or not any money was involved. It is therefore imperative for companies operating in South Korea – particularly for those with a presence in the UK – to ensure that there are strong anti-bribery and corruption policies and procedures in place.\nTo date, much of South Korea's economic prosperity has been on the back of conglomerates - or chaebol – such as LG Electronics and Samsung. The governance structure of the chaebol has traditionally been complex with little transparency and many chaebol executives having a strong presence in the political arena. However, in the aftermath of the Asian Financial Crisis of 1997, South Korean society's attention has turned to the role of business in society and the importance of ethical and transparent management. While there has been some reform in governance of the chaebol, relationships between them and politicians remain close and the resulting lack of transparency can be challenging when trying to do business with them.\nAs with other emerging Asian markets, cultural influences stemming from for instance, traditional Korean Confucianism and Buddhism, have significant influence over employees' behaviour in the workplace. Reflecting the Confucian values of loyalty to one's group, 'whistleblowing' – or naebu gobalja – carries negative connotations that are associated with betraying your employer more than with protecting the public good. The government has demonstrated commitment to reversing this perception and has recently introduced an Act on the Protection of Public Interest Whistleblowers. The Act came into force in September 2011 and is designed to protect individuals who report violations of the public interest to certain prescribed bodies (eg their employer) against suffering 'disadvantageous measures'. Disadvantageous measures could include dismissal, disciplinary action or other employment-related bias against a whistleblower. Companies need to ensure they have effective non-retaliation policies in place and support the government's efforts in this area.\nNon-profit organisations and South Korean consumers are showing greater interest in corporate responsibility activities including environmental protection. Research by the Korean Chamber of Industry and Trade in 2007 found that 80% of 500 business people survey stated that they preferred to buy goods from companies that champion social causes. And Korea's Green Growth plan includes the objectives of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 30% of its previously projected growth by 2020, increasing the share of renewable energies in its total energy supply to 11% by 2030, and promoting the development of 27 core green technologies that would provide future engines of growth for its economy. There are high expectations on businesses to contribute to this and address the problem of environmental degradation which has arisen from periods of unrestrained and rapid economic growth. Companies entering the South Korean market should bear this in mind and ensure they uphold high environmental standards.\nJudith Irwin is a senior researcher at the Institute of Business Ethics.

        "text": "\nA merger of BAE Systems and EADS could produce an arms company so big it would operate beyond the reach of the law, the author of a report on corruption in the defence industry has warned.\n\"This will be a huge defence company in Europe and there will be a concern that it will be above prosecution, almost like the banks,\" said Mark Pyman, director of the defence and security programme at Transparency International UK.\nHe said that if the planned £30bn merger went ahead, the company should set up an independent board to ensure it did not indulge in bribery and corruption.\nThe warning adds another potential obstacle to the deal, which has already run into political headwinds as governments from Berlin to Washington argue about how and where the new company would be run.\nThe British, German and French governments all have stakes in the companies' merger and the US administration is the biggest customer of BAE.\nPyman was speaking prior to the launch of an unprecedented study looking at defence companies around the world and their attitudes towards corruption.\nTransparency International's first anti-corruption index shows that British and US firms have responded to past scandals by adopting a much more rigorous approach towards corruption than continental European firms, including EADS. There were significant differences between BAE and EADS in their approaches to transparency and disclosure, Pyman said.\nBAE came up at the top of band B in the index, while EADS only made band C. Neither EADS nor any French defence company agreed to supply internal company information to the compilers of the study, even on a confidential basis.\n\"If the merger goes ahead it is really important that the combined companies have anti-corruption systems at least equal to BAE's, and which really should be in band A,\" Pyman said.\nHe spoke of BAE's slush fund for secret payments to Saudi dignitaries in a contract initiated in the 1980s (which was exposed by the Guardian), the payments to foreign governments by the US company Lockheed Martin in the 1970s, and the 2003 bribery scandal involving Boeing employees over a contract for a new US air force tanker aircraft. \"It is clear that scandals have had an immense effect on changing a company's behaviour.\"\nThe TI study concludes that two-thirds of the world's biggest defence firms do not provide enough public evidence on how they fight corruption. It states: \"Defence corruption threatens everyone – taxpayers, soldiers, governments, companies. With huge contracts and high secrecy in the defence sector there are numerous opportunities to hide corruption away from public scrutiny.\n\"A company website is the best place for a company to tell the world exactly how it fights corruption.\"\nPyman said: \"Corruption in defence is dangerous, divisive, wasteful. The cost is paid by everyone. Governments and taxpayers do not get value for their money and clean companies lose business to corrupt [ones]. Money wasted on defence corruption could be better spent.\"\nLord Robertson, a former Nato secretary general, said: \"Companies must have a reputation for zero tolerance to corruption … a corruption scandal can wipe away decades spent building a reputation.\"\nThe 10 British firms in the TI index are Babcock International Group, BAE Systems, Chemring Group, Cobham, GKN, Meggitt, QinetiQ Group, Rolls-Royce, Serco Group, and Ultra Electronics Holdings.\nBAE scored high band B ratings for both its public information on corruption and ethics (on websites, for example) and for its \"internal information\", the facts a firm might tell its staff about good practices.\nEADS, which is registered in the Netherlands, scored a low band C rating, and it declined to provide internal information in confidence to the TI study team that was led by Pyman. France, which has a significant stake in EADS, fares particularly badly. The report says: \"There is a strong need for French defence companies to be much more transparent in disclosing what they have in place by way of ethics and compliance systems.\"\nAn EADS spokesperson said: \"We are committed to full compliance with the highest standards of integrity and transparency. We work continuously to cooperate with initiatives to raise those standards.\"\nThe Association of French Aerospace Industries advised French defence companies to decline to provide TI with any internal information.\n\"It means that we are unable to provide any insight into whether these companies do have good internal systems,\" the report says.\nOn the basis of available public information, the company Thales comes out relatively well, with a band B rating, but Dassault, manufacturer of Rafale aircraft, and which recently beat BAE's Eurofighter/Typhoon to a multibillion-pound deal with India, comes off badly, with a band E score.\nOnly four companies – Fluor Corporation , Accenture, Hewlett-Packard and Britain's Serco Group – scored a grade A in \"risk management\", measuring how companies assess decisions to counter corrupt influences and use due diligence to curb corrupt behaviour by intermediaries.\nThe TI report says it is surprising so few defence firms take corruption seriously since most countries must comply with international anti-corruption laws, such as the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the recent UK Bribery Act, which have extraterritorial reach.\nTransparency International is a charity set up to combat corruption and promote good practice in companies in all sectors, not only defence.\nSFO investigates GPT\nThe Serious Fraud Office is conducting a criminal investigation into GPT Special Project Management, a British subsidiary of EADS. The investigation concerns payments and gifts allegedly given to Saudi generals.\nGPT sells communications equipment to the Saudi national guard via a government-to-government programme intimately involving the Ministry of Defence.\nThe management of the £2bn project, called Sangcom, has been monitored by an MoD team headed by a British general. Saudi payments to GPT go through an MoD bank account.\nIan Foxley, a former colonel in the British army who blew the whistle on the project, has given detailed evidence to the SFO.\nHe told the Guardian that fraud investigators should not be allowed to distinguish between individuals allegedly involved in wrongdoing, and the company which employed them. It had been too easy to let either individuals or firms off the hook.\nUnder a memoranda of understanding with the Saudi Arabian government, the MoD places contracts with British contractors. Some MoD officials appear to have expressed concern about payments made to a Cayman Islands bank account by GPT as early as 2008, the Financial Times reported.\n"

The idea is to \"thicken forces in and around Kandahar to impede the insurgency and deal with malign elements there\", he said during a visit to London.\nHis message – likely to be echoed in Brussels tomorrow by Nato secretary general Anders Rasmussen – is that Operation Omid is not about killing Taliban fighters. \"It is about protecting the population, about changing the political culture and perception.\n\"Kandahar is, from the psychological and communications point of view, the heartland of the Taliban,\" he said. \"The biggest problem in Afghanistan is not the Taliban, but the lack of strong governance and the delivery of services.\"\nHe said the \"primary focus\" was the \"politics in the city, sidelining the malign elements\". Clearly referring to moves to start talks with Taliban leaders, he added: \"In Kandahar the Taliban is part of the fabric of society. That is the reality.\"\n"

        "text": "\nCelebratory gunfire erupted in Mogadishu on Monday night after Hassan Sheikh Mohamud defeated incumbent Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed to become Somalia's new president.\nIt is the first time since the 1991 overthrow of president Said Barre that a new leader has been chosen inside the country, a development hailed by the UN as a sign of improving security. But the process has been tainted by allegations of bribery and corruption.\nMPs marked their ballot papers behind a curtain before casting them in a clear box in front of foreign envoys and hundreds of Somali men and women. In a surprise result, Mohamud won a runoff by 190 votes to 79 after the first round failed to produce a clear winner.\nMohamud, 57, is a professor and activist who has worked for several national and international peace and development organisations including the UN children's agency Unicef. Last year, frustrated by Somalia's dominant clan system, he founded what he claimed was the first political party in Mogadishu, the Peace and Development party.\nTouching a Qur'an with his right hand, Mohamud was sworn in as president within minutes of his poll victory. Ahmed, the outgoing president, conceded defeat after the onlookers in the hall spontaneously stood up and sang the national anthem.\n\"I am happy to see the first free and fair election happen in Somalia after 40 years,\" he said. \"I want to congratulate the new president for the fair election, and I want to declare that I am fully satisfied with the results.\"\nOutgoing prime minister Abdiweli Mohamed Ali, who threw his weight behind Mohamud's candidacy, said the result heralded a new era for Somali politics. \"Somalia voted for change,\" he told Reuters, adding it was too early to say if he would take part in the new administration.\nAmong the countless issues in the new president's intray will be piracy off the Somali coast, which has led to millions of pounds worth of armed defences for international shipping. In an interview with the Guardian at his office in Mogadishu last month, Mohamud accused foreign powers of hypocrisy.\n\"Somalis are confused,\" he said. \"The international community is putting a lot of resources towards it. Why not address the illegal fishing in Somali seas? People are getting the notion that international forces are there to protect the illegal fishing. The Somali fisherman cannot go to the sea because he will be considered a pirate.\"\nReferring to allegations that European firms dump toxic waste off the Somali coast, he added: \"Why the international community not say anything? It's delicate.\"\nBut Mohamud rejected the idea of offering pirates an amnesty. \"That will only encourage more. They have to be given some incentive but not that. Give them skills and rehabilitation and the opportunity to learn a better life.\nAlthough Islamist militant group al-Shabaab has been driven out of Mogadishu, assassinations and suicide bombings remain a constant threat. As president, Mohamud will now be a prime target. He admitted: \"Anybody who lives here in Mogadishu always lives under enormous risk. We have a coping mechanism but it doesn't always work.\n\"The fear factor is very strong. It makes the people quiet, it makes people behave differently. If we let the fear factor control us, we will never move ahead.\"\nMohamud has received threats from al-Shabaab in the past. \"Someone called my wife to say, 'You'll have to take care of your orphan soon.' Al-Shabaab targets everybody who is doing something against them– a woman in civil society, a traditional elder, a businessman, a religious leader.\n\"Al-Shabaab is not an ordinary militia like a clan militia. It is an ideology. You cannot fight an ideology only. That is what the government is doing. Military al-Shabaab is defeated; the areas they control are because nobody wants them, but still the ideology is there. We need a multi-faceted war against them. If we continue like this, the suicide bombings will continue.\"\nContinued peace in Mogadishu is far from assured, he said. \"If Amisom [African Union forces] left the state house, the president will not be there. Somalia doesn't have 100 trained soldiers capable of defending it. They are killing machines, trained in militia camps. They do not see themselves as servants of the people.\n\"If you go through Mogadishu, you can see it is different from 18 months ago. But the question is, how sustainable is this? It's still very fragile. Amisom cannot be here forever. We Somalis need to have our own security forces.\"\nDuring the interview, Mohamud presented himself as a political outsider untainted by the UN-backed transitional federal government (TFG) and its \"failure of leadership\". In July, a UN report said it had found that out of every $10 in revenue raised between 2009-10, $7 had never made it into state coffers.\nGraft had become endemic, Mohamud said. \"The leaders see the state as a money-making machine. They don't want to confine their power. Corruption was an important factor that contributed and still does today.\"\nHe said the selection of MPs was flawed but his party had backed the process and a new constitution. Little guessing that he would emerge the victor, he added: \"It is a defining time in Somalia. I'm not saying Somalia will get what it deserves but it will be better than the status quo.\"\nMohamud graduated from the Somali National University in 1981 and went on to study in India, where he obtained a master's degree from Bhopal University in 1988. He returned home and taught as a professor, including at the Somali Institute of Management and Administration Development, which he helped found in 1999. Its goal is to train administrators and technicians who can help rebuild the country.\nThe vote was seen as a culmination of a regionally brokered and UN-backed roadmap. There has been no effective central government control over most of the largely lawless country since the outbreak of civil war in 1991.\n"

        "text": "\nThe bosses of some of Britain's biggest arms and oil companies have refused to attend a parliamentary inquiry into the use of hundreds of millions of pounds of taxpayers' money to help dictators build arsenals and facilitate environmental and human rights abuses.\nThe businessmen, including Ian King, chief executive of BAE Systems, had been invited to an all-party investigation into the Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD)'s underwriting of loans, including £35m to Robert Mugabe's Zimbabwe to buy five Hawk fighter jets.\nThe all-party parliamentary group on international corporate responsibility is examining more than 40 years of ECGD operations overseas which have led to it being dubbed the \"department for dodgy deals\" by the Jubilee Debt Campaign.\nArms and oil companies are the biggest users of ECGD underwriting because traditional lenders are often reluctant to support projects that have the potential to lead to environmental or human rights abuses.\nThe companies were asked to attend the hearing to offer their views on how best to reform the role of the ECGD, which is part of the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and has changed its operating name to UK Export Finance (UKEF).\nOther companies that decided not to send representatives include Thales, a French-owned arms group, and Carillion, a FTSE 250 construction company and the largest provider of outsourced management of defence facilities. Graham Farley, Carillion's director of export finance, pulled out the night before he was due to give evidence, according to Lisa Nandy, the Labour MP for Wigan and chair of the inquiry.\nAt the time of publication, Carillion had has not responded to Guardian inquiries as to the reason for Farley's withdrawal. Thales said in statement it did not believe \"there was any specific aspect that was particularly pertinent\" to the company and so declined to participate.\nBAE Systems, the ECGD's biggest customer, said last week that it would not send King or any other representative to the inquiry. In a one-page letter to Nandy, the company said: \"As you will know, there are already strict controls on defence exports in place, with which BAE Systems fully complies. Any item exported from the UK, which is subject to export control, needs a licence. The Export Control Organisation hold this responsibility and BAE Systems works closely with them to ensure compliance.\n\"We await the results of your inquiry with interest. However, BAE Systems does not intend to contribute further written or oral evidence.\"\nBAE used ECGD funding to support the notorious al-Yamamah \"oil for arms\" deal with Saudi Arabia, involving Tornado and Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft. BAE was investigated by the Serious Fraud Office amid allegations of bribery and corruption. The inquiry was dropped following the intervention of the then prime minister, Tony Blair.\nThe ECGD also loaned £35m to Zimbabwe to buy five Hawk fighter jets from BAE between 1989 and 1992. Zimbabwe, which was already heavily indebted at the time of the loans, spent £49m repaying the cost of the Hawks, according to a response to a freedom of information request from the Jubilee Debt Campaign. Mugabe's government deployed the jets in the 1998-2002 war in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Africa's most deadly conflict in modern history, which led to 5.4m deaths.\nBP has used ECGD support for a 1,760km joint venture oil pipeline through the Caucasus, the construction which has allegedly led to a catalogue of human rights abuses, but it also declined to send a representative to the inquiry. The company said it has submitted written evidence, but Nandy said she was disappointed that recipients of funding had declined to send representatives.\n\"This is the first of its kind, looking not just through the lens of economic growth or sustainability, but how the two can be successfully combined. In the wake of the financial crisis there is a widely recognised responsibility on business to help develop sustainable growth and uphold high ethical standards. This inquiry is an opportunity to do so,\" she said.\nIt was revealed at the inquiry that the ECGD's independent advisory body, the Export Guarantees Advisory Council, has never advised the business secretary Vince Cable, who is ultimately responsible for the loans, to withdraw support from a project. The chair of the EGAC, Andrew Wiseman, a partner at the law firm Stephenson Harwood, also disclosed that the oversight body meets Cable only once a year.\nNick Dearden, the director of Jubilee Debt Campaign, said: \"There's a huge amount of evidence which shows that neither UKEF nor its advisory council are able to hold the companies they support to human rights or environmental obligations.\n\"What standards do exist are applied to less than half of UKEF's current portfolio, are discretionary in any case and give no formal mechanism for complaint or evaluation. Most worrying of all, those affected by UKEF-supported projects have no right to redress.\n\"In recent years companies with allegations of corruption against them have been given support, while campaigners have had to use separate channels to hold companies to account for failing their human rights obligations. The case for binding, mandatory rules has clearly been made. Parliament needs to act.\"\n"

        "text": "\nControversial links between the FTSE 100 mining group Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation and an Israeli businessman with high-level contacts in the Democratic Republic of Congo have returned to plague the company on the eve of its annual general meeting in London on Tuesday.\nAnti-corruption campaigner Global Witness is urging ENRC to publish the results of an internal inquiry into allegations made by at least two whistleblowers at the firm, which is understood to include an investigation into the group's ties to Israeli tycoon Dan Gertler.\nGertler has been dogged by accusations that a close relationship with DRC president Joseph Kabila has allowed him to buy interests in the country's mining assets on the cheap. The Global Witness report states: \"The offshore shell companies associated with Mr Gertler and paid by ENRC are obscure entities which have been registered in secrecy jurisdictions and have therefore not declared their full list of beneficiaries. Global Witness believes that these offshore structures could allow corrupt Congolese officials to benefit from these deals. If this is correct, ENRC may have poured money into corrupt transactions.\"\nENRC has acquired stakes in mining concessions from Gertler at prices that appear to have delivered the Israeli's offshore companies handsome – and speedy – profits. The FTSE 100 group's purchases have also been criticised for being at levels significantly less than the true market value, meaning the company and its partner could have profited at the expense of one of the poorest populations on Earth.\nThe call for more transparency at ENRC comes after the mining company's new chairman, Mehmet Dalman, refused to back Gertler in an interview with the Guardian last week. When asked if he has ever had any concerns about doing business with the Israeli, Dalman replied: \"You know that is such a leading question I'm not even going to respond to it, right? … Any comment I make, whatever you write down, it will not look right. Why would I answer that question? It is a no-win situation for me. Don't give me questions that I will look bad on, right? Come on. Be fair.\"\nThe Global Witness report lists five deals it is concerned about that ENRC has completed in the DRC. Its questions centre on how Gertler's offshore companies \"obtained their licences in deals that were conducted in secrecy and not subject to public tenders\"; how the offshore entities \"have not revealed their full list of beneficiaries [so] there is a risk that these beneficiaries could include corrupt Congolese officials\"; and how \"in at least two cases ENRC bankrolled the initial purchases by Gertler-related offshore companies instead of doing business directly with the Congolese government\".\nScrutiny of these deals – plus similar transactions conducted with Gertler by FTSE 100 commodity trader Glencore – have led to promises of a parliamentary investigation. Last month, Pauline Latham MP, a member of the international development select committee, issued a statement asking: \"Are London-listed firms using Dan Gertler and shell companies to navigate around anti-bribery legislation?\"\nGlencore, ENRC and Gertler deny any wrongdoing and say the transactions were properly conducted. In response to the Global Witness report, ENRC said: \"ENRC is committed to upholding the highest standards of corporate governance and implements a zero-tolerance policy to bribery and corruption across all of our operations. In bringing significant and much-needed investment to the DRC, ENRC has fully complied with regulations and disclosure obligations.\" A spokesman for Gertler's Fleurette Group said: \"Fleurette has continually stated that the only beneficiaries [of Fleurette Group] are the Gertler Family Trust for the family members of Dan Gertler.\"\n"

But he was forced to quit on Tuesday after just three years and three months in office.\nNasheed, who had been educated in his own country, Sri Lanka and Britain, completed a BA in maritime studies at Liverpool John Moores University, before becoming an outspoken critic of Gayoom's regime.\nHe was first arrested in 1990 after writing a magazine article on government corruption. Over the following years he spent long periods in jail, under house arrest, banishment to a distant atoll, and exile, victim of political persecution and increasing focus for the opposition at home and abroad.\nHe was elected to parliament in 2000 and with others sought to establish the Maldivian Democratic party (MDP), before facing what his supporters said was a trumped-up charge of theft of government property the following year.\nIn November 2003, Nasheed left the Maldives and became a co-founder of MDP in political exile. His havens included Salisbury in Wiltshire. Being granted political asylum by the UK helped build the pressure on Gayoom.\nIn April 2005, Nasheed returned to Male, two months before the MDP was officially recognised there.\nIn August 2005, he was arrested again and charged with terrorism, but Gayoom's grip on the Maldives was weakening and in the same year the president agreed a roadmap to reform.\nA few months after his 2008 election, Nasheed announced his intention for the Maldives to become carbon-neutral within a decade, and in October 2009 presided over the world's first underwater cabinet meeting.\nLater he admitted it was a publicity stunt, telling the Hay festival: \"The Maldives are a small country and we cannot bomb a city to get people's attention … If the Maldives were to disappear, where would the butterflies and the sounds go?\"\nRasheed was then made a United Nations Champion of the Earth but by June 2010 he was facing political crisis at home as his cabinet resigned, claiming the opposition was making it impossible to govern and accusing parliamentarians of bribery and corruption.\nWeeks later he was being named by Newsweek as one of the world's top 10 leaders and, in November 2011, David Cameron described him to the Guardian as \"my new best friend\".\n"

        "title": "China's Huawei and ZTE pose national security threat, says US committee",

        "text": "\nAmerican companies and its government should avoid doing business with China's two leading technology firms, Huawei and ZTE, because they pose a national security threat to the US, the House of Representatives' intelligence committee will warn in a report to be published on Monday.\nThe Republican-controlled panel also says US regulators should block mergers and acquisitions in the US by the two companies, which are among the world's leading suppliers of telecommunications gear and mobile phones.\nThe panel's report will cause transatlantic friction over the role of the Chinese companies. In the UK, Huawei is a major supplier to the telecoms provider BT, and has supplied infrastructure being used in the new 4G superfast mobile network built by Everything Everywhere – the merged Orange/T-Mobile. Huawei provides access to its source code for GCHQ specialists who have reportedly examined it for threats and passed it as safe for use.\nHuawei is a private company founded by a former Chinese military engineer, and has grown rapidly to become the world's second largest supplier, behind Sweden's Ericsson, of telecommunications network gear, with operations in more than 140 countries. ZTE is the world's fourth largest mobile phone manufacturer, with 90,000 employees worldwide, and fifth-largest maker of telecoms equipment.\nWhile both companies' sales of mobile devices such as smartphones have grown in the US, espionage fears have proscribed any move into network infrastructure sales.\nZTE has also enjoyed growth in its sale of mobile devices, although in recent months it has faced allegations about banned sales of US-sanctioned computer equipment to Iran. The FBI is probing reports that the company obstructed a US Commerce Department investigation into the sales.\nThe intelligence panel says ZTE refused to provide any documents on its activities in Iran, but did provide a list of 19 individuals who serve on the Chinese communist party committee within the company. ZTE's citing of China's state secrecy laws for limiting information it could release only added to concern over Chinese government influence over its operations, the report says.\nReflecting growing US governmental and commercial concern over cyber-attacks traced to China, the report also recommends that US government computer systems not include any components from the two firms because that could pose an espionage risk.\n\"China has the means, opportunity, and motive to use telecommunications companies for malicious purposes,\" the report says. It also raises the diplomatic temperature by warning that \"Huawei and ZTE have failed to assuage the committee's significant security concerns presented by their continued expansion into the US … In fact, given their obstructionist behaviour, the committee believes addressing these concerns have become an imperative for the country.\"\nBut Huawei's US vice-president for external affairs, William Plummer, hit back: \"Baseless suggestions otherwise or purporting that Huawei is somehow uniquely vulnerable to cyber mischief ignore technical and commercial realities, recklessly threaten American jobs and innovation, do nothing to protect national security, and should be exposed as dangerous political distractions from legitimate public-private initiatives to address what are global and industry-wide cyber challenges,\" he said. Huawei is a \"globally trusted and respected company,\" he said, insisting that it had cooperated with investigators.\nZTE said it \"profoundly disagrees\" with the committee's claims: \"ZTE should not be a focus of this investigation to the exclusion of the much larger western vendors,\" it commented in an open letter.\nThe recommendations are the result of a year-long probe, including a congressional hearing last month in which senior Chinese executives of both companies testified, and denied posing a security threat. The most recent hearing, in September, was titled \"Open hearing on national security threats posted by Huawei and ZTE\".\nThe bipartisan report is likely to become fodder for a presidential campaign in which the candidates have been competing over their readiness to clamp down on Chinese trade violations. The Republican candidate Mitt Romney, in particular, has made it a key point to get tougher on China by designating it a currency manipulator and fighting abuses such as intellectual property theft.\nThe committee made the draft available to reporters and wire services in advance of public release on Monday, but only under the condition that they not publish stories until the broadcast Sunday of a CBS 60 Minutes report on Huawei. In the CBS report, the committee's chairman, Republican Rep Mike Rogers, urged American companies not to do business with Huawei.\n\"Find another vendor [than Huawei] if you care about your intellectual property; if you care about your consumers' privacy and you care about the national security of the United States of America,\" Rogers said in comments broadcast on the programme.\nThe panel's recommendations are likely hamper Huawei and ZTE's ambitions to expand their business in the US. Their products are used in scores of countries, including in the west. Both deny being influenced by China's communist government.\n\"The investigation concludes that the risks associated with Huawei's and ZTE's provision of equipment to US critical infrastructure could undermine core US national-security interests,\" the report says.\nThe report says the committee received information from industry experts and current and former Huawei employees suggesting that Huawei, in particular, may be violating US laws. It says that the committee will refer the allegations to the US government for further review and possible investigation. The report mentions allegations of immigration violations, bribery and corruption, and of a \"pattern and practice\" of Huawei using pirated software in its US facilities.\nAn unclassified version of the report will be released at 15:00 BST, though a classified annex with \"significantly more information adding to the committee's concerns\" will remain redacted.\nSimilar concerns have led the Australian government to ban Huawei from bidding as a supplier to the A$38bn National Broadband Network (NBN). And in November 2011, the US online security company Symantec dissolved a joint venture in which it was the 49% minority partner with Huawei because it feared being shut out of US government business.\nHowever, \"Huawei has not and will not jeopardize our global commercial success nor the integrity of our customers' networks for any third party, government or otherwise,\" senior vice-president Charles Ding testified to the committee in September, suggesting it would be corporate suicide to do so.\nThe report says the companies failed to provide responsive answers about their relationships and support by the Chinese government, and detailed information about their operations in the US. Huawei, in particular, is criticised for failing to provide thorough information, including on its corporate structure, history, financial arrangements and management.\n\"The committee finds that the companies failed to provide evidence that would satisfy any fair and full investigation. Although this alone does not prove wrongdoing, it factors into the committee's conclusions,\" it says.\nIn Washington, Huawei executive Plummer said on Friday that the company co-operated in good faith with the investigation, which he said had not been objective and amounted to a \"political distraction\" from cybersecurity problems facing the entire industry.\nAll major telecommunications firms, including those in the west, develop and manufacture equipment in China and overlapping supply chains require industry-wide solutions, he added. Singling out China-based firms wouldn't help.\nPlummer complained that the volume of information sought by the committee was unreasonable, and it had demanded some proprietary business information that \"no responsible company\" would provide.\nIn justifying its scrutiny of the Chinese companies, the committee contended that Chinese intelligence services, as well as private companies and other entities, often recruit those with direct access to corporate networks to steal trade secrets and other sensitive proprietary data.\nIt warned that malicious hardware or software implants in Chinese-manufactured telecommunications components and systems headed for US customers could allow Beijing to shut down or degrade critical national security systems in a time of crisis or war.\nThe committee concluded that Huawei likely has substantially benefited from the support of the Chinese government.\nHuawei denies being financed to undertake research and development for the Chinese military, but the committee says it has received internal Huawei documentation from former employees showing the company provides special network services to an entity alleged to be an elite cyberwarfare unit within the People's Liberation Army.\nThe intelligence committee recommended that the government's Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, bar mergers and acquisitions by both Huawei and ZTE. CFIUS is a multi-agency regulatory panel chaired by treasury secretary Timothy Geithner, and screens foreign investment proposals for potential national security threats.\nLast year, Huawei had to unwind its purchase of a US computer company, 3Leaf Systems, after it failed to win CFIUS approval. However, Huawei employs 1,700 people in the US, and business is expanding. US revenues rose to $1.3bn in 2011, up from $765m in 2010.\n"

        "title": "Banks, drugmakers and arms dealers  are the new face of our piratical past",

        "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jul/08/bankers-drugmakers-arms-dealers-britain-piratical-past",
        "text": "\nBritain's bankers are swashbuckling pirates in a long tradition that stretches back 400 years. Pirating is not exclusive to Britain, but we have always been adept at stealing and extorting under the guise of free trade. Britain's merchant class created the largest empire the world has known using the techniques learned on the high seas: much of the booty our forebears crowed about was money deftly stolen from others (who mostly stole it themselves). The East India Company gave the lead and successive governments followed.\nIn a recent BBC4 documentary, our history was characterised as a tension between roundheads and cavaliers. Cavaliers, from Sir Walter Raleigh onwards, rarely relied on efficiency or productivity or having the largest ships, but skirmished with frigates to bamboozle and destroy the enemy.\nIn the modern business world, that equates to waking up each day with a determination to live on your wits and deploy every tactic in your bag of tricks to sell whatever you have to hand.\nDavid Cameron was cast as the inheritor of the cavalier tradition. Bob Diamond, the deposed Barclays boss, is less colourful but represents an industry that revels in dealmaking and bamboozling its clients. Each day is another opportunity to invent a form of words, a complex scheme, that can command a premium over the simpler fare offered by rivals.\nThat doesn't mean there is a total absence of strategy. There are the sloggers who keep the economy moving even when cavaliers prefer a day at Cowes or Henley, or time on the golf courses of the Algarve. These are the roundheads: the civil servants, farmers, unflashy yeomen and women of the shires who piece together the business and social fabric of the nation and diligently maintain it. In politics, Vince Cable would be their leader.\nIn a recent article, Matthew Parris, the Times columnist and former Tory MP, said people who decry the activities of the banks need to throw off their naive view of Britain. He argues that a trading nation needs to live on its wits – and, more than that, fight dirty.\nFinancial services, the arms industry and the pharmaceuticals business can lay claim to being the UK's biggest net exporters. The balance of payments is bad at the moment, but would be much worse without them. Yet they all have one foot in the gutter.\nArms manufacturers are among the UK's biggest employers. Greece, until recently the world's sixth-largest importer of arms, is a long-standing client; so are many other nations who cannot really afford to tool up for wars they may never fight.\nThe arms trade tops the list of corrupt sectors, according to Transparency International, the non-governmental organisation that monitors global bribery and corruption. Britain's arms sector is the second-largest in the world. Surely that means we are winning contracts because we grease more palms?\nThe antics of GlaxoSmithKline fit less easily into the pirate image. It takes a lot of planning to bring a new drug to market: lots of diligent roundheads must toil in the laboratory for years before submitting their efforts to the regulators. But shareholders love a buccaneering boss. They deny it, but throw huge rewards to executives who can show the biggest returns.\nPharma bosses may not look much like pirates, but they have adopted the same tactics as the banks and the arms traders when it comes to selling their wares. There are plenty of instances of drugs trials that are less than rigorous, and marketing campaigns that target vulnerable customers, including the latest scandal at Glaxo.\nNew Labour ran scared of cleaning up naughty industries. Each one was characterised as a golden goose. But the time has come to throw off 400 years of history. A country run by roundheads may be less exciting, but fear and corruption breed economic instability, not success. If we can tame the cavaliers, more people, not fewer, will want to do business here.\nUnpromising away fixture\nRoll up, roll up: who wants to buy shares in a famous Cayman Islands-incorporated company? It doesn't pay a dividend, or have plans to do so, since it's currently got £423m of debt, which is £90m more than last year's revenue. And your shares will carry only one tenth of the voting power of the insiders', so don't get fancy ideas about your importance.\nNot tempted? Come on, this is Manchester United, arriving on the New York Stock Exchange soon.\nThere's a price for everything, of course, so, after a false start in Singapore, the Glazer family should achieve a public listing for their football club as long as they don't get greedy on valuation. Would-be investors, however, should understand what they would be buying into.\nFirst, this float is happening in the US because dual-voting structures have been deemed unacceptable by UK investors for about two decades. There's an excellent reason for that – equal economic risk should carry equal votes. The likes of Google and Facebook might be able to argue that the entrepreneurial talents of their founders are best retained through a form of benign dictatorship. But the Glazer/Man U combination doesn't fit that description. The voting structure here is about control, pure and simple.\nSecond, the stock won't be actively traded, even if the Glazers issue as much as £200m of new shares (and the rumour is it will be less than half that). Illiquid stocks tend to suffer a discount to fair value, other factors being equal. And most UK private shareholders will have to pay top-tier dealing fees to dabble in a US-listed firm.\nThird, the only point in owning a non-dividend-paying share is the hope of capital appreciation. At Man U, the big event for shareholders (and fans) will come on the day the Glazers decide to exit. When's that? Next year? Next decade? Some time after that? Until it arrives, outside investors are back-seat passengers who won't know the destination. To be attractive, the pricing of this flotation needs to be well below premier league.\nGrand gesture at Ulster Bank\nTwo and a half weeks have passed since the NatWest computer blackout left thousands of customers without access to their money. At Ulster Bank, the problems rumble on and might continue, it admits, for another two weeks.\nUlster Bank's chief executive, Jim Brown, told an Irish parliamentary committee on Friday that there would now be a full inquiry into what has been described as a \"glitch\" – though that is far too small a word for a problem that will have affected more than 500,000 Irish customers for up to a month. Compensation will be paid to any customer who has lost out.\nWhat's more, Brown said, he had decided to waive his own annual bonus – an \"I feel your pain\" gesture to identify with customers who have been unable to find out if their salaries have been paid in or make bill payments.\nIs he expecting applause for such a magnanimous gesture? A more apt response would be to question why any bonus might have been payable in the first place when Brown's job is to offer a banking service, and the service completely broke down.\n"

        "text": "\nBritain's arms industry and other companies are to be called before MPs to explain why taxpayer funds ended up helping Robert Mugabe to buy five Hawk fighter jets and 1,030 police Land Rovers which he later used to suppress dissent.\nThe bosses of the world's biggest multinational defence and oil companies, including BAE Systems and BP, will be asked to account for why hundreds of millions of pounds of government money was used to help military dictators build up their arsenals, and facilitated environmental and human rights abuses across the world.\nAn official all-party inquiry into the government Export Credits Guarantee Department's (ECGD) underwriting of the loans will begin to call witnesses next week, the Guardian has learned.\nThe all-party parliamentary group on international corporate responsibility will investigate more than 40 years of the government's involvement in supporting dubious practices overseas. The actions of the ECGD have led to it being christened the \"department for dodgy deals\" by the Jubilee Debt Campaign.\nAmong the catalogue of ethically questionable deals was £35m lent to Zimbabwe to buy five Hawk fighter jets from BAE Systems between 1989 and 1992.\nZimbabwe, which was already heavily indebted at the time of the loans, spent £49m repaying the cost of the Hawks, according to a response to a freedom of information request from the Jubilee Debt Campaign seen by the Guardian.\nMugabe's government deployed the jets in the 1998-2002 war in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Africa's most deadly conflict in modern history, which led to 5.4m deaths.\nAt the time of deployment the British government approved Zimbabwe's purchase of spare parts worth £5m-£10m despite concerns the aircraft were being used in the deadly Congo war, according to the journal Africana Bulletin.\nThe department also supplied Mugabe with £21m of loan guarantees to help him import 1,030 police Land Rovers and other military equipment. The vehicles were sent to Zimbabwe after Mugabe promised that they would be used \"with due respect for human rights\". He specifically pledged not to use them for riot control, but Amnesty International said they were used to crush demonstrations.\nThe Land Rovers were sent to Zimbabwe in the late 1990s, before Mugabe began taking over white farmers' land in 1999. Robin Cook, the former foreign secretary, later banned the shipments.\nThe ECGD also supported the notorious al-Yamamah \"oil for arms\" deal with Saudi Arabia, for which BAE Systems was investigated by the Serious Fraud Office amid allegations of bribery and corruption. The inquiry was eventually dropped following the intervention of the then prime minister, Tony Blair.\nThe government loans also allowed the former Egyptian dictator Hosni Mubarak, and his predecessor Anwar Sadat, to buy arms, including helicopters and missiles, and helped Argentina buy two Type 42 Destroyers and two Lynx helicopters, which were later used in the invasion of the Falklands.\nAs well as arms, the department has provided funds for the world's largest and riskiest oil-drilling project, in the Atlantic Ocean, and a 1,760km BP joint venture oil pipeline through the Caucasus.\nThe inquiry will this week begin asking arms and oil industry executives to provide evidence to parliament after pressure for the ECGD to clean up its act. The cross-party group of MPs will also call on former politicians to explain why they signed the deals. More than 100 MPs signed an early day motion calling for the ECGD to commit itself to transparent and open dealings in the future.\nThe ECGD, which is part of the business department and has changed its name to UK Export Finance (UKEF), was often used by arms companies to get a state-backed guarantee to recompense their banks if the deal fell through or the debtor failed to make repayments. In the 1980s the ECGD had 4,000 staff in branches across the country and offered backing for 40% of Britain's exports.\nLisa Nandy, a Labour MP and chair of the all party group, said the department had committed \"billions of pounds of taxpayers' money\" to projects that had been the subject of \"countless criticisms\" for human rights and environmental abuses.\n\"It is vital that we bring together all stakeholders and interested parties through this inquiry to look seriously at the allegations levelled at this department,\" she said.\n\"This Department commits billions of pounds of taxpayers' money each year. It has a responsibility to spend that money in a way that is ethical and effective. In the past it appears that this responsibility has not been taken seriously enough.\"\n\"In a time of recession, business needs support from government but that support must be of long-term benefit for everyone: safeguarding human rights, protecting the environment and, at the very least, not exacerbating poverty.\"\nTim Jones, policy officer at Jubilee Debt Campaign, said: \"We welcome the launch of this inquiry. Vince Cable's 'Department for Dodgy Deals' has a notorious track record of backing loans for undemocratic and damaging projects. UK Export Finance claims it is owed £2.3 billion. This includes loans for General Mubarak's Egyptian army to buy British defence equipment, Argentina's 1970s military dictatorship to buy British warships, and Robert Mugabe's police to buy British Land Rovers. Vince Cable needs to implement Liberal Democrat policy and audit the debt, cancel that which is unjust, and reform UK Export Finance so no more dodgy deals are backed in the future.\"\nThe inquiry has no legal power to force industry executives or former politicians to provide evidence.\n"
